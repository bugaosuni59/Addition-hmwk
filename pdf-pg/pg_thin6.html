<br>both individually and with alfalfa (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Medicago</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> spp.), 
<br>where stiff stems tend to keep alfalfa from lodging.   
<br> 
<br>Intermediate wheatgrass has fairly slow re-growth 
<br>following clipping and is best adapted to single crop-
<br>haying situations.  Intermediate wheatgrass responds 
<br>very well to irrigation with production nearing the 
<br>level of 'Regar' meadow brome (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Bromus 
<br>biebiersteinii</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">) and orchardgrass and exceeding

<br>normally out produce intermediate wheatgrass hay 
<br>production in multiple cutting situations.  
<br>Intermediate wheatgrass responds well to limited 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">irrigation.  It is able to tolerate droughty conditions 
<br>when irrigation ceases as long as about 12 inches of 
<br>total moisture is provided.  It provides excellent 
<br>spring, early summer, and fall pasture, but must be 
<br>carefully managed to ensure maintenance of the stand 
<br>and high production.  
<br> 
<br>Intermediate wheatgrass is palatable to all classes of 
<br>livestock and wildlife.  It is a preferred feed for 
<br>cattle, sheep, horses, deer, antelope, and elk in spring, 
<br>early summer and fall.  It is considered a desirable 
<br>feed for cattle, sheep, horses, and elk in summer and 
<br>winter.

<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Erosion control/reclamation</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">: Intermediate 
<br>wheatgrass is well adapted to the stabilization of 
<br>disturbed soils.  This grass can be used in critical and 
<br>urban areas where irrigation water is limited and to 
<br>stabilize ditchbanks, dikes, and roadsides.  This grass 
<br>can also be use to build soils because of its heavy 
<br>root production.  Levels as high as 7000 pounds (dry 
<br>weight) per acre of root production in the upper 8 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">inches of soil have been measured in five-year-old

<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">General</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">: Grass Family (Poaceae).  As one of the 
<br>common names implies, the spikes, spikelets, 
<br>glumes, lemmas, and leaves of what was considered 
<br>pubescent wheatgrass were densely covered with 
<br>hairs, whereas intermediate wheatgrass vegetative 
<br>structures are for the most part smooth, but may have 
<br>ciliate hairs on the leaf margins.  The materials of 
<br>both are now considered to be encompassed by the 
<br>species </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Thinopyrum intermedium</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">. 
<br>Intermediate wheatgrass grows to 3 to 4 feet tall.  It is 
<br>a long-lived, cool season grass with short rhizomes 
<br>and a deep feeding root system.  The seed spikes may 
<br>be up to 4 to 8 inches long.  Leaves are 4-8 mm wide 
<br>and green to blue-green in color and sometimes 
<br>drooping.  The lemmas, paleas, and glumes are 
<br>smooth to pubescent.  The glumes are acute to blunt, 
<br>generally five nerved, awnless to awn tipped.  The 
<br>florets are usually fewer than seven.  Intermediate 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">wheatgrass commercial seed often contains both 
<br>pubescent and glabrous forms.  
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Distribution</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">: Intermediate 
<br>wheatgrass is a perennial grass 
<br>introduced in 1932 from 
<br>Europe and Asia.  Included in 
<br>this group is a form that was 
<br>known as pubescent wheatgrass 
<br>(</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Agropyron trichophorum</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">), 
<br>which was introduced in 1934 
<br>from Europe and Asia and 
<br>considered slightly more 
<br>drought tolerant and winter 
<br>hardy.  For current U.S. 
<br>distribution, please consult the 
<br>Plant Profile page for this 
<br>species on the PLANTS Web 
<br>site.

<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Adaptation</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">: Intermediate wheatgrass is adapted to 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">areas with 12 to 13 inches of annual rainfall or 
<br>greater.  The pubescent form can tolerate slightly 
<br>more droughty conditions of about 11 to 12 inches of 
<br>rainfall or greater.  It performs best above 3500 and 
<br>up to 9000 feet elevation.  It can be seeded at lower 
<br>elevations, but its moisture requirement is greater.  It 
<br>is not as drought tolerant as 'Hycrest', 'Nordan', 
<br>'Ephraim', 'Douglas', 'Fairway' crested wheatgrasses 
<br>(</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Agropyron cristatum</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">); 'P27', 'Vavilov' Siberian

<br> 
<br>Intermediate wheatgrass prefers well drained loamy

<br>will tolerate slightly acidic to mildly saline 
<br>conditions, is cold tolerant, can withstand moderate 
<br>periodic flooding in the spring, and is very tolerant of 
<br>fire.  The pubescent form can tolerate lower fertility, 
<br>more alkaline soils, higher elevations, and drier 
<br>conditions than glabrous form.  It performs poorly on 
<br>wet, poorly drained, and moderately saline to alkaline 
<br>soils with prolonged inundation. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Planting</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">: It should be seeded with a drill at a depth of 
<br>1/2 inch or less on medium to fine textured soils and 
<br>no more than 1 inch deep on coarse textured soils.  
<br>Recommended seeding rates are 10 to 12 pounds 
<br>Pure Live Seed (PLS) per acre or 21 to 25 PLS seeds 
<br>per square foot.  A firm weed free seedbed enhances 
<br>stand establishment.  It is compatible with other 
<br>species, particularly alfalfa (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Medicago</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> spp.).  Stand 
<br>longevity and seeding with alfalfa can enhance 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">productivity.  If used as a component of a mix, adjust 
<br>to percent of mix desired.  The best dryland results 
<br>are obtained from seeding in very early spring on 
<br>heavy to medium textured soils and in late fall 
<br>(dormant) on medium to light textured soils.  
<br>Irrigated lands should be seeded in spring through 
<br>summer.  Late summer (August - mid September) 
<br>seedings are not recommended unless irrigation is 
<br>available. 
<br> 
<br>For mind lands, roadsides, and other harsh critical 
<br>areas, the seeding rate should be increased to 15 to 18 
<br>pounds PLS per acre or 31 to 38 PLS seeds per 
<br>square foot.  
<br> 
<br>Intermediate wheatgrass establishes fairly quickly, 
<br>more quickly than 'Regar' meadow brome or smooth 
<br>brome varieties.  Seedling vigor is good to excellent.  
<br>Under favorable conditions intermediate wheatgrass 
<br>provides good noxious weed suppression.  It makes 
<br>good spring growth, fair summer growth, and good 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">fall growth, if moisture is available.  Light, frequent 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">irrigation is beneficial for stand establishment.  
<br> 
<br>Protect a new seeding until it is fully established and 
<br>are able to withstand pulling by grazing animals 
<br>without being uprooted.  It is desirable to cut at least 
<br>one hay crop prior to grazing.  
<br> 
<br>Stands may require weed control measures during 
<br>establishment.  Application of 2,4-D should not be 
<br>made until plants have reached the four to six leaf 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">stages.  Mow weeds at or prior to their bloom stage.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Grasshoppers and other insects may also damage new 
<br>stands and pesticides may be needed.

<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Intermediate wheatgrass has good palatability to 
<br>livestock and wildlife.  Livestock and wildlife will 
<br>graze it throughout the growing season, but it is most 
<br>preferred as forage in spring, early summer, and fall.  
<br>It will not withstand heavy continuous grazing and 
<br>maintain a healthy productive stand.  Stands are not 
<br>as susceptible to spring and fall freezing as smooth 
<br>brome, meadow brome, or orchardgrass. 
<br> 
<br>Ten to twelve inches of new growth should be 
<br>attained in spring before grazing is allowed on 
<br>established stands.  A six-inch stubble height should 
<br>be maintained following each mowing and going into 
<br>winter.  In pasture tests, stands consistently out-yield 
<br>other grass-legume mixtures.  For this reason, 
<br>stocking rates can be set higher than other grasses.  
<br>Care should be taken to allow proper rest of 21 to 28 
<br>days between grazing periods in irrigated and high 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">moisture situations. 
<br> 
<br>When planted with a legume, harvest hay at optimum 
<br>stage for the legume.  This will allow the grass to be 
<br>harvested prior to flowering and result in very high 
<br>quality hay.  Harvest pure stands for hay when plants 
<br>start to flower. 
<br> 
<br>Apply nitrogen as needed to maintain vigorous 
<br>growth. Irrigated seedings and those in higher rainfall 
<br>zones (18 inches +) will respond well to annual 
<br>applications of 40 or more pounds of available 
<br>nitrogen per acre during the establishment year and 
<br>70 to 90 pounds per acre each fall.  A balance of 
<br>nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer needs to be 
<br>considered in order to maintain a legume component.  
<br>A soil test is recommended. 
<br> 
<br>Forage production can be restored and stands may 
<br>benefit from ripping if sodbound conditions occur.  
<br>Care should be taken to avoid excessive tillage 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">because stands may be damaged.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Environmental Concerns</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">: Intermediate is long-lived 
<br>(50+ years), spreads slowly vegetatively, and very 
<br>little via seed distribution.  It is not considered a 
<br>&quot;weedy&quot; or invasive species, but can spread into 
<br>adjoining vegetative communities under ideal 
<br>climatic and environmental conditions.  Research 
<br>indicates that most seedings do not spread from 
<br>original plantings.  It is known to coexist with native 
<br>taxa.  On favorable sites where it is best adapted, it 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">can maintain dominance and exist as a monoculture.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">There is no documentation that it crosses with native 
<br>species.

<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Seed production of intermediate wheatgrass is 
<br>generally not difficult.  If fields are maintained in 
<br>rows and adequate fertility levels are maintained, 
<br>seed can be produced for 7 to 10 years or more.  Row 
<br>spacing of 36 inches dryland and 24 to 36 inches 
<br>irrigated are recommended (although rhizomatous, 
<br>intermediate wheatgrass should be maintained in 
<br>rows).  Cultivation is required to maintain rows. 
<br> 
<br>Average production of 250 to 350 pounds per acre 
<br>can be expected under dryland conditions.  Average 
<br>production of 450 to 550 pounds per acre can be 
<br>expected under irrigated conditions.  Seed yields drop 
<br>significantly after about four years of production.  
<br>Swathing, followed by combining of the cured rows, 
<br>best completes harvesting.  The seed heads will 
<br>shatter when mature and if direct combining is 
<br>desired the stand should be harvested with 15 to 20 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">percent moisture.  This will require drying to 12 
<br>percent moisture before storing in bins and to 15 
<br>percent before storing in sacks.  Seed is generally 
<br>harvested in mid to late August.

<br>'Amur' intermediate wheatgrass was developed from 
<br>seed originally obtained from China by the Pullman 
<br>PMC and transferred to the Los Lunas PMC, New 
<br>Mexico and released by the PMC, New Mexico AES 
<br>and University Park in 1952.  It was selected for 
<br>leafiness, vigorous growth, strong seedling vigor, and 
<br>good seed production.  It is a slow sod former.  It was 
<br>originally released for revegetation of disturbed lands 
<br>and for pasture seedings at higher elevations.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Introgression has occurred resulting in a high

<br>Certified seed stock is no longer available.  It has 
<br>been replaced by species, which are more widely
