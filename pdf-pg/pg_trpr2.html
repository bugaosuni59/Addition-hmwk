<br>Uses 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Red clover is the most widely grown of all the true 
<br>clovers and is the most important legume hay crop in 
<br>the northeastern United States.  Red clover is 
<br>primarily used for hay, pasture, silage, and soil 
<br>improvement.  It is a quick growing crop, easily 
<br>established, and produces high quality forage.  Red 
<br>clover is commonly planted with cool season grasses 
<br>such as orchardgrass, tall fescue, brome grasses and 
<br>timothy.  It can also be grown alone or with some 
<br>warm season grasses such as dallisgrass and 
<br>johnsongrass. 
<br> 
<br>Many wildlife species use legumes and are attracted 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">to the early green up to help them recover from the 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">stress of winter.  Red clover is not particularly noted 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">for providing wildlife cover or food.  Bumblebees are 
<br>especially important in pollinating red clover but are 
<br>sometimes inadequate to insure a good seed crop.  
<br>Honey bees also pollinate red clover but tend to 
<br>prefer sweetclover, white clover and alsike clover if 
<br>these species are in the vicinity.

<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Description 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Trifolium pratense</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> L., red clover, is an introduced 
<br>biennial or short-lived perennial that grows as one of 
<br>two types: medium (double-cut) or mammoth</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px"> </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">(single-
<br>cut).  Red clover initiates growth from the plant 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">crown.  Plants have hollow, hairy stems and 
<br>branches.  Stem lengths of medium and mammoth 
<br>types average 18 inches and 24-30 inches, 
<br>respectively.  Medium types have about 4 branches 
<br>per stem; mammoth types have 6 branches per stem.  
<br>Each leaf consists of a slender stalk bearing 3 
<br>leaflets.  The taproot of red clover normally 
<br>disintegrates in the second year and plants that 
<br>survive have developed secondary, extensively 
<br>branched roots.  Flowers are borne in compact 
<br>clusters at the tips of the branches and are usually 
<br>rose-pink in color.  The flower shape is similar to pea 
<br>flowers except is more elongated and much smaller.  
<br>Flower heads usually consist of up to 125 flowers.  
<br>Seed pods are small, short, and contain kidney-
<br>shaped seeds that vary in color from yellow to deep 
<br>violet.  Plants of the single-cut type form a leafy 
<br>rosette growth in the first year and produce no 
<br>flowering stems.  Double–cut types produce many 
<br>flowering plants in the seedling year.  Mammoth 
<br>(single-cut) red clover matures later than medium 
<br>types; only one crop of mammoth red clover is 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">harvested each season since recovery is slow. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Adaptation and Distribution 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Red clover grows best on well-drained loamy soils, 
<br>but it will also grow on soil that is not as well-
<br>drained.  Medium and fine textured soils are 
<br>preferred by the plant over sandy or gravelly soils.  It 
<br>is best adapted to a pH of 6.0 or higher but will grow 
<br>on moderately acid soils. It is important to note that 
<br>Mammoth (single-cut) red clover is generally 
<br>recommended for areas with a short growing season. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Red clover is distributed throughout the United States 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">and is best adapted where summer temperatures are 
<br>moderately cool to warm and moisture is sufficient

<br>precipitation 25 inches or more) or if site is irrigated.   
<br>Data indicate that as much as 10 million acres of red 
<br>clover were grown in the Northern states in the 
<br>1940’s.  Its prominence has waned because it does 
<br>not fit well into currently used crop rotations. Red 
<br>Clover was grown extensively in the northeast and 
<br>northwest U.S. and used as a winter annual in the 
<br>southeastern U.S.  For a current distribution map, 
<br>please consult the Plant Profile page for this species 
<br>on the PLANTS Website. 
<br> 
<br>Red clover originated in Asia Minor and southeastern 
<br>Europe and was introduced to the British Isles from 
<br>Germany in the 1600’s.  English colonists brought 
<br>red clover to North America. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Establishment 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Red clover has approximately 275,000 seeds per 
<br>pound.  The full seeding rate is 6 pounds PLS per 
<br>acre for a solid stand.  The recommended seeding 
<br>rate for a grass/legume pasture is approximately 25 
<br>percent or 1.5 pounds PLS per acre.  For pasture 
<br>establishment, seed should be drilled into a well-
<br>prepared seedbed that has been plowed, harrowed, 
<br>and compacted to produce a very firm seedbed.  The 
<br>seed should be inoculated with the correct </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Rhizobium</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br>before seeding.  Seeding depth should be 1/8 - 1/4 
<br>inch deep.  Typically, in grass/legume mixtures, the 
<br>grass is drill seeded in rows and red clover is over 
<br>seeded to limit competition from grass.  For 
<br>stabilization use, seed is broadcast on roadside cuts 
<br>and fills by cyclone seeders, hydroseeders, or blower-
<br>type equipment. 
<br> 
<br>For solid stands for hay production, red clover is 
<br>usually planted with a small grain companion crop 
<br>such as oats, barley, flax, or winter wheat.  The 
<br>recommended seeding rate for small grain companion 
<br>crops are typically 50 to 75 % of normal.  Red clover 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">has good shade tolerance (approximately 6% of 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">daylight) which makes companion cropping with red 
<br>clover fairly successful.  Its tolerance to shade allows 
<br>red clover to be used as a cover crop under corn for 
<br>silage.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:71px; top:1491px; width:218px; height:82px;"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">The proper time of seeding is determined by seasonal 
<br>moisture conditions.  In most areas, this may vary 
<br>from early April to mid May.  Late summer and fall 
<br>seedings should only be conducted when site is 
<br>irrigated and when at least six weeks of growing 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">season remain to assure establishment before freezing 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">conditions.

<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Graze or cut for hay when the red clover is ¼- ½ 
<br>bloom.  A second cutting or successive grazing 
<br>should occur when red clover is ¼ bloom.  Leave at 
<br>least 2 inches of growth after each harvest.  
<br>Mammoth red clover does not produce flowers the 
<br>first year.  Typically, 2 hay harvests per year can be 
<br>made after establishment and because red clover is 
<br>short-lived will only be productive for about 3 years.  
<br>Red Clover can cause livestock to bloat, so care 
<br>should be taken to reduce this condition.  Keep pH 
<br>and fertility (especially phosphorus and potassium) at 
<br>the proper levels.  Control insects and diseases. 
<br> 
<br>If planted with a small grain as a companion crop, the 
<br>small grain should be removed before it can smother 
<br>the red clover. 
<br> 
<br>Red clover is normally used as a companion crop 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">with forage grasses (smooth brome, meadow brome, 
<br>timothy, ryegrass, tall fescue or orchardgrass) to 
<br>provide a source of nitrogen while also providing 
<br>high-yielding forage rich in protein. 
<br> 
<br>When seed is properly inoculated at time of planting, 
<br>red clover can fix nitrogen from N</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:8px">2</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> in the 
<br>atmosphere, requiring little or no additional nitrogen 
<br>fertilizer.  However, it responds to fertilizer and 
<br>requires relatively large amounts of phosphorus, 
<br>potassium, and sulphur in some areas.  In grass-
<br>legume mixtures, it is not possible to supply the ideal 
<br>combinations of elements for both grass and legume.  
<br>If nitrogen is applied to a grass-legume mixture, the 
<br>grass will tend to increase at the expense of the 
<br>legume.  Well-fertilized grass will outgrow clover in 
<br>fall and winter and could smother the clover. 
<br> 
<br>Red clover cut for hay at 50% bloom stage usually 
<br>exceeds 14-15 % protein.  Unfavorable quality results 
<br>when harvest is delayed and plants are allowed to 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">mature. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br>Management for forage is aimed at maintaining 40-
<br>50% clover.  Close grazing (2 inch stubble height) 
<br>favors clover, whereas light grazing favors grass.    
<br>Red clover should be rotationally grazed. 
<br> 
<br>Red clover has nearly the same potential to cause 
<br>bloat as alfalfa when grazed.  It usually is 
<br>recommended as a mixture with one or more grasses 
<br>for pasture which will greatly reduce the hazard for 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">bloat.  Livestock sometimes slobber excessively 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">when feeding on second cutting red clover hay.  This 
<br>is caused by a fungus, is harmless and rather rare.

<br>and provide early feed, but excessive rates are 
<br>detrimental to the clover stand.  Phosphate 
<br>applications are broadcast in fall or spring according 
<br>to soil tests.  Sulfur, boron, or magnesium may be 
<br>needed for maximum production on some soils in the 
<br>western part of red clover’s range. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Pests and Potential Problems 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Red Clover is subject to many disease and insect 
<br>problems.  Crown rot, root rot, anthracnose and 
<br>powdery mildew may be problems in areas with high 
<br>humidity and rainfall.  Viral diseases such as bean 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">yellow mosaic virus, stem blackening diseases and 
<br>black patch also occur. Choose disease resistant 
<br>cultivars to reduce the occurrence of these problems. 
<br> 
<br>Red clover is attacked by many insects including the 
<br>clover root borer, clover root curculio, clover seed 
<br>chalcid, clover weevils, aphids, midges, and leaf 
<br>hoppers.  Unfortunately, there is no practical overall 
<br>control of red clover insects especially in seed 
<br>production fields because of pollination by 
<br>bumblebees and honey bees.  Chemical control of 
<br>insect pests would also destroy the pollinators. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Environmental Concerns 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Red clover may be spread by seed and may be 
<br>considered weedy in some locations.  It can spread 
<br>into adjoining vegetative communities under ideal 
<br>climatic and environmental conditions. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Seed Production 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Plant red clover at 3-4 pounds PLS per acre in 12 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">inch rows.  Because seed production often follows 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">production for hay, row culture is not as critical as 
<br>with other plant materials grown for seed production. 
<br> 
<br>Average seed yields are about 350-500 pounds per 
<br>acre but can easily be doubled by using best 
<br>production practices.  Time and frequency of 
<br>irrigation is critical as red clover lodges easily.  
<br>Irrigation should be discontinued when the degree of 
<br>bloom and seedhead maturity is maximized.  Highest 
<br>yields result from second growth in two year old 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">fields.  The first growth is normally cut for hay.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br>Pollination by bumblebees or honey bees is critical.  
<br>Bumblebees are usually relied on for pollination but 
<br>are often low in number.  Provide at least one honey

<br>the field when 5-10 percent of the crop is in bloom.  
<br>If hives are placed too early, bees will tend to orient 
<br>to other legume fields in the vicinity.  The lack of 
<br>pollinating insects is often the biggest cause of low 
<br>seed yields. 
<br> 
<br>Seed is harvested when the interior of the heads are 
<br>brown, the stems show a yellowish tinge and the 
<br>seeds show color ranging from yellow to purple.  
<br>Harvesting seed before this stage results in light seed 
<br>with low germination.  If harvest is delayed beyond 
<br>this stage, heavy seed loss occurs from weathering 
<br>and harvesting operations. 
<br> 
<br>To obtain highest seed yields, red clover is usually 
<br>cut and windrowed for drying prior to combining.  
<br>Occasionally seed is harvested by direct combining 
<br>but yields and quality are usually low.
