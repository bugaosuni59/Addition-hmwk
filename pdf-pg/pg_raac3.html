<br>Description 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">General</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">:Tall buttercup is a perennial that grows from a 
<br>stout, abruptly ending root stock (praemorse). It has a 
<br>short, thick rhizome capable of splitting to form daughter 
<br>plants in clumps reaching about three feet (one meter) in 
<br>diameter. There are thick roots on the underside of the 
<br>rhizome and wiry, persistent fibers from the vascular 
<br>bundles of decayed leaf petioles on the upper side. 
<br>Axillary buds form on the rhizomes at the tightly spaced 
<br>nodes from which the basal leaves grow.   
<br> 
<br>Basal leaves grow directly from the rhizome or root 
<br>crown and have petioles up to eight inches in length. Leaf 
<br>blades are one to three inches long, are broadly 
<br>pentagonal in outline, but can also be ovate or heart-
<br>shaped. They are more or less deeply divided into three 
<br>palmate lobes that are each divided again two to three 
<br>times into acute segments. There can be 40 to 50 basal 
<br>leaves.   
<br> 
<br>Freely branching, erect flower stems are one to three feet 
<br>(30 to 100 centimeters) tall, and there may be one to 
<br>several stems per plant. Hairs on the stem are sparse to 
<br>copious, and soft and spreading or appressed to the stem. 
<br>Similar hairs are on the leaves, leaf petioles, and sepals. 
<br>The stem leaves resemble the basal leaves but are smaller, 
<br>alternate in arrangement along the stem and reduced 
<br>upward to three- to five-lobed bracts. The upper leaves 
<br>lack petioles.   
<br> 
<br>The regular flowers have radial symmetry and form on 
<br>the branch ends in cymose inflorescences. Flower 
<br>pedicels can be up to five inches long and are hairy. The 
<br>five floral sepals are bent downward (reflexed), about 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">one-quarter inch long, greenish, with long, soft, spreading 
<br>hairs. The sepals shed early during flowering. There are 
<br>usually five (but as many as eight) glossy petals which are 
<br>typically bright yellow, but may be pale yellow or white. 
<br>Each petal is approximately one-half inch long and 
<br>roundish in shape. There is a nectary about one millimeter 
<br>long at the base of the inner surface of the petal. Thirty to 
<br>70 stamens surround the 15 to 40 pistils that are on a 
<br>globe-shaped receptacle. The fruit is a small (two to three 
<br>millimeters long), dry walled achene containing a single 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">seed. Achenes are roundish, compressed, and smooth with 
<br>a prominent keel and a hooked beak at the tip.</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:15px">

<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">Life history: </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Tall buttercup is a true perennial, 
<br>reproducing by both rhizomes and seeds. In late winter 
<br>and early spring, 40 to 50 new leaves form rapidly at the 
<br>apex of elongating rhizomes. After basal leaf formation, 
<br>there is a leafy phase indicated by a delay between the 
<br>growth of the last leaf and the growth of the flowering 
<br>stem. Leaf area peaks at this time, and declines thereafter.   
<br> 
<br>Development of flower buds begins in late summer the 
<br>year before flowering and is promoted by low winter 
<br>temperatures. Flowering occurs in late spring, peaks in 
<br>early summer, and typically lasts two months. The 
<br>duration of flowering can be extended by high soil 
<br>moisture. In Norway, flowering continued into early 
<br>autumn, and in New Zealand flowering occurred all year. 
<br>Seed set begins in late summer and continues into 
<br>autumn. Cross pollination is required for seed production 
<br>because pollen is produced after the stigmata of the same 
<br>flower are receptive, thus seed set can be limited where 
<br>pollinators are lacking. The basal leaves begin to die at 
<br>flowering, and the flower stems die after flowering.   
<br> 
<br>When grown under cultivation, tall buttercup will flower 
<br>in the first year. However, naturally growing plants may 
<br>not flower until the second year or for up to 10 years. The 
<br>reproductive potential does not decline with age at least 
<br>up to 10 years. Flowering is reduced at high population 
<br>densities. Plants flowering late in the season are less 
<br>likely to flower the following year, most likely because of 
<br>insufficient accumulation of energy reserves needed to 
<br>flower. Tall buttercup generally has low fecundity, 
<br>typically producing less than four flowers per plant. The 
<br>exceptions are on sites with low species diversity or high 
<br>soil fertility. 
<br> 
<br>Seed survival rate in the soil is generally less than two 
<br>years. Seed bank studies indicate the proportional 
<br>contribution of tall buttercup to the soil seed bank mimics 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">its proportional contribution to the plant community. Seed 
<br>bank densities have been reported at three seeds per 
<br>square yard in Quebec, 300 seeds per square yard in 
<br>England, to 2,600 seeds per square yard in a dense 
<br>population in New Zealand. Most seeds accumulate in the 
<br>top inch (2.5 centimeters) of the soil and are lost mainly 
<br>through germination. Seeds buried deeper than one inch 
<br>can survive longer than two years. One study found 20% 
<br>of the seeds buried below 1.5 inches survived for 16 
<br>years, and another study found seeds in the top 1.2 inches 
<br>survived 10 years, even after tall buttercup had 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">disappeared from the plant community. 
<br> 
<br>The survival of plants produced from rhizomes is also 
<br>below one percent. There are variable reports on the 
<br>lifespan of tall buttercup ranging from four years on the 
<br>grasslands of Wales to 14 years in Russia.  
<br>

<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:323px; top:945px; width:235px; height:682px;"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">Response to Competition</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">: The growth and reproduction of 
<br>tall buttercup is reduced under plant competition. A field 
<br>study in Sweden found tall buttercup production was 
<br>greatly reduced when grown in species mixtures 
<br>suggesting diverse plant communities may competitively 
<br>suppress the weed. The investigators related this to the 
<br>relatively small stature of tall buttercup (i.e., the basal 
<br>leaves of tall buttercup were overtopped by taller growing 
<br>grasses such as orchardgrass – </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">Dactylis glomerata</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> and 
<br>reed canarygrass – </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">Phalaris arundinacea</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">). They also 
<br>noted that tall buttercup did not respond to increased 
<br>species richness by increasing its stature. However, it may 
<br>adapt to low-light intensities by increasing light-
<br>harvesting efficiencies under high-nitrogen conditions. 
<br>Population increase by rhizome reproduction is a strategy 
<br>of tall buttercup to reduce interspecific competition by 
<br>excluding other species within a colony of ramets. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">Habitat:</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:15px"> </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">In its native range, tall buttercup is common and 
<br>abundant in damp meadows and pastures on calcareous or 
<br>neutral substrata. On the British Isles it is frequently 
<br>found on rock ledges, gullies, and occasionally on 
<br>mountain top detritus at elevations of 4,000 feet. On 
<br>Dutch river flood plains, the habitat preference of tall 
<br>buttercup is the intermediate position on the elevational 
<br>gradient in a zone with approximately 30 days of flooding 
<br>per year. </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:15px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Bold; font-size:13px">Adaptation 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Tall buttercup can tolerate low-oxygen conditions created 
<br>by flooding for 30 days by the formation of air storage 
<br>aerenchyma cells in the roots. It is adapted to, and 
<br>invasive in, moist fields, meadows, pastures, and 
<br>grasslands, and in irrigated and sub-irrigated meadows. It 
<br>has also been found along rivers, streams, and lakes; in 
<br>borrow pits, along roads with gravely substrata, along 
<br>irrigation ditches, in parking lots and in gravel pits. It has 
<br>been collected from elevations as high as 8,400 feet 
<br>(2,500 meters). 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Bold; font-size:13px">Establishment 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Tall buttercup established both by seed and reproductive 
<br>rhizomes. Many tall buttercup seeds germinate within 
<br>their first year, but less than one percent of the seedlings 
<br>survive. Survival increases under disturbance that 
<br>removes neighboring vegetation. Both well-drained and 
<br>waterlogged soil conditions reduce seedling recruitment. 
<br> 
<br>Rhizomes reproduce after flowering or removal of the 
<br>flowering stem by cutting, defoliation, disease, livestock 
<br>trampling, or other disturbances. Lateral buds on the 
<br>rhizomes are released from the apical dominance of the 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">main stem and grow to form new rhizomes that later 
<br>separate from the parent. New shoots re-impose apical 
<br>dominance over the remaining buds on the rhizome, 
<br>ensuring a continuous supply of buds capable of 
<br>regenerating new shoots. Regeneration from rhizomes is 
<br>reduced in species-rich plant communities.

<br>by the splitting of rhizomes and seeds dropping from 
<br>parent plants. Seeds have no mechanism for long distance 
<br>dispersal other than the short-hooked beak at the tip of the 
<br>achene which allows them to be carried long distances in 
<br>the pelts of animals. Seed can also be transported in soil 
<br>stuck to animal hooves, and when ingested, in the gut of 
<br>grazing animals. A large portion of seeds fed to cows 
<br>were still viable after being voided in dung, and one study 
<br>estimated one cow could disperse about 9,400 seeds 
<br>during a 165-day grazing season. Other long distance 
<br>dispersal mechanisms include contaminated hay, farm 
<br>equipment, water currents, clothing and shoes.

<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Bold; font-size:13px">Environmental Concerns 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Tall buttercup is usually avoided by livestock because of 
<br>the glycoside ranunculin, thereby reducing the grazing 
<br>capacities of pastures. When ingested, it causes blistering 
<br>of the lips and tongue, intestinal disorders, and ventricular 
<br>fibrillation and respiratory failure, which can be fatal. 
<br>Milk from dairy cattle that have eaten tall buttercup is 
<br>bitter. This flavor can persist in butter made from the 
<br>milk. Dense clones of tall buttercup crowd out native and 
<br>non-native pasture plants reducing forage capacity and 
<br>plant diversity. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Bold; font-size:13px"> 
<br>Control 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Please contact your local agricultural extension specialist 
<br>or county weed specialist to learn what works best in your 
<br>area and how to use it safely.  Always read label and 
<br>safety instructions for each control method. Trade names

<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">Herbicides:</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> Tall buttercup is listed on the Milestone® 
<br>(aminopyralid) and Clarity® (dicamba) herbicide labels. 
<br>Always check the herbicide label to confirm formulation 
<br>and proper usage of the product before applying. Always 
<br>follow label instructions to reduce toxicity or other 
<br>unintended risks to humans and the environment, and to 
<br>confirm potential grazing and re-planting restrictions. 
<br>Optimum timing for herbicide application is during the 
<br>leafy phase in late spring prior to flower-shoot growth. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">This is a period of active growth and the time of greatest 
<br>leaf area for herbicide absorption. Tall buttercup 
<br>populations resistant to the phenoxy herbicide MPCA 
<br>have been found in New Zealand. To avoid the 
<br>development of herbicide resistant populations, integrate 
<br>herbicidal control with other control methods and use 
<br>herbicides with different modes of action.

<br>the rootstock may be an effective method to temporally 
<br>reduce small-scale infestations and scattered plants, either 
<br>as new invaders or those persisting after herbicide 
<br>treatments. However, any rhizomes left in the soil will 
<br>regenerate into new plants and follow-up control will be 
<br>needed to target those plants and plants regenerating from 
<br>the soil seed bank. Pulling rosette and flowering plants 
<br>will reduce seed set.  
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">Mowing: </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Mowing timing and frequency for tall buttercup 
<br>management should promote competitiveness of desirable 
<br>pasture plants and reduce tall buttercup flowering. For 
<br>example, in red fescue dominated dry valley meadows in 
<br>Russia, mowing reduced flowering of tall buttercup. 
<br>Frequent mowing reduced the occurrence of tall buttercup 
<br>in meadows and grasslands in Europe. However, frequent 
<br>cuttings in Slovenia reduced the competitiveness of 
<br>tussock grasses and enabled tall buttercup encroachment. 
<br> 
<br>Tilling: Rhizomes and seeds of tall buttercup can 
<br>regenerate populations after tillage. The disturbance of 
<br>tillage can create a favorable environment for tall 
<br>buttercup growth and reproduction by reducing 
<br>competitive perennial plants. Therefore, tillage has the 
<br>potential to spread tall buttercup and is not recommended 
<br>unless integrated with herbicide management and 
<br>followed by revegetation with desired, competitive plants. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">Fertilization: </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Fertilizer applications to deteriorated 
<br>pastures in Austria had little effect on the abundance of 
<br>tall buttercup. However, other studies in Europe showed 
<br>applications of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium 
<br>reduced the relative abundance of tall buttercup by 
<br>increasing the proportion of palatable grasses. These 
<br>contradictory results indicate there may be a trade-off 
<br>between competitive suppression of tall buttercup and its 
<br>ability to compensate for reduced light levels resulting 
<br>from overtopping competitors. On cultivated pastures and 
<br>hay meadows, nutrient management is important to 
<br>maintaining the competitiveness of desired perennial 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">grasses, but management of the competing plants to 
<br>optimize their vigor is equally important. Nutrient 
<br>management combined with judicious use of herbicides 
<br>and crop rotation is recommended where tall buttercup 
<br>invades non-native pastures and hay meadows. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">Grazing Management: </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Several studies suggest that tall 
<br>buttercup increases with grazing. In northern Finland, tall 
<br>buttercup increased when sheep were introduced into 
<br>abandoned semi-natural grasslands. In Iceland, tall 
<br>buttercup increased in fields that were grazed in the 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">spring. In Britain, tall buttercup increased in abundance 
<br>with pasture age, cropping for hay, and with overgrazing. 
<br>In these studies, litter removal, exposure of bare ground, 
<br>and suppression of competitive grasses were believed to 
<br>facilitate the increase of tall buttercup. However, in New 
<br>Zealand, tall buttercup was less prevalent in sheep

<br>of the different management systems on other competitive 
<br>pasture plants.   
<br> 
<br>Tall buttercup contains the glycoside ranunculin which 
<br>deters grazing by livestock and, when ingested, causes 
<br>potentially fatal disorders. Further studies are needed to 
<br>determine the feasibility of using sheep or goats to control 
<br>tall buttercup. However, prescribed grazing to promote 
<br>the competitiveness of desirable pasture forage plants will 
<br>prevent tall buttercup invasion and re-invasion after weed 
<br>control. Spring grazing is not recommended because it is 
<br>likely to favor tall buttercup by removing the shading 
<br>canopy of competitive plants when tall buttercup leaf area 
<br>is greatest. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">Biological Control: </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Tall buttercup is host to insects in its 
<br>native range that may contribute to its population 
<br>regulation. However, at this time, there are no insects 
<br>available as biological control agents in North America. 
<br>Tall buttercup is host to the naturally occurring soil 
<br>fungus, </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">. A New Zealand study 
<br>found one virulent isolate of </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">Sclerotinia</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> temporarily 
<br>reduced tall buttercup total dry weight by 57 percent, 
<br>suggesting this pathogen may reduce the invasiveness of 
<br>this weed. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">Integrated Pest Management (IPM): </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Tall buttercup is 
<br>predominantly a weed problem on moist hay meadows 
<br>and pastures. For severe infestations, the goal of 
<br>integrated weed management is to increase the time 
<br>intervals between initial herbicidal control and subsequent 
<br>reapplications. This is best accomplished by encouraging 
<br>a diverse plant community with a strong component of 
<br>grasses with tall stature. Prescribed grazing to maintain 
<br>vigorous grasses is fundamental and spring grazing is 
<br>discouraged to ensure a shading canopy when tall 
<br>buttercup leaf area peaks. On decadent meadows and 
<br>pastures, apply crop rotation to provide weed control and 
<br>to re-establish vigorous grass and legume hay and pasture 
<br>species. On irrigated pastures and hay meadows, flooding 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">is discouraged as it will favor tall buttercup over less 
<br>flood-adapted grasses. Nutrient management should avoid 
<br>over application of nutrients as high nutrients may 
<br>facilitate the adaptation of tall buttercup to photosynthesis 
<br>under low-light conditions of a shading canopy. Persistent 
<br>hand pulling and grubbing of rhizomes may be substituted 
<br>for herbicide application on small patches.
