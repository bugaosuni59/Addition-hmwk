<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Bold; font-size:13px">Description 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size:13px">Tansy ragwort is a winter annual, biennial, or short-lived 
<br>perennial commonly growing between 8-36 inches (20-80 
<br>centimeters) tall, but sometimes to heights greater than 6 
<br>feet (175-200 centimeters) under optimal conditions.  
<br>Rigid stems grow singly or in groups from an upright 
<br>caudex with only the upper half of the stems branching at 
<br>the inflorescence.  Tansy ragwort additionally perennates 
<br>via fragments of the numerous (50-100/crown) soft, 
<br>fleshy roots that grow primarily horizontally and 
<br>penetrate the soil to a maximum depth of 12 inches (30 
<br>centimeters).  
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size:15px">  </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size:13px">  
<br>Rosettes, either seedling or root bud in origin, are formed 
<br>from distinctive stalked basal leaves  2.7-7.9 inches (7-20 
<br>centimeters) long, deeply and pinnately lobed with ovate, 
<br>obovate, or narrow coarsely-toothed segments.  Leaves 
<br>are either glabrous or with loose wooly down on the 
<br>underside, especially during early development.  Rosette 
<br>leaves generally die back at or before flowering.  Stem 
<br>leaves are deeply bi- or tri-pinnatifid, arranged alternately 
<br>on the stem and are reduced in size higher on the stem.  
<br>Middle and upper stem leaves lack a petiole and slightly 
<br>clasp the stem.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size:15px">  </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size:13px">  
<br>Bright yellow, showy flowers arise only on the pedicel 
<br>ends; outer pedicels are progressively longer than inner 
<br>pedicels and form flat- or round-topped, dense and 
<br>compact corymbs.  Capitula 12-25 millimeters in diameter 
<br>and numbering 20-60 per corymb have 13 dark-tipped 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size:13px">bracts 3-4 millimeters long, and are composed of both ray 
<br>and disc florets.  There are 13 achene producing ray 
<br>florets with rays 8-2 millimeters long.  Disc florets are 
<br>numerous and produce both pollen and achenes.  The 
<br>number of capitula and achenes produced per plant is 
<br>highly variable. 
<br> 
<br>Single seeds are contained within each achene; achenes 
<br>produced from ray florets shed their pappus, are glabrous, 
<br>and have a thick pericarp, whereas achenes produced 
<br>from disc florets retain their pappus, are pubescent with 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size:13px">short hairs (trichomes) along prominent ribs and are 
<br>lighter in weight than ray achenes.  The pappus, 
<br>composed of numerous white 'hairs' 6 millimeters in 
<br>length, is attached to the</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size:15px"> </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size:13px">top of the achene; its

<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,BoldItalic; font-size:13px">Habitat 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size:13px">Tansy ragwort tolerates a wide range of habitats and 
<br>environmental conditions but is generally found on mesic 
<br>sites with commonly cool, wet, cloudy weather.  It grows 
<br>on many soil types but usually on lighter, well-drained 
<br>loamy to sandy soils.  It normally does not grow where 
<br>there is a high water table or on highly acidic soils.  In 
<br>Europe it naturally occurs in sand dune, woodland, and 
<br>grassland communities.  In North America it is found in 
<br>pastures, forest clearings, and waste places and is often 
<br>associated with Canada thistle (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">Cirsium arvense</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size:13px">), 
<br>common St. Johnswort (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">Hypericum perforatum</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size:13px">) and 
<br>yellow toadflax (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">Linaria vulgaris</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size:13px">).   
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,BoldItalic; font-size:13px">Life History 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size:13px">Tansy ragwort is typically a biennial plant: it reproduces 
<br>for the most part by seed; it overwinters in the seed or 
<br>rosette stage; and it passes through the first growing 
<br>season in the vegetative rosette stage before becoming 
<br>reproductively mature.  However, because both the root 
<br>and the caudex of this species have the capacity to form 
<br>perennating buds under environmental or mechanical 
<br>stress, tansy ragwort has the vegetative regenerative 
<br>capacity of a perennial.  A study of 179 plants in Australia 
<br>found 2% were annuals, 45% biennials, and 39% were 
<br>perennials.  A separate study in England found 8% of the 
<br>plants were annuals, 39% were biennials, and 53% were 
<br>perennials.  Tansy ragwort has been observed as a true 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size:13px">perennial by continuing to grow after flowering, 
<br>particularly after disturbance.  An Oregon study reported 
<br>20% of the tansy ragwort plants in a population were true 
<br>perennials.   
<br> 
<br>Tansy ragwort has four distinct life history stages: seeds, 
<br>seedlings, rosettes, and flowering plants.  The viability of 
<br>a tansy ragwort seed crop is about 80%.  The seeds have 
<br>no mechanisms of innate dormancy other than the 
<br>relatively thick pericarp on ray floret achenes which is 
<br>believed to delay germination by a  
<br>few days.  The maximum potential for germination is 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size:13px">reached when achenes leave the flowerhead: however, 
<br>experimentation showed this potential did not 
<br>significantly decrease after three years of storage under 
<br>field conditions.  Most seed germinates in the late summer 
<br>or early autumn, but seeds lying dormant throughout the 
<br>winter will germinate at the beginning of the growing

<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:323px; top:945px; width:235px; height:679px;"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size:13px">season in the spring.  Ideal temperatures for germination 
<br>range between 41-86</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size:8px">o</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size:13px"> F (5-30</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size:8px">o</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size:13px"> C).  Soil moisture 
<br>influences germination: at any given temperature an 
<br>increase in soil moisture increases germination and the 
<br>optimum temperature for germination changes as soil 
<br>moisture changes.  Vegetative cover may inhibit 
<br>germination and frost, drought, or burial may induce 
<br>dormancy.  Seed buried in soil deeper than 0.75 inch (2 
<br>centimeters) remain dormant.  Light is required for 
<br>germination.  Studies showed 24% of seeds buried for six 
<br>years maintained their viability.  Also, seeds buried up to 
<br>2 centimeters deep had a higher germination rate than 
<br>seeds left on the soil surface, most likely because 
<br>moisture is consistently greater below the soil surface 
<br>than on the surface.  Seeds subjected to drought or cold 
<br>temperature shock had delayed germination; the longer 
<br>the shock, the longer the delay.  
<br>  
<br>Seedling establishment and survival are variable, the 
<br>largest determinant of survival being the amount of 
<br>vegetative cover.  In experimental garden plots two 
<br>months after seeding tansy ragwort, no seedlings survived 
<br>in plots with long grass or in plots with short but 
<br>continuous turf, whereas seedling survival was greater in 
<br>cleared or forest land areas than grassy areas.  Grazed 
<br>pastures on Prince Edward Island, Canada, had about 
<br>eight times more tansy ragwort plants than non-grazed 
<br>pastures.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size:15px">  </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size:13px">  
<br>Once established, seedlings form flattened rosettes that 
<br>are effective competitors.  The large rosette leaves are 
<br>able to cover neighboring plants thereby suppressing their 
<br>growth.  When the rosette leaves die, sites are opened for 
<br>tansy ragwort seed germination.  One study found 
<br>seedling establishment was over four times higher on sites 
<br>opened by dying rosettes than on sites in surrounding 
<br>vegetation.  Alkaloids produced by rosettes may have the 
<br>allelopathic effect of suppressing other plants.  Rosette 
<br>leaves die when plants flower.  
<br>  
<br>Plants typically flower during the second year of growth.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size:13px">Flowering has been reported to begin as early as June and 
<br>to last as late as mid-November.  It is believed rosettes 
<br>must achieve some minimum size before flowering can 
<br>begin, and the probability of flowering increases as 
<br>rosette size increases.  Floral expansion is rapid and 
<br>florets are receptive to pollination as soon as the floret is 
<br>fully expanded.  Hymenopteran (bee/wasp) and dipteran 
<br>(fly) insect species are the primary pollinators of tansy 
<br>ragwort. Seed disperses throughout the fall. Rosettes that 
<br>do not flower continue to grow into the fall accumulating 
<br>storage carbohydrate important for winter survival. 
<br>Carbohydrate content of the plant is highest going into

<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size:13px">Tansy ragwort can reduce forage yields by as much as 
<br>50% in pastures. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids are present in all 
<br>plant parts. Cattle, deer, horses and goats consuming 
<br>either growing plants or tansy ragwort in silage and hay 
<br>store these alkaloids in their liver. Even if symptoms are 
<br>not evident or are minor in nature, the cumulative storage 
<br>of alkaloids can result in reduced weight gain, liver 
<br>degradation, reduced butterfat content of milk, and 
<br>sudden death in apparently healthy animals. Alkaloids in 
<br>tansy ragwort pollen also taint honey, making it bitter, 
<br>off-color and unmarketable.

<br> 
<br>Tansy ragwort can be controlled using auxinic herbicides 
<br>(mimics of auxin, a naturally-occurring plant growth 
<br>regulator). The best timing of application is when tansy 
<br>ragwort is actively growing in the rosette stage either in 
<br>the spring or mid-fall. Herbicides are less effective after 
<br>plants have bolted to produce flowers. In most cases 
<br>reapplication of herbicide or integration with other control 
<br>methods will be required for sustained population 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size:13px">reductions. The amine, low-volatile ester, or emulsifiable 
<br>acid formulations of 2,4-D are effective when applied at 
<br>two pounds acid equivalent per acre. Always check the 
<br>herbicide label to confirm formulation and proper  
<br>use of the product before applying. When using four 
<br>pounds acid equivalent per gallon formulation, apply the 
<br>mixed product at a rate of two quarts per acre.  
<br> 
<br>Tansy ragwort is listed on the following herbicide labels 
<br>at rates in parentheses: picloram (1-2 qt./ac.), 
<br>aminopyralid (5-7 oz./ac.), metsulfuron (0.5-1 oz./ac. with 
<br>nonionic surfactant at 0.5%), and chlorsulfuron (1-3 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size:13px">oz./ac. with nonionic surfactant at 0.5% volume to 
<br>volume). Metsulfuron and chlorsulfuron should not be 
<br>applied where soil pH is greater than 7.9 because under 
<br>these conditions chemical breakdown is slow resulting in 
<br>extended residual activity that increases the risk of off-site 
<br>movement of the chemical and non-target plant injury.

<br> 
<br>Herbicides are most effective where competitive desired 
<br>plants are present to fill voids in the plant community 
<br>following successful tansy ragwort control. However, 
<br>herbicide injury to non-target desirable broadleaved plants 
<br>and some grasses should be expected; consult product 
<br>labels for further information on potential non-target 
<br>injury. To avoid non-target injury, apply herbicides in the 
<br>fall after desired plants are dormant for the winter. This 
<br>tactic is most effective when using herbicides with low 
<br>residual activity. Always follow label instructions to 
<br>reduce toxicity or other unintended risks to humans and 
<br>the environment, and to confirm potential grazing and 
<br>replanting restrictions. Herbicide treatments typically 
<br>increase the concentration of water-soluble carbohydrate 
<br>in tansy ragwort, making it more palatable to livestock 
<br>and thereby increasing the risk of alkaloid poisoning. 
<br>Grazing should therefore be deferred for 3-4 weeks after 
<br>herbicide application.  
<br> 
<br>Hand pulling and digging that extracts all of the caudex 
<br>and fleshy rootstock is an effective method to temporally 
<br>reduce tansy ragwort on small-scale infestations and 
<br>scattered plants either as new invaders or those persisting 
<br>after herbicide treatments. Pulling rosette and flowering 
<br>plants will reduce seed set. Follow-up management will 
<br>be needed to eliminate plants regenerating from root 
<br>fragments or seed. Protective gloves are recommended to 
<br>be worn as a precautionary measure by anyone handling 
<br>tansy ragwort.  
<br> 
<br>Mowing is not an effective control for tansy ragwort. 
<br>Rosettes are flat to the ground and may be missed by the 
<br>mower blade, and when clipped, vegetative reproduction 
<br>is stimulated. Mowing when plants bolt to flower may 
<br>temporarily reduce seed production;</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size:15px"> </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size:13px">however, plants will 
<br>survive to flower again. A dispersal study found achenes 
<br>dispersed as much as two and a half times farther on 
<br>mowed sites than where the natural vegetation remained. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size:13px">However, in Switzerland, frequent mowing promoted 
<br>fast-growing grass species and was associated with 
<br>reduced occurrence of tansy ragwort. Mowing to maintain 
<br>vigorous grassland communities may help prevent tansy 
<br>ragwort invasion.  
<br> 
<br>The roots and caudex of tansy ragwort have the ability to 
<br>regenerate after they are broken by tilling. Therefore, 
<br>tillage has the potential to spread tansy ragwort and is not 
<br>recommended by itself. The disturbance of tillage can 
<br>create a favorable environment for tansy ragwort growth 
<br>and reproduction by reducing competitive perennial 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size:13px">plants. Tillage should be combined with herbicide 
<br>management and followed by revegetation with desired, 
<br>competitive plants.  
<br>Tansy ragwort thrives under mesic conditions and 
<br>therefore irrigation is not recommended as a control by 
<br>itself. Where tansy ragwort invades irrigated pastures and

<br>stimulate the competitiveness of the forage crop and when 
<br>combined with nutrient, forage harvest, and grazing 
<br>management practices and will help prevent the re-
<br>establishment of tansy ragwort after other control 
<br>practices are applied.  
<br> 
<br>Tansy ragwort is found on pastures of low to moderate 
<br>nutrient status in Switzerland, which is part of its native 
<br>range. A Swiss study found the amount of plant-available 
<br>nitrogen was one of the most important factors predicting 
<br>the occurrence of tansy ragwort. The model developed 
<br>from that study predicted a fivefold reduction in the risk 
<br>of tansy ragwort occurrence by doubling the application 
<br>of nitrogen from about 50 lb./ac. to 100 lb./ac. On 
<br>cultivated pasture and hay meadows, nutrient 
<br>management is important to maintaining the 
<br>competitiveness of desired perennial grasses. Nutrient 
<br>management combined with judicious use of herbicides 
<br>and crop rotation is recommended where tansy ragwort 
<br>invades non-native pastures and hay meadows.  
<br> 
<br>Fire is reportedly effective in killing reproductive tansy 
<br>ragwort plants and achenes. Fire is also sometimes used to 
<br>maintain the vigor and density of grassland communities 
<br>by burning excess plant litter and possibly increasing soil 
<br>fertility. Fire can therefore be used as a preventative 
<br>measure or in combination with other control methods to 
<br>reduce tansy ragwort populations. On forested sites and  
<br>clearings, the disturbance caused by fire may create 
<br>openings favorable to tansy ragwort invasion.  
<br> 
<br>The way grazing is managed is an important factor 
<br>influencing localized presence and distribution of tansy 
<br>ragwort in its native range. In a Swiss study continuously 
<br>grazed pasture was 11 times more likely to be infested by 
<br>tansy ragwort than pasture managed under rotational 
<br>grazing because the former management regime resulted 
<br>in more openings in the grass canopy where tansy ragwort 
<br>could establish. Pasture with greater than 25% uncovered 
<br>soil had a 40-fold greater risk of tansy ragwort occurrence 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size:13px">than pasture with less than 25% bare ground. Prescribed 
<br>grazing that maintains a continuous grassland community 
<br>is recommended both for the prevention of tansy ragwort 
<br>invasion and in pastures where it is already being 
<br>controlled.  
<br> 
<br>Tansy ragwort leaves and flowers exceed the standard 
<br>protein and digestibility requirements for sheep. In 
<br>addition, sheep seem to be immune to the plant’s toxic 
<br>alkaloids, and are willing grazers of young plants. In New 
<br>Zealand, intensive sheep grazing is the predominant 
<br>management approach for tansy ragwort; the weed 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size:13px">generally does not occur where sheep are regularly 
<br>stocked. In an Oregon grazing study, tansy ragwort seed 
<br>production was prevented and plant mortality was 
<br>attributed to sheep grazing in the summer following cattle 
<br>grazing in the spring. A separate study found tansy 
<br>ragwort plants subjected to 75% defoliation were able to

<br>Richardson’s fescue (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">Festuca rubra</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size:13px">), there was no re-
<br>growth after 75% defoliation. These studies suggest sheep 
<br>grazing is effective in controlling tansy ragwort where it 
<br>grows in a competitive grassland community.  
<br> 
<br>Biological control of tansy ragwort in the U.S. was 
<br>initiated in 1959 with the California release of the 
<br>cinnabar moth, </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">Tyria jacobaeae </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size:13px">L. (Lepidoptera: 
<br>Arctiidae). This agent is now well-established in 
<br>California, Oregon, Washington, northern Idaho and 
<br>northwestern Montana. The cinnabar moth flourishes in 
<br>lower elevation (below 3,000 feet/900 meters) open 
<br>canopy areas with warm, sunny summers and large, high-
<br>density infestations of tansy ragwort. Adult moths are 
<br>0.60-0.88 inch (15-22 millimeters) long with a wingspan 
<br>of 1.08-1.40 inches (27-35 millimeters) and have a 
<br>distinctive appearance: the black forewing is marked by a 
<br>few irregularly-shaped crimson spots and a crimson line 
<br>along the outer edge of the wing while the hind wing is 
<br>entirely crimson.

<br>Cinnabar moths typically emerge by late spring, mate and

<br>roused into flight during daylight hours when host 
<br>vegetation is disturbed. Eggs are laid on the underside of 
<br>rosette leaves in small groups. The eggs hatch after 
<br>several weeks’ development and emerging larvae begin 
<br>feeding on foliage closest to the hatch site. The damaging 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size:13px">larval stage of this agent is easily recognized by its 
<br>alternating bands of bright orange and black. Pupation 
<br>begins in late summer when the fully-grown fifth-instar 
<br>larvae seek out suitable sites in debris or soil, or under 
<br>bark; the cinnabar moth overwinters as a 0.80-1.00 inch 
<br>(20-25 millimeters) long dark reddish-brown pupa.

<br>lead to significant reductions in seed production and stand 
<br>density, although impact varies considerably. The larval 
<br>stage of this agent is optimal for redistribution onto 
<br>uncolonized populations of tansy ragwort. Caterpillars are 
<br>easily collected by shaking plants over collecting pans 
<br>(such as kitty litter trays); retain larvae under cool, dry 
<br>and uncrowded conditions in ventilated (with pin holes) 
<br>containers provisioned with fresh host plant material for
