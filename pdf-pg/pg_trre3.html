<br>originated in Europe and has become one of the most 
<br>widely distributed legumes in the world.  It generally has 
<br>a prostrate, stoloniferous growth habit.  The leaves are 
<br>composed of three leaflets, which may or may not have a 
<br>“crescent” or “water mark” on the upper surface.  Leaves 
<br>and roots develop along stolons at nodes.   
<br> 
<br>The flower heads, each consisting of 40 to 100 florets, are 
<br>borne on long stalks from the leaf axils.  Florets are white 
<br>but may have a pink hue.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: ABCDEE+Times,Bold; font-size:8px"> 
<br>Adaptation and Distribution </span><span style="font-family: ABCDEE+Times; font-size:9px"> 
<br>White clover thrives best in a cool, moist climate in soils 
<br>with ample lime, phosphate, and potash.  In general, white 
<br>clover is best adapted to clay and silt soils in humid and 
<br>irrigated areas.  It grows successfully on sandy soils with 
<br>a high water table or irrigated droughty soils when 
<br>adequately fertilized.  White clover seldom roots deeper 
<br></span><span style="font-family: ABCDEE+Times; font-size:9px">than 2 feet, which makes it adapted to shallow soils when 
<br>adequate moisture is available.  Dry soils limit 
<br>establishment and persistence of white clover.  Lack of 
<br>winter hardiness also limits the use of white clover in 
<br>areas that have cold winters and lack of snow cover.   
<br> 
<br>White clover has a circumboreal distribution.  It was 
<br>introduced to North America from Europe and has 
<br>naturalized throughout Canada and the United States, 
<br>including Hawaii and Alaska.  For a current distribution 
<br>map, consult the Plant Profile page for this species on the

<br></span><span style="font-family: ABCDEE+Times,Italic; font-size:9px">Forage</span><span style="font-family: ABCDEE+Times; font-size:9px">: White clover is one of the most important pasture 
<br>legumes.  It is highly palatable and nutritious forage for 
<br>all classes of livestock and most wildlife. White clover is 
<br>commonly planted with orchardgrass, ryegrass, 
<br>bromegrass, or tall fescue.  „Ladino‟ white clover planted 
<br>with orchardgrass produces the premier forage 
<br>combination for intensive grazing systems in the 
<br>Northeast.  „Ladino‟ grows tall enough to be harvested for 
<br>hay, silage, and green chop.  Common white clover 
<br>seldom grows tall enough to be harvested for hay or 
<br>silage.     
<br></span><span style="font-family: ABCDEE+Times,Italic; font-size:9px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: ABCDEE+Times,Italic; font-size:9px">Beautification</span><span style="font-family: ABCDEE+Times; font-size:9px">: White clover is seeded at 2 pounds per 
<br>acre with grass for stabilization on moist soils.  On dry 
<br>sites it usually establishes only on wet or moist areas.   
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: ABCDEE+Times,Italic; font-size:9px">Wildlife</span><span style="font-family: ABCDEE+Times; font-size:9px">: White clover is an excellent forage plant for 
<br>wildlife.  Leaves are grazed by white-footed voles, bears, 
<br>moose, mule and white-tailed deer and blue grouse.  
<br>Seeds are eaten by northern bobwhite, bufflehead, 
<br>American coot, sage grouse, ruffed grouse, sharp-tailed 
<br>grouse, horned lark, mallard, gray partridge, greater 
<br>prairie chicken, willow ptarmigan, American pintail, 
<br></span><span style="font-family: ABCDEE+Times; font-size:9px">California quail and American robin.   
<br></span><span style="font-family: ABCDEE+Times,Italic; font-size:9px"> 
<br>Erosion control</span><span style="font-family: ABCDEE+Times; font-size:9px">: Grass seedings benefit from the nitrogen 
<br>produced by white clover included in the seed mixture.  
<br>Solid stands of white clover form a good erosion control 
<br>cover on moist fertile soils, but stands may be sparse or 
<br></span><span style="font-family: ABCDEE+Times; font-size:9px">spotty on dry sites.

<div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:54px; top:948px; width:235px; height:664px;"><span style="font-family: ABCDEE+Times; font-size:9px">per acre.  For pasture establishment, seed is drilled into a 
<br>well-prepared seedbed that has been plowed, harrowed, 
<br>and compacted to produce a firm seedbed.  The seed 
<br>should be inoculated with the correct </span><span style="font-family: ABCDEE+Times,Italic; font-size:9px">Rhizobium</span><span style="font-family: ABCDEE+Times; font-size:9px"> before 
<br>seeding.  Seeding depth should be 1/8 - 1/4 inch deep.  
<br>Typically, in grass/legume mixtures, the grass is drill 
<br>seeded in rows and white clover is over seeded to limit 
<br>competition from grass.  For stabilization use, seed is 
<br>broadcast on roadside cuts and fills by cyclone seeders, 
<br>hydroseeders, or blower-type equipment.   
<br> 
<br>The proper time of seeding is determined by seasonal and 
<br>moisture conditions.  In most areas, this may vary from 
<br>early April to mid May.  Late summer and fall seedings 
<br>should only be conducted when site is irrigated and when 
<br>at least six weeks of growing season remain to assure 
<br>establishment before freezing conditions.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: ABCDEE+Times,Bold; font-size:8px"> 
<br>Management </span><span style="font-family: ABCDEE+Times; font-size:9px">White clover is normally used as a 
<br>companion crop with forage grasses (smooth brome, 
<br></span><span style="font-family: ABCDEE+Times; font-size:9px">meadow brome, timothy, ryegrass or orchardgrass) to 
<br>provide a source of nitrogen while also providing high-
<br>yielding forage rich in protein.  In the southeastern United 
<br>States, grass forages grown with white clover average as 
<br>high or higher than grass (by itself) fertilized at nitrogen 
<br>rates up to 300 pounds per acre.  Including white clover in 
<br>a grass forage mix also increases the calcium 
<br>concentration of the forage compared to grass alone.   
<br> 
<br>When seed is properly inoculated at time of planting, 
<br>white clover can fix nitrogen from N</span><span style="font-family: ABCDEE+Times; font-size:5px">2</span><span style="font-family: ABCDEE+Times; font-size:9px"> in the atmosphere, 
<br>requiring little or no additional nitrogen fertilizer.  
<br>However, it requires relatively large amounts of 
<br>phosphorus, potassium and sulphur, and will respond to 
<br>these fertilizer applications.  In grass-legume mixtures, it 
<br>is not possible to supply the ideal combinations of 
<br>elements for both grass and legume.  If nitrogen is applied 
<br>to a grass-legume mixture, the grass will tend to increase 
<br>at the expense of the  
<br>legume.  Well-fertilized grass will outgrow clover in fall 
<br>and winter and could smother the clover.   
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: ABCDEE+Times; font-size:9px">Management for forage is aimed at maintaining 40% to 
<br>50% clover.  Close grazing (2 inch stubble height) favors 
<br>clover, whereas light grazing favors grass.    White clover 
<br>should be rotationally grazed.  In order to use white 
<br>clover as a protein and energy supplement on small 
<br>acreages, livestock should be allowed to graze only 1 to 2 
<br>hours each day.  This will allow for optimum utilization 
<br>of the white clover pasture.  In a continuous grazing 
<br>system, graze white clover when it reaches 6 inches and 
<br>to a minimum of 2 inches at intervals of 15-30 days.   
<br> 
<br>White clover has medium to high bloat potential when 
<br>grazed.  It usually is recommended as a mixture with one 
<br>or more grasses for pasture.  Crude protein ranges from 
<br>12 to 23%, acid detergent fiber from 24 to 32% and total 
<br>digestible nutrients from 70 to 80% depending on the

<br> 
<br>Spring applications of nitrogen will stimulate grass and 
<br>provide early feed, but excessive rates are detrimental to 
<br>the clover stand.  Phosphate applications are broadcast in 
<br>fall or spring according to soil tests.  Sulfur, boron, or 
<br>magnesium may be needed for maximum production on 
<br>some soils in the western part of white clover‟s range. </span><span style="font-family: ABCDEE+Times; font-size:10px">  
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: ABCDEE+Times,Bold; font-size:8px">Pests and Potential Problems </span><span style="font-family: ABCDEE+Times; font-size:9px">Disease and insect pests of 
<br>white clover vary with the location, cultural practices and 
<br>use of white clover and vary among and during the 
<br>growing season.  White clover is susceptible to leaf 
<br>diseases, root and stolon diseases, nematodes, viral 
<br>diseases, insects, spider mites and slugs.  Practical control 
<br>of many plant diseases can be accomplished by harvesting 
<br>to remove disease inoculum and planting disease resistant 
<br>cultivars.  Judicious grazing management combined with 
<br></span><span style="font-family: ABCDEE+Times; font-size:9px">chemical control can limit damage from insects, spider 
<br>mites and slugs. </span><span style="font-family: ABCDEE+Times; font-size:10px">  
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: ABCDEE+Times,Bold; font-size:8px">Environmental Concerns </span><span style="font-family: ABCDEE+Times; font-size:9px">White clover spreads by both 
<br>seed and stolons and is considered weedy in some 
<br>locations.  It can spread into adjoining vegetative 
<br>communities under ideal climatic and environmental 
<br>conditions.   
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: ABCDEE+Times,Bold; font-size:8px">Seed Production  
<br></span><span style="font-family: ABCDEE+Times; font-size:9px">Plant white clover seed at 1 to 3 pounds PLS per acre in 
<br>20 to 24 inch rows.  To facilitate seed production and 
<br>between-row weed control, it is desirable to plant white 
<br>clover in spaced rows instead of solid stands. 
<br> 
<br>Most of the seed production of white clover occurs in 
<br>California. Average seed yields are about 300 pounds per 
<br>acre but yields can easily be doubled by using proper 
<br>production practices. Time and frequency of irrigation is 
<br>critical as white clover can lodge easily. Irrigation should 
<br>be stopped when the degree of bloom and seedhead 
<br>maturity is maximized. Honeybees are essential for seed 
<br>production. Hives should be placed at the rate of 7-24 
<br></span><span style="font-family: ABCDEE+Times; font-size:9px">hives per acre to maximize pollination and seed yield.  
<br> 
<br>Seed is usually harvested by swathing to allow the seed to 
<br>complete maturity and dry followed by combining. Spray 
<br>curing windrows with a chemical defoliant followed by 
<br>direct combining is also used and can be quite efficient.
