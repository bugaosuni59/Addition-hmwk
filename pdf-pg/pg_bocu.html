<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Description 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">General</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">: Side-oats grama is a deep rooted, perennial 
<br>grass. The plants crown will spread very slowly by 
<br>means of extremely short, stout rhizomes. A mid-
<br>grass in height, it has rather wide leaves and a very 
<br>distinct inflorescence consisting of a zigzag stalk 
<br>with small compressed spikes dangling from it at 
<br>even intervals. The short spikes dangle from one side 
<br>of the stalk, thus providing the plant with its common 
<br>name. In the vegetative state the grass is easily 
<br>recognized by the long, evenly spaced hairs attached 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">to the margins of the leaf near its base. Side-oats 
<br>grama possesses the C-4 photosynthetic pathway 
<br>common to warm-season grasses (Waller and Lewis, 
<br>1979).  
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Distribution</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">: For current distribution, please consult 
<br>the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
<br>PLANTS Web site. One of the most widely 
<br>distributed of the grama grasses. It has a widespread 
<br>distribution eastward from the Rocky Mountains to 
<br>near the east coast except in the southeast. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Habitat</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">: Side-oats grama grows effectively in the 
<br>dryer mid-grass prairie section of the Great Plains 
<br>that has an annual rainfall of 12-20 inches. This 
<br>species occurs naturally in mixed stands with blue 
<br>grama (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Bouteloua gracilis</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">) and little bluestem 
<br>(</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Schizachyrium</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">scoparium</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">).  This grass is better 
<br>adapted to calcareous and moderately alkaline soils 
<br>than to neutral or acidic soils (Leithead etal., 1971) 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Adaptation 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Side-oats is adapted to a broad range of sandy to 
<br>clayey textured soils; it is least tolerant of loose sands 
<br>and dense clays. The best stands of side-oats are 
<br>found on medium to fine texture upland soils. This 
<br>species has shown varying tolerance to soil salinity 
<br>from weak to moderate. Side-oats is moderately 
<br>drought tolerant, but less than blue grama. It is 
<br>moderately tolerant of semi-shaded conditions and 
<br>can be found in open woodlands. It will sustain 
<br>damage from wildfires when actively growing and 
<br>under drought stress conditions, but is fairly tolerant 
<br>of fire in a dormant state. It is also fairly tolerant of 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">spring flooding. It probably has the widest range of 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">adaptation of any of the warm-season perennial grass 
<br>plants. It grows in combination with tall warm-season

<br>nutritious forage that is relished by all classes of 
<br>livestock throughout the summer and fall, and it 
<br>remains moderately palatable into winter. This makes 
<br>it one of the most important range grass species. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Erosion Control: </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Weaver and Albertson (1944) 
<br>described the role of side-oats grama in the recovery 
<br>of grasslands following the drought of the 1930’s. It 
<br>was one of the few grasses that covered large areas 
<br>bared by the loss of other grasses during the drought 
<br>period. Side-oats grama is recommended in grass 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">mixtures for range and pasture seeding, for earth fill 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">and bank stabilization, for other critical areas and 
<br>recreational plantings. Successful seeding can be 
<br>obtained in rocky, stony or shallow soil sites. In fact 
<br>side-oats is often found in nearly pure stands on 
<br>caliche outcrops, stony hillsides and breaks (Harlan, 
<br>1954). 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Wildlife:</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> Side-oats provides some forage for antelope 
<br>and deer when actively growing.  Elk will use this 
<br>grass as forage throughout the year.  Leithead et al. 
<br>(1971) indicated that the seed of this species was 
<br>consumed by wild turkeys.

<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Establishment 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Seed improved cultivars of this grass no deeper than 
<br>¼ inch on fine textured soils and ¾ inch on coarser 
<br>textured soils. Planting with a grass seed drill on a 
<br>firm, weed free seedbed at the rate of 2.5 to 5.0 
<br>pounds of pure live seed (PLS) is encouraged. 
<br>Broadcasting at a higher seeding rate (50 to 100 
<br>percent increase) can be utilized on a previously 
<br>prepared seedbed that will be culti-packed after 
<br>seeding is completed. Increased seeding rate should 
<br>also be used on bare areas, harsh sites, or on areas 
<br>that require denser or quicker stand establishment. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Seeding is more likely to be successful if moisture 
<br>conditions are good and if mulch is used to retain 
<br>moisture on the seeding site. Most seed germinates 
<br>within 7 days under good field conditions. Seedling 
<br>vigor is good when compared to other warm season 
<br>grasses. Field germination, emergence and 
<br>establishment of this species are better than other 
<br>grama grasses. Protection from grazing is encouraged 
<br>while seedlings are in the juvenile stage of growth.  
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Management 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">As a mid-grass, side-oats grama is intermediate in 
<br>many respects between the tall and short grass 
<br>species. Side-oats grama is not as resistant to grazing  
<br>pressure as is blue grama due to its taller growth 
<br>habit. Side-oats seedlings are vigorous and stands 
<br>tend to establish quickly and can often be utilized for 
<br>forage production the second year after planting. 
<br>Side-oats grama is usually included in range mixes 
<br>and should be managed as native rangeland. 
<br>Management should include proper livestock 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">stocking rates and correct season of use.   
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Pests and Potential Problems 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Grasshoppers can be destructive of seedling stands. 
<br>Some stem and leaf rust occurs in wet years and 
<br>Mankin (1969) found several leaf spot and root rot 
<br>fungi occurred on side-oats grama.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br>Seeds and Plant Production 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Seed production experiments conducted in Nebraska 
<br>in the 1950’s found that side-oats grama response to 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">nitrogen fertilization was dependent on moisture 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">conditions during critical growth periods (Newell et 
<br>al., 1962). Seed yields measured as whole spikes 
<br>were substantially increased over unfertilized check 
<br>plots by all rates of nitrogen applied. Under drought 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:306px; top:925px; width:3px; height:15px;"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:15px"> 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:306px; top:1632px; width:3px; height:15px;"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:15px"> 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:323px; top:962px; width:217px; height:645px;"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">conditions the application of 60 and 90 pounds of 
<br>nitrogen yielded whole spike yields of approximately 
<br>equal amounts. Under favorable moisture conditions 
<br>nitrogen fertilization improved the quality of the 
<br>caryopsis by increased weight per 1000 caryopsis 
<br>over unfertilized plots. 
<br> 
<br>Seed of side-oats grama normally found on the open 
<br>market consists of either whole spikes or individual 
<br>florets, or mixtures of these, which vary widely in 
<br>their content of germinable caryopsis. Thus, seeding 
<br>rates of side-oats must be computed on the basis of 
<br>purity and viability of the seed lot. Purity analysis of 
<br>side-oats can be complicated by the inclusion of 
<br>adhering glumes and spike fragments as part of the 
<br>seed unit. As long as the seed unit has a germinable 
<br>caryopsis in the spike it is considered viable and used 
<br>in the computation of pure live seed by the seed 
<br>analyst. Thus a spike may contain several germinable 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">caryopses, but is counted only as one for the purpose 
<br>of germination percentage. 
<br> 
<br>The effect of burning on seed yield was studied by 
<br>Newell etal. (1962) in fertilized and unfertilized 
<br>plots. Although the seed yield results were 
<br>numerically larger from both levels of fertilized plots 
<br>when burned, the differences could not be proven to 
<br>be statistically different. This finding is noteworthy 
<br>since it proves that proper burning, if not conducted 
<br>too late in the spring, does not reduce seed yield. 
<br>Burning is a proven method of cleaning the field for 
<br>the new seed crop year. Burning has also been known 
<br>to help control cool season weeds and reduce disease 
<br>inoculums for the new crop.  
<br> 
<br>Thus, side-oats grama may be grown for seed in 
<br>cultivated rows, and will respond to timely 
<br>fertilization and irrigation applications.
