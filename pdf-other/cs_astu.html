<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Ethnobotanic</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">: Milkweed has been used for fiber, 
<br>food, and medicine by people all over the United 
<br>States and southern Canada.  Fibers from the stems of 
<br>milkweed have been identified in prehistoric textiles 
<br>in the Pueblo region.  Tewa-speaking people of the 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Rio Grande still make string and rope from these 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">fibers.  At the Zuni Pueblo, the silky seed fibers are 
<br>spun on a hand-held wooden spindle and made into 
<br>yarn and woven into fabric, especially for dancers.  
<br>Pueblo people ate green milkweed pods and 
<br>uncooked roots from one of the species that forms 
<br>fleshy tubers underground. 
<br> 
<br>Milkweeds supply tough fibers for making cords and 
<br>ropes, and for weaving a coarse cloth.  Milkweed 
<br>stems are collected after the stalks senesce in late fall 
<br>to early winter.  The dried stalks are split open to 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">release the fibers.  Milkweed fibers are sometimes

<br>drawing the fibers over a hard surface.  The cord is  
<br> 
<br>formed by twisting the fiber opposite each other and 
<br>twining them together.  Often this is accomplished by 
<br>rolling the fibers on the thigh, while twisting them 
<br>together. 
<br> 
<br>The young shoots, stems, flower buds, immature 
<br>fruits, and roots of butterfly milkweed were boiled 
<br>and eaten as a vegetable by various indigenous 
<br>groups of eastern and mid-western America.   
<br> 
<br>Butterfly milkweed has many medicinal uses.  The 
<br>Omahas and Poncas ate the raw root of the butterfly 
<br>milkweed for bronchial and pulmonary troubles.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Butterfly milkweed root was also chewed and placed 
<br>on wounds, or dried, pulverized, and blown into 
<br>wounds.  The Omaha tribe used butterfly milkweed 
<br>medicine for rites belonging to the Shell Society.  
<br>The Dakotas used the butterfly milkweed as an 
<br>emetic.  The Menominis considered the butterfly 
<br>milkweed, which they called the &quot;deceiver,&quot; one of 
<br>their most important medicines.   
<br> 
<br>Generalized medicinal uses for milkweed species 
<br>include 1) its use in a salve for scrofulous swelling, 
<br>2) as a diarrhea medicine, 3) drunk by mothers 
<br>unable to produce milk, 4) medicine for snow 
<br>blindness and other forms of blindness, 5) relief of 
<br>sore throat, 6) applied chewed root for swelling and 
<br>rashes, 7) to expel tapeworm, 8) to treat colic, 9) to 
<br>act as contraceptives, and 10) to cure snakebite.   
<br> 
<br>European Americans used </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Asclepias tuberosa</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">, called 
<br>&quot;pleurisy root&quot;, to relieve inflammation of the lining 
<br>of the lungs and thorax, and to relieve bronchial and 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">pulmonary trouble.  Pleurisy root is a stimulant to the 
<br>vagus nerve, producing perspiration, expectoration, 
<br>and bronchial dilation.  As its name signifies, it is 
<br>useful for pleurisy and mild pulmonary edema, 
<br>increasing fluid circulation, cilia function, and 
<br>lymphatic drainage.  The root of the butterfly 
<br>milkweed, was officially listed in the U.S. 
<br>Pharmacopoeia from 1820 to 1905 and in the 
<br>National Formulary from 1916 to 1936.

<br>Milkweed species, as a group, are known to contain 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">cardiac glycosides that are poisonous both to humans

<br>poisoning by the cardiac glycosides include dullness, 
<br>weakness, bloating, inability to stand or walk, high 
<br>body temperature, rapid and weak pulse, difficulty 
<br>breathing, dilated pupils, spasms, and coma. 
<br> 
<br>The cardiac glycoside in milkweed has also been 
<br>useful as a chemical defense for monarch butterflies 
<br>(</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Danaus plexippus</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">).  Chemicals from the milkweed 
<br>plant make the monarch caterpillar's flesh distasteful 
<br>to most predators.  Monarch butterflies are specific to 
<br>milkweed plants.  This is the only type of plant on 
<br>which the eggs are laid and the larvae will feed and 
<br>mature into a chrysalis.  Eggs are laid on the 
<br>underside of young healthy leaves.  Monarch, Queen, 
<br>and Viceroy butterflies are Müllerian mimics, all are 
<br>toxic, and have co-evolved similar warning patterns 
<br>to avoid predation.

<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Wildlife</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">: Milkweed species are attractive to many 
<br>insect species, including the large milkweed bug, 
<br>common milkweed bug, red milkweed beetle, blue 
<br>milkweed beetle, and bees.  Accordingly, this is a 
<br>wonderful horticultural plant for landscaping to 
<br>attract butterflies (particularly monarchs), whose 
<br>numbers are declining and migratory routes changing 
<br>due to lack of appropriate habitat.  Butterfly 
<br>milkweed also has strikingly beautiful flowers. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Caution</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">: At one time, milkweed was classified as a 
<br>noxious weed due to reported toxic effects on 
<br>livestock, and efforts were made to eradicate it.  
<br>Milkweeds are thought to be poisonous to cows and 
<br>sheep.  Milkweed also can have invasive 
<br>characteristics in disturbed areas.

<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Asclepias tuberosa </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">is a perennial herb 3-9 dm tall 
<br>with woody rootstocks.  According to Kelly 
<br>Kindscher (1992), &quot;Asclepias comes from the name 
<br>of the Greek god of medicine, Asklepios.  The 
<br>species name, </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">tuberosa, </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> means full of swellings or 
<br>knobs, referring to the enlarged root system.&quot;  
<br>Butterfly milkweed stems are hairy, erect, and grow 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">in numerous clumps.  There is a watery sap within 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">the stems and leaves.  The leaves are alternate, 
<br>simple, crowded, lance-shaped, 5-10 cm long, shiny

<br>bent downward, orange to red or sometimes yellow, 
<br>topped by a crown of 5 erect hoods, each one 
<br>containing a short horn.  Fruits are hairy, spindle-
<br>shaped pods 8-15 cm long.  The numerous seeds each 
<br>have a tuft of long white hairs at the tip. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Distribution 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Milkweeds grow in clumps beside roadways, on 
<br>abandoned farmlands, and in other open areas 
<br>throughout the United States.  Butterfly milkweed 
<br>grows on sandy, loamy, or rocky limestone soils of 
<br>prairies, open woodlands, roadsides, and disturbed 
<br>areas similar to other milkweed species.  For current 
<br>distribution, please consult the Plant Profile page for 
<br>this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Establishment 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Butterfly milkweed is easily propagated by both seed 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">and rhizome cuttings.  Both seedlings and cuttings 
<br>will usually bloom in their second year, although 
<br>cuttings will occasionally bloom during their first 
<br>year.  Seeds and plants of selected cultivars are 
<br>available from many nurseries.  When the roots of the 
<br>butterfly milkweed were more commonly harvested 
<br>for their medicinal use, the plants were dug when 
<br>dormant in the late fall.  Butterfly milkweed increases 
<br>by underground shoots and can be invasive.  It is 
<br>ideal in semi-dry places where it can spread without 
<br>presenting problems for other ornamental species. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Seed Collections 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Asclepias tuberosa</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> is easily propagated from seed.  
<br>Collect seeds after the pods have ripened, but before 
<br>they have split open.  The seeds are wind dispersed, 
<br>so be careful when gathering to place in a paper or 
<br>burlap bag to avoid losing them.  Butterfly milkweed 
<br>seeds should be cold-treated for three months.  Seeds 
<br>can be directly sewn into the ground in the fall.  The 
<br>seed is very viable.  It is not certain how long you can 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">store the seeds.   
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Whole Plant Collections 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Propagation by cuttings of the tuberous rhizome is 
<br>also easy and reliable.  The cuttings should be made 
<br>when the plant is dormant.  Each piece of the rhizome 
<br>should have at least one bud (they are about two 
<br>inches apart).  Timing of propagation is important.  
<br>Harvest or divide plants and get the plants in the 
<br>ground by late fall so they can develop enough root 
<br>growth to survive the winter.  Irrigation the first year 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">will improve survival, and by the second year the 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">root system should be well enough established so 
<br>plants will survive on their own.

<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Management 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Both milkweed and dogbane are burned in the fall to 
<br>eliminate dead stalks and stimulate new growth.  
<br>Burning causes new growth to have taller, straighter 
<br>stems (with longer fibers).  It also stimulates flower 
<br>and seed production.  </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">When used for fiber, milkweed is collected in the 
<br>autumn after the leaves have begun to fall off, the 
<br>stalks turn gray or tan, and the plant dries up.  If the 
<br>milkweed stems will break off at the ground it's time 
<br>to harvest.  Breaking off as many stalks as possible 
<br>encourages resprouting in the spring.  The dried 
<br>stalks are then split open and the fibers are twisted 
<br>into string. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br>Vast quantities of fiber plants are required for nets, 
<br>regalia, and cordage.  Blackburn and Anderson 
<br>(1993) quote Craig Bates of the Yosemite Museum 
<br>that it takes approximately five stalks of milkweed or 
<br>Indian hemp to manufacture one foot of cordage.  A 
<br>Sierra Miwok feather skirt or cape contained about 
<br>100 feet of cordage made from approximately 500 
<br>plant stalks, while a deer net 40 feet in length (Barrett 
<br>and Gifford 1933:178) contained some 7,000 feet of 
<br>cordage, which would have required the harvesting of 
<br>a staggering 35,000 plant stalks.
