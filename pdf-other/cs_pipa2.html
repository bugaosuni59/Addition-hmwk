<br>southeastern  forests  (Delcourt  et  al.  1993).  One  of  the 
<br>most  important  of  these  wood  resources  was  the  pines. 
<br>Pines had many uses among southeastern tribes, but often 
<br>the kind of pine used is not identified. Given that in the 
<br>past,  longleaf  pine  dominated  many  landscapes  in  the 
<br>Southeast, it is likely that it was utilized for many of the 
<br>purposes  described  here.  The  Choctaw  made  darts  that 
<br>were used in blowguns from splinters of pine, sharpened 
<br>at one end (Bushnell 1909). Tribes of the Southeast used 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">pine wood for house frames, canoes, frames for skin boats 
<br>or  rafts,  and  bows  (Swanton  1946).  The  Creek  and 
<br>Choctaw used pine bark to cover the roofs of their houses 
<br>(Swanton 1931, 1946; Walker 2004). The Cherokee made  
<br>canoes out of logs of large pines and they were hollowed

<br>and today locating enough sources of needles is difficult 
<br>in  Louisiana  (Rogers  2012)  and  many  parts  of  the 
<br>Southeast.  
<br> 
<br>Non-Indian  women  in  the  early  to  mid-part  of  the 
<br>twentieth  century  made  longleaf  pine  needle  baskets  for 
<br>gathering  fruits  and  berries,  vegetables  and  flowers,  and 
<br>also  eggs  from  the  barnyard  (Tappan  1930).  They  also 
<br>made  them  for  decoration  and  pine  needle  basketry  was 
<br>taught in local schools (Hammel 1917). The favored time 
<br>for gathering the needles was autumn (Lang 1926). 
<br> 
<br>Many early non-Indian settlers in the Southeastern United 
<br>States  considered  longleaf  pine  the  most  valuable  of  all 
<br>the kinds of pines (Porcher 1991). They found medicinal 
<br>value in longleaf pine using turpentine as a stimulant and 
<br>diuretic, and if taken in large doses, it served as a laxative 
<br>(Porcher  1991).  The  turpentine  was  also  used  in  the 
<br>making  of  soap.  The  buds  of  the  pine  or  the  inner  bark 
<br>was  steeped  in  water  and  drunk  as  a  cure  for  colds  and 
<br>coughs (Porcher 1991). As non-Indian settlers moved into 
<br>the area, they  grazed their sheep, hogs, and cattle in  the 
<br>open  understories  of  these  pine  forests  and  hogs  also 
<br>consumed  the  pine  nuts  (Porcher  1991).  By  the  late 
<br>1700’s  Europeans  and  Americans  had  created  an 
<br>increased  demand  for  naval  stores  where  the  wood  was 
<br>employed in the siding of ships, masts, yardarms and for 
<br>floorboards in buildings (Porcher 1991). The tree took on 
<br>great  economic  importance  in  Western  society  for  saw 
<br>timber.  The  second-growth 
<br>longleaf  pine  became 
<br>important for lumber, pulpwood, crossties, boxes, crates, 
<br>fuelwood, and in producing turpentine and rosin (Mattoon 
<br>1922).  Two  distinct  pine  products,  tar  derived  by  slow-
<br>burning  pine  wood  in  a  kiln,  and  pitch  made  from  tar 
<br>boiled  in  a  kettle  or  cauldron  were  used  to  seal  naval 
<br>ships, making them watertight (Earley 2004). At one time, 
<br>the  bulk  of  the  turpentine  produced  in  the  United  States 
<br>came  from  southeastern  longleaf  pine  forests  (Mattoon 
<br>1922).  Forest  examiner  Wilbur  Mattoon  commented  in 
<br>1922  on  the  extensive  destruction  of  young  stands  that 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">were worked heavily for these products. 
<br>   
<br>Today  young  stands  of  longleaf  pine  can  produce  pine 
<br>straw  mulch, a very important regional product obtained 
<br>from  longleaf  pine  stands  beginning  at  about  age  8, 
<br>peaking  at  age  18  and  sometimes  continuing  for  many 
<br>more years (Wallace and Ward, 2011; Ward, 2011).  Care 
<br>must be taken if pine straw is to be harvested sustainably 
<br>and  native  understory  plants  conserved  (Ward,  2011).  
<br>Mature  longleaf  forests  produce  high  quality  timber 
<br>products including utility poles, lumber and pulpwood.

<br>Description 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">General:</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">  The  tree  grows  up  to  120  feet  tall  (37  meters) 
<br>tall,  with  a  rounded  crown.  The  orange-brown  trunk  is 
<br>straight,  up  to  30  inches  (76  cm)  in  diameter  and  it  has 
<br>coarse,  rectangular,  scaly  plates  (Harlow  and  Harrar, 
<br>1969).  The  leaves  are  25-40  cm.  long  and  are  in  threes 
<br>that  are  persistent  for  2  years  (Gleason  and  Cronquist 
<br>1991;  Radford  et  al.  1968).  Longleaf  pine  has  a  deep 
<br>taproot  and  a  definite  grass  stage  (Kral  1993).  The  seed 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">cones are solitary or paired 15 cm. long.  A heavy crop of 
<br>pine cones bearing seed occurs at intervals of about every 
<br>seven  years  and  the  seeds  require  two  years  to  mature 
<br>(Mattoon 1922).  
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Distribution:</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">  The  forest  grows  from  0-700  m  and  once 
<br>occupied a belt extending through the Coastal Plain from 
<br>extreme  southern  Virginia  to  the  Everglades  in  Florida 
<br>and west into Texas, originally covering about 92 million 
<br>acres prior to European settlement (Shantz and Zon 1924; 
<br>Frost 1993). Though confined mostly to the Coastal Plain, 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">longleaf can also be encountered in parts of the Piedmont, 
<br>as  well  as  the  southern  foothills  of  the  Appalachian 
<br>Mountains  (Earley  2004).  When  the  Spanish  arrived  in 
<br>the early 1500s, longleaf pine was the dominant tree over 
<br>60 million acres of the Southeast, and it grew in mixtures 
<br>with  other  pines  and  hardwoods  on  an  additional  30 
<br>million acres (Earley 2004).  Presently longleaf occupies 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:323px; top:2629px; width:236px; height:657px;"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">only  3.4  million  acres  (America’s  Longleaf  2009). 
<br>Longleaf  pine  communities  have  been  reduced  to  about 
<br>three  percent  of  their  original  area,  due  to  logging, 
<br>turpentining,  open  range  grazing  by  hogs  and  other 
<br>livestock,  fire  suppression,  clearing  for  agriculture,  and 
<br>urban development (Frost 1993). The longleaf pine forests 
<br>of  Texas  and  Louisiana  have  declined  by  eighty-five 
<br>percent since 1935 (Bridges and Orzell 1989 cited in Noss 
<br>et.  al  1995).  Ninety-eight  percent  of  the  presettlement 
<br>longleaf pine forests in the Southeastern Coastal Plain are 
<br>gone (Noss et al. 1995). Longleaf pine forests of Florida 
<br>have dwindled by eighty-eight percent (Kautz 1993 cited 
<br>in Noss et al. 1995). Lawrence S. Earley (2004) estimates 
<br>that  the  majority  of  old-growth  longleaf  pine  forest  is 
<br>gone—with  a  mere  12,000  acres  remaining  in  scattered 
<br>stands. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Habitat:</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">  Longleaf  pine  grows  in  pure  stands  over  large 
<br>areas and has the ability to grow on poor, dry, and poorly 
<br>drained  soils  (Mattoon  1922).  It  is  found  in  dry  sandy 
<br>uplands, sandhills, savannas, wet flatwoods of the coastal 
<br>plain  from  Virginia  to  Texas,  as  well  as  montane  sites 
<br>including  dry,  rocky  ridgetop  areas  in  Alabama  and 
<br>Georgia (Estes 2006). The region experiences from 40 to 
<br>60 inches of rain a year. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Adaptation 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Longleaf  pine  forests  are  adapted  to  the  disturbances  of 
<br>fire  and  hurricanes  and  frequent  low  intensity  burns  are 
<br>important  in  maintaining  variable  horizontal  structure  in 
<br>this  plant  community  (Landers  et  al  1995;  Estes  2006). 
<br>Longleaf pine is remarkably resistant to fire. It puts out an 
<br>extensive  root  system  following  seed  germination, 
<br>enabling  the  seedling  to  sprout  from  its  root  collar  if 
<br>defoliated  by  fire  (Carey  1992;  Ware  et  al.  1993).  The 
<br>terminal bud of the seedling is protected from the heat of 
<br>grass  fires  by  a  rosette  of  long,  green  needles  and  older 
<br>growth  has  a  thick,  fire-resistant  bark  (Watson  1940; 
<br>Carey  1992).  The  large  seeds  germinate  best  on  bare 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">mineral soil—an effective way to create these conditions 
<br>is  through  prescribed  burning  (Garren  1943  cited  in 
<br>Wagner 2003; Watson 1940). 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>When  the  earliest  explorers  came  into  the  southeastern 
<br>United  States,  they  commented  on  the  wide  spacing  of 
<br>longleaf pine trees. Early ecologists such as B.W. Wells 
<br>marveled at the size of the old-growth trees, measuring a 
<br>yard  or  more  in  basal  diameter  (Wells  1932  cited  in 
<br>Earley 
<br>describe 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Southeastern Indian burning practices in the longleaf pine 
<br>forests  for  many reasons such as to  facilitate  hunting by 
<br>opening  the  woods,  encourage  forage  for  wildlife,  and 
<br>control insects (Earley 2004; Lawson 1967).

<br>number and vigor of hardwood sprouts (Jose et. al.2006). 
<br>If  competing  vegetation  is  not  controlled,  longleaf  will 
<br>remain in the “grass stage” for up to 15 years, rather than 
<br>the minimum of 2 years (Jose et. al.  2006). Seedlings in 
<br>the grass stage are capable of re-sprouting if damaged or 
<br>top-killed (Jose et. al.  2006).  Height growth can be rapid 
<br>once  seedlings  emerge  from  the  grass  stage.    Young 
<br>stands of longleaf tend to quickly develop a range of size 
<br>classes  reducing  the  risk  of  stagnation  and  the  need  for 
<br>pre-commercial thinning (Burns 1983).

<br>Pests and Diseases 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">The longleaf pine has two serious enemies—the hog and 
<br>the  brown  spot  needle  disease  (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Septoria  acicola</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">)  which 
<br>causes  defoliation.  Hogs  root  the  seedlings  up  and  can 
<br>live on the stored food material in the roots. The needle 
<br>disease  is  caused  by  a  fungus  which  is  often  a  very 
<br>serious  enemy  of  the  young  seedlings  underneath  a 
<br>“rough” of dead grass. Burning the dead grass in winter at 
<br>intervals  of  more  than  one  year  can  control  this  disease 
<br>(Chapman  1941;  Greene  1931).    Longleaf  pine  is  less

<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">These fires were frequent, every two to four years (Rogers 
<br>2012). The time of year for most Indian-set fires was fall 
<br>to  winter  (Ware  et  al.  1993).  Together,  lightning  and 
<br>Indian-set  fires  created  the  open  forests  that  Europeans, 
<br>such as William Bartram, observed in the Southeast. 
<br> 
<br>Many of the ecosystems where longleaf pine grows, such 
<br>as the pine flatwood ecosystem, are fire dependent. Pine 
<br>flatwoods  have  a  fire  frequency  of  every  one  to  eight 
<br>years  (Behm  2003).  Numerous  studies  demonstrate  that 
<br>prescribed  burning  can  help  put  cutover  longleaf  lands 
<br>back into timber production without planting (Bruce and 
<br>Bickford  1950).  Longleaf  pine  grows  best  with  low-
<br>intensity fires spaced one to three years apart (Kalisz et al. 
<br>1986; Myers 1985 cited in Wagner 2003). Some research 
<br>suggests that many longleaf pine sites have been replaced 
<br>by  hardwoods  and  other  species  of  pines  (Boyer  1990; 
<br>Frost  1993;  Myers  and  Peroni  1983).  Many  of  these 
<br>vegetation changes are in part a result of shifts in the fire 
<br>regimes,  likely  due  to  a  decrease  in  Indian  burning  and 
<br>lightning fire suppression.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br>Establishment and Management 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Seeds  of  longleaf  pine  are  the  largest  of  the  southern 
<br>pines. They do not store well and are best planted in the 
<br>fall after collection between  October and November and 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">test  for  seed  viability  prior  to  planting.    Longleaf  is 
<br>mostly regenerated with bare root or container seedlings.  
<br>Best results are obtained with container seedlings, planted 
<br>slightly  above  ground  level  when  soil  is  moist  between 
<br>November  and  March.  Planting  rates  vary  from  300  to 
<br>900 per acre but the most commonly recommended rate is 
<br>600-700  per  acre  (Longleaf  Pine  Partnership  Council 
<br>2013). 
<br>  Longleaf  is  very  susceptible  to  competing 
<br>vegetation.    Competing  vegetation  must  be  controlled 
<br>either chemically or mechanically with seedlings planted 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">in the center of a weed free area with a radius of at least 
<br>15 inches (Longleaf Alliance 2009).  If there is a history 
<br>of  cultivation  sub-soiling  will  be  necessary  to  break  up 
<br>soil compaction (Longleaf Alliance 2009).  Prescribed fire 
<br>applied at an interval of 1-3 years is necessary to exclude 
<br>hardwood  trees  and  shrubs  and  maintain  a  natural 
<br>understory of grasses and forbs.  An occasional growing
