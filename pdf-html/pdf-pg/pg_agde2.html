<br> 
<br>very heavy grazing pressure (65-70 percent 
<br>utilization) once stands are established.  Crested 
<br>wheatgrasses are good forage producers in the areas 
<br>where best adapted.  Crested wheatgrasses are 
<br>generally not recommended above 12-14 inches of 
<br>precipitation because better forage species 
<br>alternatives are available.  Crested wheatgrass stands 
<br>generally produce from 1.5 to 2 times more than the 
<br>native stands, generally in the bluebunch wheatgrass

<br>are well adapted to stabilization of disturbed soils.  
<br>They compete well with other aggressive introduced 
<br>plants during the establishment period.  Crested 
<br>wheatgrass is not compatible in mixes with native 
<br>species because it is very competitive and will out-
<br>compete slower developing native species.  Their 
<br>drought tolerance, fibrous root systems, and good 
<br>seedling vigor make these species ideal for 
<br>reclamation in areas receiving 8 to 16 inches annual 
<br>precipitation.  In areas above 14 inches annual 
<br>precipitation, ‘Roadcrest’ and ‘Ephraim’ may exhibit 
<br>their rhizomatous traits and make excellent low 
<br>maintenance lawns when broadcast seeded to 
<br>establish thick lawns.  These grasses can be used in 
<br>urban areas where irrigation water is limited to 
<br>provide ground cover, weed control, and to stabilize 
<br>ditch banks, dikes, pipelines, power lines, and

<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">General</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">: Desert wheatgrass is introduced from Asia.  
<br>Within the crested wheatgrasses, three species are 
<br>recognized: Fairway or crested wheatgrass 
<br>(</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Agropyron cristatum), </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">standard or desert wheatgrass 
<br>(</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Agropyron desertorum), </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">and Siberian wheatgrass 
<br>(</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Agropyron fragile</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">).  Fairway has short-broad spikes 
<br>that taper at the top, smaller seeds, grows shorter, and 
<br>has finer leaves and stems than standard wheatgrass.  
<br>Standard has longer spikes than fairway, but vary in 
<br>spike shape from comb-like to oblong.  Fairway and 
<br>standard grow from 1 to 3 feet tall with seed spikes 
<br>1.5 to 3 inches long.  Spikelets flattened, closely 
<br>overlapping, oriented at a slight angle on the rachis.  
<br>The lemmas are linear-lanceolate narrowing to a 
<br>short awn.  Glumes are awl shaped and firm, and 
<br>keeled.  Culms are erect.  Leaves are flat, smooth 
<br>below, slightly scabrous (coarse) above and vary in 
<br>width from 2 to 6 mm.  Siberian is very similar to 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">fairway and standard, but has finer leaves and stems, 
<br>narrower and awnless glumes and lemmas, and the 
<br>spikelets are more ascending, giving the spike a 
<br>narrow, oblong, sub-cylindrical shape.  Siberian is 
<br>more drought tolerant and retains its greenness and 
<br>palatability later into the summer than either standard 
<br>or fairway types.  
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Distribution 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">This species is introduced into the U.S.  For current 
<br>distribution, please consult the Plant Profile page for 
<br>this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Establishment 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Adaptation</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">: Crested wheatgrasses are adapted for 
<br>non-irrigated seedings where annual precipitation 
<br>averages 8-16 inches or more (fairway should 
<br>average 10 inches or more) and where the frost-free 
<br>period is generally less than 140 days.  Standard and 
<br>hybrid crosses are superior above 8 inches annual 
<br>precipitation in spring recovery and grazing 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">readiness.  On droughty sites with 7-10 inches annual 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">precipitation, Siberian wheatgrass may be the best 
<br>choice, it is known to surpass Standard and hybrid 
<br>crosses in rate of establishment, stand persistence, 
<br>and total forage yield on the more arid sites.  Siberian 
<br>has been seeded in areas with as little as 5 inches of 
<br>precipitation with some success.  
<br> 
<br>Crested wheatgrass should generally be seeded below 
<br>7,000 feet elevation.  Fairway does well up to 9,000 
<br>feet elevation.  Crested wheatgrass does well on 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">shallow to deep, moderately coarse to fine textured, 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">moderately well to well drained soils.  Under saline 
<br>conditions, vigor and production are reduced.  
<br>Fairway is not well adapted to silty soils.  Siberian is 
<br>well adapted to light-sandy, droughty soils.  All

<br>withstand moderate periodic flooding, not exceeding 
<br>7-10 days in the spring.  They are very tolerant of 
<br>fire.  They will not tolerate long periods of 
<br>inundation-standing water, poorly drained soils, or 
<br>excessive irrigation.  
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Planting</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">: Crested wheatgrass should be seeded with a 
<br>drill at a depth of 1/2 inch or less on medium to fine 
<br>textured soils and 1 inch or less on coarse textured 
<br>soils.  Single species seeding rates recommended for 
<br>all crested wheatgrasses are 5-7 pounds Pure Live 
<br>Seed (PLS) per acre or 20 to 30 PLS per square foot.  
<br>Single species seeding rates recommended for 
<br>Siberian wheatgrass is 6-8 pounds PLS per acre or 
<br>24-30 PLS per square foot.  If used as a component 
<br>of a mix, with alfalfa (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Medicago</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> spp.), sainfoin 
<br>(</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Onobrychis viciifolia</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">), yellow sweetclover 
<br>(</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Melilotus officinalis</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">), cicer milkvetch (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Astragalus 
<br>cicer</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">), or others adjust to percent of mix desired.  For 
<br>mined lands and other harsh critical areas, the 
<br>seeding rate should be increased to 10-12 pounds 
<br>PLS per acre or 40 to 50 PLS per square foot.  
<br>Mulching and light irrigation on highly disturbed, 
<br>droughty areas are beneficial for stand establishment.  
<br> 
<br>The best seeding results are obtained from seeding in 
<br>very early spring on heavy to medium textured soils 
<br>and as dormant seeding in late fall on medium to 
<br>light textured soils.  Late summer (August - mid 
<br>September) seedings are not recommended unless 
<br>irrigation is available. 
<br> 
<br>Crested and Siberian wheatgrasses establish quickly, 
<br>with ‘Hycrest’ and ‘Vavilov’ noted for their seedling 
<br>vigor.  They should not be seeded with native 
<br>species, unless seeding rates are very low (&lt; 2 
<br>pounds per acre).  They may compliment native 
<br>stands that are already partially established.  Under 
<br>favorable conditions, they are good weed barriers. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Stands may require weed control measures during 
<br>establishment, but application of 2,4-D should not be 
<br>made until plants have reached the four to six leaf 
<br>stages.  Mow when weeds are beginning to bloom to 
<br>reduce weed seed development.  Grasshoppers and 
<br>other insects may also damage new stands and use of 
<br>pesticides may be required. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Management 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Crested wheatgrass “greens-up” in the spring about 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">10 days after bluegrass species and about 2 weeks 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">earlier than native wheatgrasses.  They make good 
<br>spring growth, little summer growth, and good fall 
<br>growth, if moisture is available.  
<br> 
<br></span></div><span style="position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:1734px; width:612px; height:792px;"></span>
<div style="position:absolute; top:1734px;"><a name="3">Page 3</a></div>
<div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:1804px; width:219px; height:645px;"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Crested wheatgrasses have good palatability for 
<br>livestock and some wildlife.  Livestock and wildlife 
<br>will graze crested wheatgrass throughout the spring 
<br>growing season until it becomes too coarse, and again 
<br>in fall if regrowth occurs.  Established stands can 
<br>withstand very heavy grazing.  
<br> 
<br>New stands of crested wheatgrass should not be 
<br>grazed until they are firmly established and have 
<br>started to produce seed heads.  Six inches of new 
<br>growth should be attained in spring before grazing is 
<br>allowed in established stands.  Three inches of 
<br>stubble should remain at the end of the grazing 
<br>season to maintain the long-term health of the plant.  
<br>In addition, leaving three inches or more stubble will 
<br>result in a 10 - 14 day earlier growth period or 
<br>“green-up” in spring.   
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Crested wheatgrasses are low maintenance plants 
<br>requiring little additional treatment or care.  
<br>However, spring/fall deferment or grazing rotations is 
<br>recommended to maintain plant health and to 
<br>maximize forage production potential.  
<br> 
<br>Crested wheatgrass is competitive with weedy 
<br>species, but can be crowded out by some aggressive 
<br>introduced weedy species and native woody species.  
<br> 
<br>Crested wheatgrass can be used for hay production 
<br>and will make nutritious feed, but is more suited to 
<br>pasture use.  Light infrequent applications of nitrogen 
<br>(25 pounds/acre) and light irrigation will increase 
<br>total biomass production and lengthen the growing 
<br>period.  Re-growth of crested wheatgrasses is slow. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Environmental Concerns</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">: Crested wheatgrasses are 
<br>introduced, long-lived, and spread primarily via seed.  
<br>Spread of rhizomatous varieties is very slow in the 
<br>case of the ‘Roadcrest’ and ‘Ephraim’.  They are not 
<br>considered &quot;weedy&quot; or invasive species.  Most 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">seedings do not spread beyond original plantings.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">They will cross with each other, but do not cross with 
<br>native species.  
<br> 
<br>Crested wheatgrasses resist cheatgrass competition 
<br>better than most native species, because it germinates 
<br>earlier and grows more rapidly at colder 
<br>temperatures.  This has an important competitive 
<br>advantage when dealing with winter annual species, 
<br>such as cheatgrass.  
<br> 
<br>Full, properly managed stands of crested wheatgrass 
<br>generally withstand encroachment by native grasses 
<br>and forbs.  When inter-seeded into native stands, 
<br>crested wheatgrass commonly co-exists with native 
<br>grasses, forbs, and shrubs.  Some native shrubs, such

<br>spp.), often invade crested wheatgrass stands, 
<br>especially if native seed sources are nearby. 
<br> 
<br>Due to commonly being planted in monoculture 
<br>(single species) stands in the past, some feel-crested 
<br>wheatgrasses are not ecologically appropriate and 
<br>contribute to a lack of biodiversity.  If planting this 
<br>species, it is important to consider a diverse species 
<br>mix to benefit many species.

<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Seed production of crested wheatgrasses has been 
<br>very successful under cultivated conditions.  Row 
<br>spacing of 24 to 30 inches when irrigated and 36 
<br>inches or greater under dryland conditions are 
<br>recommended.  Early spring or late fall seedings are 
<br>recommended under dryland conditions.  Early spring 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">seedings are recommended under irrigated 
<br>conditions.  When irrigated, spring seedings 
<br>consistently yield more seed during the first year of 
<br>seed production.  To obtain maximum seed 
<br>production, fall plantings are not recommended. 
<br> 
<br>Control weeds during stand establishment and long 
<br>term management of stand by clipping, hand rouging 
<br>or light rates of herbicide (2,4-D or Bromoxynil 
<br>according to label) after the five-leaf stage.  Fertilizer 
<br>is generally not recommended during establishment.  
<br>If soil nitrogen and phosphorus are low, an 
<br>application of 10-15 pounds per acre nitrogen and 20-
<br>30 pounds per acre phosphorus may be applied prior 
<br>to planting.  Fertilize for full seed production 
<br>following the establishment year in early fall or use a 
<br>split application in early fall and again in early 
<br>spring.  Very early spring application of nitrogen may 
<br>be beneficial on sandy soils to promote vegetative 
<br>growth.  When irrigated, apply adequate moisture for 
<br>germination, establishment and to bring soils to field 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">capacity.  Following stand establishment, fertilize 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">and irrigate soon after seed harvest in fall to stimulate 
<br>seed head primordia development.  Do not stress 
<br>plants during re-growth and tillering in the fall, late 
<br>boot stage, and during pollination.  Avoid irrigating 
<br>during flowering.   
<br> 
<br>Seed fields are productive for four to five years.  
<br>Average production of 200 to 300 pounds per acre 
<br>can be expected under dryland conditions in 14 inch 
<br>plus rainfall areas.  Average production of 500 to 600 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">pounds per acre can be expected under irrigated 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">conditions.  The seed heads do not readily shatter, but 
<br>some shatter can be expected.  Harvesting is best 
<br>completed by direct combining when the top of the 
<br>seed head begins to shatter or wind-rowing at hard

<br>fairway.  It is not as drought tolerant as Siberian 
<br>wheatgrass.  Standard crested wheatgrass is adapted 
<br>to the northwest, intermountain, and Great Plains 
<br>regions with at least 8 inches (‘Douglas’ requires 13-
<br>14 inches) of annual precipitation below 6500 feet 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">elevation.  It does well on shallow to deep, 
<br>moderately coarse to fine textured, moderately well 
<br>to well drained and weakly acidic to moderately

<br>with heavy seeds that are awnless.  The seed heads 
<br>are dense and compressed.  It has good seedling vigor 
<br>and seed quality and long-term forage yields are 
<br>equal to the newer varieties.  It is very palatable in
