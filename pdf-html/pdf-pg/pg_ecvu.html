<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">General</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">: Blueweed is a member of the borage family 
<br>(Boraginaceae). It is an introduced species native to 
<br>Europe. Blueweed can be a biennial or short-lived 
<br>perennial. It has a significant rooting system comprised of 
<br>a tap root and smaller fibrous roots. The tap root is black 
<br>and can range in length from 12 to 32 inches (30.5 to 81 
<br>centimeters), allowing deep soil penetration. Vegetation 
<br>forms initially as a basal rosette. Rosette leaves are 
<br>simple, entire, oblanceolate, approximately 2.5 to 10 
<br>inches in length and 0.5 to 3 inches in width, with a single 
<br>vein and a short petiole. Stem leaves are alternate in 
<br>arrangement becoming progressively smaller and bract-
<br>like towards the top of the stem. Mature plants grow one 
<br>to many erect, branching flowering stems reaching over 
<br>36 inches in height. Both the stems and leaves are covered 
<br>with stout, spreading hairs that have swollen, red, purple 
<br>or black bases, underlain by smaller fine appressed hairs. 
<br>The swollen bases of the spreading hairs give the stems a 
<br>spotted appearance. 
<br> 
<br>The stem terminates in a panicle inflorescence, each 
<br>branch of the panicle forms a short helicoid cyme, shaped 
<br>like a scorpions tail, subtended by an upper foliage leaf. 
<br>There can be as many as 50 cymes per stem, and each 
<br>cyme bears up to 20 flowers. The showy flowers range in 
<br>size from 0.4 to 0.8 inch. The funnel-shaped, five-lobed, 
<br>pubescent flowers are typically bright blue, but may also 
<br>be purple, pink, or rarely white. Flowers widen as they 
<br>mature, and the upper lobes are noticeably longer. 
<br>Another identifying characteristic is the five pink or red 
<br>stamens, one of which is noticeably shorter than the four 
<br>which are long-exerted beyond the corolla tube. The 
<br>superior ovary is four-lobed with the style arising from 
<br>the center of the lobes. 
<br> 
<br>The seeds of blueweed are called nutlets. They are brown 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">or gray with a rounded pyramid shape, and are very small, 
<br>(&lt; 0.1 inch long and wide, or 2.4 x 1.6 x 1.5 millimeters). 
<br>The surface of the nutlets is rough and very hard. This 
<br>characteristic provides blueweed seeds with moderate 
<br>survival times in the seed bank, with a three year survival, 
<br>typical at depths of 6 inches (15 centimeters) or more. 
<br>

<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">Life history</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">: Blueweed is a monocarpic perennial, 
<br>meaning it flowers once and dies. This typically takes two 
<br>years (biennial) but can take as long as five years. No 
<br>blueweed plant that has flowered has been observed to 
<br>survive and grow a secondary rosette. Populations of 
<br>blueweed have been observed to be cyclic similar to 
<br>yellow sweetclover; one year an infestation will be

<br>sparse population. 
<br> 
<br>Typically, seedlings emerge in the spring. However, some 
<br>seedlings emerge in the summer and autumn. Blueweed 
<br>seeds (nutlets) have high viability at maturity (90%) and 
<br>the thick nutlet wall provides some dormancy. 
<br>Stratification increases germination. Seeds can remain 
<br>viable for three years when buried in the soil, but seeds 
<br>sown on the soil surface do not persist for more than one 
<br>year. Vegetative reproduction of blueweed has not been 
<br>observed. 
<br> 
<br>Rosettes develop and increase in diameter throughout the 
<br>growing season. During this time, blueweed forms a large 
<br>root system that enables its survival in drought-prone 
<br>habitats. The semi-succulent leaves and epidermal leaf 
<br>hairs also provide drought tolerance. The older rosette 
<br>leaves die after the onset of freezing in the autumn 
<br>leaving a few small central rosette leaves to survive 
<br>throughout the winter.</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:15px"> 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Rosettes must go through a cold vernalization period and 
<br>reach a certain size before flowering. Bolting begins in 
<br>early June for plants that meet these requirements. 
<br>Flowers bloom beginning in early June and continue 
<br>blooming until mid-September or until the first hard frost. 
<br>Flowering commonly occurs in two phases, the first is 
<br>from June to July with a second flowering phase 
<br>occurring from August to October in later blooming 
<br>plants. Blueweed is pollinated by insects and the ruby-
<br>throated hummingbird. More than 50 insect species visit 
<br>the flowers including honeybees, bumblebees, halicitid 
<br>bees, and butterflies. Seeds mature about one month after 
<br>bloom. Seed dispersal begins about one month after seeds 
<br>mature, generally in early August, peaking in September, 
<br>and continuing through early November. Plants produce 
<br>from 500 to 2,000 seeds per plant. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Bold; font-size:13px">Adaptation 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Blueweed is native to southern Europe. It is adapted to 
<br>temperate areas with cool winters, warm summers, and a 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">relatively moist climate. Arid regions including deserts, 
<br>dry grasslands, and chaparral generally do not support 
<br>blueweed populations. Abundant populations are found 
<br>on coarse, sandy soils of limestone or dolomite parent 
<br>material, although populations can also be found in areas 
<br>with acidic soils and granitic parent material. It grows 
<br>well on soils with poor fertility. It is a weed of sparsely 
<br>vegetated and disturbed areas and typically is found in 
<br>wastelands or disturbed areas, along roadsides and 
<br>watercourses, and in overgrazed pastures. Blueweed does 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">not grow well under dense vegetation. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Bold; font-size:13px">Establishment 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Blueweed nutlets have no morphological adaptations for 
<br>dispersal and most seeds fall to the ground passively near 
<br>the parent plant resulting in a patchy distribution of 
<br>plants. Nutlets weigh about 2.5 milligrams and can drift

<br>transported by floodwaters and rain-wash. Some nutlets 
<br>remain within the calyx of the stiff-haired flower that can 
<br>attach to animal fur. Detached nutlets can also be 
<br>transported in animal fur and by ants. Vehicles and 
<br>equipment can also move seeds long distances. Because 
<br>of its showy blue flowers, blueweed has been planted in 
<br>gardens from which it can spread to adjacent lands.

<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Bold; font-size:13px">Environmental Concerns 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Blueweed reduces forage production and wildlife habitat. 
<br>Grazing animals avoid foraging on blueweed because of 
<br>the stiff hairs on the stems and leaves and because of the 
<br>high concentrations of pyrrolizidine alkaloids contained in 
<br>these plant parts. The alkaloids accumulate in the liver 
<br>when ingested where they can cause liver disease. Skin 
<br>contact with the hairs also causes dermatitis resulting in 
<br>inflammation and itching in humans. Blueweed is an 
<br>alternate host to wheat rust, is a natural host to alfalfa 
<br>mosaic virus, tobacco mosaic virus, and cabbage black 
<br>ring spot.

<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">Herbicide:</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> Herbicide trials on a rangeland site in Ravalli 
<br>County, Montana, showed metsulfuron  (1 ounce/acre 
<br>product-Escort and others), chlorsulfuron (1 ounce/acre

<br>ounce/acre) applied to rosettes in the spring or fall 
<br>provided nearly 100 percent control of blueweed one year

<br>well for smaller infestation if the soil is moist. Care 
<br>should be taken when hand pulling to ensure the tap root 
<br>is removed because this plant can regenerate if the root 
<br>remains. Pulling or digging should be done before plants 
<br>bloom to help prevent seed production. If blooming has 
<br>already occurred, the plants should either be burned or 
<br>bagged for disposal. A long-sleeve shirt and gloves are 
<br>recommended for protection while pulling blueweed as 
<br>the stiff hairs on the stems and leaves may irritate the 
<br>skin. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">Mowing:</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> Mowing or cutting the plants can help reduce 
<br>seed production on larger infestations in the short term, 
<br>but re-sprouting and production of flowers or seeds below 
<br>the blade level are common. Mowed areas should be 
<br>carefully monitored. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">Tilling:</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> Research in Canada and Europe demonstrated 
<br>that under cultivation blueweed was displaced by other 
<br>plants. However, the disturbance of tillage can create a 
<br>favorable environment for blueweed growth and 
<br>reproduction by reducing competitive perennial plants. 
<br>Tillage should be combined with herbicide management 
<br>and followed by revegetation with desired, competitive 
<br>plants. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:15px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">Irrigation:</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> Blueweed does well under moist conditions 
<br>and therefore irrigation is not recommended as a control 
<br>by itself. Where blueweed invades irrigated pastures and 
<br>hayland, carefully planned irrigation management will 
<br>stimulate the competitiveness of the forage crop and when 
<br>combined with nutrient, forage harvest, and grazing 
<br>management practices will help prevent the re-
<br>establishment of blueweed after other control practices 
<br>are applied. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">Fertilization: </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Blueweed does well on soils with low 
<br>fertility. Also, flowering of blueweed is reduced under 
<br>high nutrient conditions. On cultivated pastures and hay 
<br>meadows, nutrient management is important to 
<br>maintaining the competitiveness of desired perennial 
<br>grasses. Nutrient management combined with judicious 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">use of herbicides and crop rotation is recommended where 
<br>blueweed invades non-native pastures and hay meadows. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">Prescribed burning:</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> No specific information is available 
<br>for prescribed fire effects on blueweed. Although 
<br>flowering plants may be burned to control seed 
<br>production and distribution, large-scale burning could 
<br>create a disturbed environment favorable to blueweed and 
<br>other invasive plant species. Areas within a prescribed 
<br>burn where blueweed has invaded should be monitored 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">and treated with herbicides where necessary. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">Grazing management:</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> No information was found on 
<br>grazing management of blueweed. Generally blueweed is 
<br>avoided by large herbivores because of the stiff hairs on

<br>maintain grazing land health will help prevent new 
<br>populations of blueweed and reestablishment of 
<br>populations after control measures are applied. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">Biological control:</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> Currently, there are no biological 
<br>control agents approved for management of blueweed. 
<br>There are three North American insect species known to 
<br>feed on the species: a lace bug (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">Dictyla echii</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> Schrank), 
<br>moth (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">Ethmia bipunctella</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> Fabricus), and chrysomelid 
<br>beetle (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">Longitarsus melanurus</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> Melsheimer). These 
<br>insects are not known to occur in the Northwest United 
<br>States. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">Revegetation:</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> Blueweed is not shade tolerant and is 
<br>seldom found on closed vegetative communities. 
<br>Disturbance is favorable to blueweed and removal of 
<br>natural vegetation provides opportunities for 
<br>establishment. Revegetation of disturbances is therefore 
<br>important to prevent blueweed invasion.
