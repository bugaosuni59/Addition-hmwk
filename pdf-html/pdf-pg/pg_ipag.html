<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">General</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">: Phlox Family (Polemoniaceae). Scarlet gilia is a biennial to 
<br>short-lived perennial forb arising from a basal rosette and taproot.  
<br>Individual plants remain in rosette form for one to many years and 
<br>typically die after flowering (Fertig, 2017).  The Scarlet gilia’s 
<br>lifespan varies, but one study found an average lifespan of 4.8 years 
<br>with no plants surviving after ten years (Campbel, 1997).  In 
<br>production trials conducted at Rocky Mountain Research Station, the 
<br>proportion of plants behaving as biennials was approximately 99%. A 
<br>very few were noted as possibly carrying over to the following year, 
<br>but those may have been seed that germinated a year later (Jensen, 
<br>2017). Mature plants can reach as much as 1 m (3 ft) tall, but plants 
<br>typically range from 0.5 to 0.6 m (18 to 24 in) in height. The basal 
<br>leaves are 2 to 8 cm (0.8 to 3.1 in) long and highly pinnatifid with 
<br>narrow segments. The stem leaves reduce further up the stem. The 
<br>flowers are typically scarlet as in varieties </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">aggregata</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">, </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">arizonica</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> and

<br>Flowers are long tubular (1.5 to 5 cm long) with five spreading petals. 
<br>The fruit is a 5 to 10 mm (0.2 to 0.4 in) capsule bearing 1 to several, 2 to 4 mm long seeds. As is typical in the phlox family, 
<br>the seeds become mucilaginous (slimy) when wet (Welsh et al., 2003). Jensen (2017) reported that from 36 collections, seed 
<br>weights ranged from 280,000 to 700,000 seeds/lb.

<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Scarlet gilia is typically found in sunny openings in mountain shrub, 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">sagebrush steppe, and alpine timber communities from 1,100 to 3,300 m 
<br>(3,600 to 10,800 ft) elevations in the Sierra, Intermountain and Rocky 
<br>Mountain regions (Hickman, 1993; Welsh et al., 2003).  It is very drought 
<br>tolerant, shade intolerant, and has higher germination success and seedling 
<br>survival in disturbed soils (Juenger and Bergelson, 2000).  Scarlet gilia 
<br>prefers medium to coarse loam to sandy loam soils in areas receiving 250 
<br>to 1,000 mm (10 to 40 in) mean annual precipitation.

<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Wildlife</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">: Scarlet gilia can be included in conservation and wildlife habitat plantings to increase species diversity. Plants are 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">highly palatable, with the flowering stocks regularly utilized by native wildlife and livestock (Fertig, 2017).  The timing of 
<br>herbivory can influence plant response, with overcompensation (increased flower and seed production compared to non-
<br>grazed plants) observed with early season herbivory and reduced flowers and seed production with late season herbivory 
<br>(Paige and Whitham, 1987; Paige 1999).

Scarlet gilia typically flowers in early- to mid-summer depending on the region. In 
<br>the Intermountain and Rocky Mountain West, flowering dates ranged from April to July (Jensen, 2017). Flowers are self-
<br>incompatible and rely on cross pollination for seed production (Wolf et al 1986).  
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Status 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Please consult the PLANTS Web site (http://plants.usda.gov/) and your state’s Department of Natural Resources for this 
<br>plant’s current status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:54px; top:1035px; width:504px; height:588px;"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Planting Guidelines 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Based on a seeding rate of 50 pure live seeds (PLS) per foot, the full stand seeding rate is approximately 6 lbs/ac. The 
<br>seeding rate should be adjusted to match the desired percentage within a seed mixture. Seed can be planted with a drill or 
<br>broadcast seeder. Very shallow seeding depths, on the surface to no more than 3 mm (1/8 in) are typically recommended; 
<br>however, Jensen (2017) observed no differences in emergence when planted at depths between 1.5 and 4 cm. Juenger and 
<br>Bergelson (2000) found that tilling prior to broadcast seeding increased establishment significantly.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br>Management 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Scarlet gilia should be used as a minor component of pollinator and restoration seed mixtures.  Management strategies should 
<br>be based on the key species in the established plant community.  Grazing should be deferred on seeded lands for at least two 
<br>growing seasons to allow for full stand establishment (Ogle et al., 2011).   
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Environmental Concerns 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Scarlet gilia is native to western North America. It does not pose any environmental concern to native plant communities 
<br>under proper management.  
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Seed Production 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Seed collection dates for Intermountain West populations ranged from the last week of June through the last week of 
<br>September (Jensen, 2017). Small scale production fields and wildland collections can be harvested by beating the seeds off 
<br>the plant into a bin or bag, or by clipping the flower heads. Small amounts can be dried in paper bags at room temperature 
<br>with the top of the bag covered with open weave cloth. Larger amounts are dried on tarps in a greenhouse or shed. Plants are 
<br>covered with garden row cover to prevent seed loss from the potentially explosive dehiscence of the capsule (Skinner, 2007). 
<br>Seed is cleaned by running the collected material through an air-screen cleaner. Clean seed is stored in controlled conditions 
<br>at 40 degrees Fahrenheit and 20 to 40% relative humidity.  
<br> 
<br>There are many issues preventing scarlet gilia from being adopted into large scale seed production. Scarlet gilia is usually 
<br>considered a biennial, but may remain in the rosette stage for several years before flowering and is probably more properly 
<br>considered a monocarpic perennial (Skinner, 2007). Because the plants flower indeterminately and the capsules dehisce 
<br>forcefully upon ripening, a single harvest is inefficient for gathering a significant amount of seed. Multiple hand harvests are 
<br>difficult and time-consuming. There is wide variation in seed size depending mostly on pollinator effectiveness and therefore 
<br>the number of seeds set per capsule (Wolf et al 1986). Shock et al (2014) reported yields of 47, 61 and 64 lbs/acre from a 
<br>single harvest with 0, 4 and 8 inches supplemental precipitation respectively (Shock et al., 2015). Rocky Mountain Research 
<br>Station observed yields of 25, 87, 110 lbs/acre extrapolated from production beds from multiple harvests (Jensen, 2017). 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Field observations suggest browsing scarlet gilia plants resulted in bushier canopies with increased flower numbers (Paige 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">and Whitham, 1987; Paige 1999). However, Jensen et al (2011) showed clipping treatments conducted in June and July 
<br>resulted in approximate fourfold reduction in the number of flowers as compared to the control plants. A second set of trials 
<br>looking at earlier clipping dates (beginning in April) again showed no overcompensation among any treatments (Jensen, 
<br>2017).  
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Plant Production 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Seed from montane Oregon germinated poorly under all conditions (Link 1993); however, Rose et al (1998) reported that no 
<br>pretreatment is necessary for germination. Skinner (2007) found best results (90% emergence) with 45 days of cold moist 
<br>stratification for a seed collection from Paradise Creek drainage near Pullman, Washington. Unpublished data from trials 
<br>conducted at the Pullman Plant Materials Center showed that 5% emergence occurred without stratification and that 90 or 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">more days of cold, moist stratification did not increase emergence beyond that achieved with 45 days. Slightly higher 
<br>emergence was obtained from plants grown outdoors under cool, fluctuating growing conditions but these plants were not 
<br>ready to be transplanted to the field the same spring (Skinner, 2007).  
<br> 
<br>Greenhouse transplant production can take four months and should be started in late November or early December.  Seed can 
<br>be sown into 10 cubic inch conetainers filled with a standard soil mix and covered lightly. A thin layer of pea gravel or sand

Conetainers should be 
<br>watered deeply and placed outside before being moved to the greenhouse in early to mid-January. Alternately, seed can be 
<br>moist stratified in a refrigerator for 45 days before sowing in the greenhouse.  Emergence may begin in four to eight days and 
<br>it may take two weeks for the seedling to become established.  Once established, the plant enters and active growing phase 
<br>and should remain in the green house for three months.  Watering deeply should occur daily and a water soluble fertilizer 
<br>should be added weekly.  Hardening can take place in late March or early April depending on the weather.  Plants can be 
<br>moved into a cold frame and watered every other day when cool, every day when hot.  Hardening may take two to four weeks 
<br>and the plant should be ready for transplant by early May (Skinner, 2007).  
<br> 
<br>Stem cuttings can be propagated in a frame (Mirov &amp; Kraebel 1939).
