<br>protein levels can be as high as 18 percent and 
<br>decrease to about 4 percent as it matures.  Digestible  
<br>carbohydrates remain high throughout the active

<br>forage by cattle and horses, but protein supplements 
<br>are required to ensure good animal health.  It is noted 
<br>for its ability to withstand very heavy grazing 
<br>pressure (65-70 percent utilization), once stands are 
<br>established.  Crested wheatgrass is a good forage 
<br>producer in the areas where best adapted.  Crested 
<br>wheatgrass is generally not recommended above 12-
<br>14 inches of precipitation, because better, alternative 
<br>forage species are available.  Crested wheatgrass 
<br>stands generally produce from 1.5 to 2 times more

<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Erosion control/reclamation</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">: Crested wheatgrass is 
<br>well adapted to stabilization of disturbed soils.  It 
<br>competes well with other aggressive introduced 
<br>plants during the establishment period.  Crested 
<br>wheatgrass is not compatible in mixes with native 
<br>species, because it is very competitive and will out-
<br>compete slower developing native species.  Their 
<br>drought tolerance, fibrous root systems, and good 
<br>seedling vigor make these species ideal for 
<br>reclamation in areas receiving 8 to 16 inches annual 
<br>precipitation.  In areas above 14 inches annual 
<br>precipitation, ‘Roadcrest’ and ‘Ephraim’ may exhibit 
<br>their rhizomatous traits and make excellent low 
<br>maintenance lawns when broadcast seeded to 
<br>establish thick lawns.  These grasses can be used in 
<br>urban areas where irrigation water is limited to 
<br>provide ground cover, weed control and to stabilize 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">ditch banks, dikes, pipelines, power lines, and

<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Wildlife</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">: Birds and small rodents eat crested 
<br>wheatgrass seeds.  Deer, antelope, and elk graze it, 
<br>especially in spring and fall.  Upland and songbirds 
<br>utilize stands for nesting.  Where it is planted as a 
<br>monoculture, the resulting biodiversity is lower than 
<br>that found in a diverse plant community.

<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">General</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">: Grass Family (Poaceae).  It is a long-lived, 
<br>cool season, drought tolerant, introduced, and winter 
<br>hardy grass with an extensive root system.  Related 
<br>species include the following: Desert wheatgrass 
<br>(</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Agropyron desertorum</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">) and Siberian wheatgrass 
<br>(</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Agropyron fragile</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">). 
<br> 
<br>Spike 2 to 7 cm long.  The spikelets more widely 
<br>spreading with the glumes somewhat contoured, 
<br>gradually tapering into awns 2 to 5 mm long.  
<br>Fairway or crested wheatgrass has short-broad spikes 
<br>that taper at the top, smaller seeds, grows shorter, and 
<br>has finer leaves and stems than desert wheatgrass.   
<br>Desert wheatgrass has longer spikes than fairway, but 
<br>vary in spike shape from comb-like to oblong.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Fairway and desert grow from 1 to 3 feet tall with 
<br>seed spikes 1.5 to 3 inches long.  Spikelets are 
<br>flattened, closely overlapping, oriented at a slight 
<br>angle on the rachis.  The lemmas are linear-lanceolate 
<br>narrowing to a short awn.  Glumes are awl shaped 
<br>and firm, and keeled.  Culms are erect.  Leaves are 
<br>flat, smooth below, slightly scabrous (coarse) above 
<br>and vary in width from 2 to 6 mm.  Siberian is very 
<br>similar to fairway and desert, but has finer leaves and 
<br>stems, narrower and awnless glumes and lemmas, 
<br>and the spikelets are more ascending, which gives the 
<br>spike a narrow, oblong, sub-cylindrical shape.  
<br>Siberian is more droughts tolerant and retains its 
<br>greenness and palatability later into the summer than 
<br>either desert or fairway.

<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Distribution 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">This species was introduced from Asia and is 
<br>naturalized from the Pacific coast to New York.  For 
<br>current distribution, please consult the Plant Profile

<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Establishment 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Crested wheatgrass should be seeded with a drill at a 
<br>depth of 1/2 inch or less on medium to fine textured 
<br>soils and 1 inch or less on coarse textured soils.  
<br>Single species seeding rates recommended for crested 
<br>wheatgrass and its close relatives are 5-7 pounds Pure 
<br>Live Seed (PLS) per acre or 20 to 30 PLS per square 
<br>foot.  Single species seeding rates recommended for 
<br>Siberian wheatgrass is 6-8 pounds PLS per acre or 
<br>24-30 PLS per square foot.  If used as a component 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">of a mix, with alfalfa (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Medicago</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> spp.), sainfoin

<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:323px; top:962px; width:218px; height:634px;"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">seeding rate should be increased to 10-12 pounds 
<br>PLS per acre or 40 to 50 PLS per square foot.  
<br>Mulching and light irrigation on highly disturbed, 
<br>droughty areas are beneficial for stand establishment.  
<br> 
<br>The best seeding results are obtained from seeding in 
<br>very early spring on heavy to medium textured soils 
<br>and as dormant seeding in late fall on medium to 
<br>light textured soils.  Late summer (August - mid 
<br>September) seedings are not recommended unless 
<br>irrigation is available. 
<br> 
<br>Crested and Siberian wheatgrasses establish quickly, 
<br>with ‘Hycrest’ and ‘Vavilov’ noted for their seedling 
<br>vigor.  They should not be seeded with native 
<br>species, unless seeding rates are very low (&lt; 2 
<br>pounds per acre).  They may compliment native 
<br>stands that are already partially established.  Under 
<br>favorable conditions they are good weed barriers. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br>Stands may require weed control measures during 
<br>establishment, but application of 2,4-D should not be 
<br>made until plants have reached the four to six leaf 
<br>stages.  Mow when weeds are beginning to bloom to 
<br>reduce weed seed development.  Grasshoppers and 
<br>other insects may also damage new stands and use of 
<br>pesticides may be required. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Adaptation</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">: Crested wheatgrass is adapted for non-
<br>irrigated seedings, where annual precipitation 
<br>averages 8-16 inches or more (fairway should 
<br>average 10 inches or more), and where the frost-free 
<br>period is generally less than 140 days.  Desert and 
<br>hybrid cross are superior above 8 inches annual 
<br>precipitation in spring recovery and grazing 
<br>readiness.  On droughty sites with 7-10 inches annual 
<br>precipitation, Siberian wheatgrass may be the best 
<br>choice.  It is known to surpass desert and hybrid cross 
<br>in rate of establishment, stand persistence, and total 
<br>forage yield on the more arid sites.  Siberian has been 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">seeded in areas with as little as 5 inches of 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">precipitation with some success.  
<br> 
<br>Crested wheatgrass should generally be seeded below 
<br>7,000 feet elevation.  Fairway does well up to 9,000 
<br>feet elevation.  Crested wheatgrass does well on 
<br>shallow to deep, moderately course to fine textured, 
<br>moderately well to well drained soils.  Under saline 
<br>conditions, vigor and production are reduced.  
<br>Fairway is not well adapted to silty soils.  Siberian 
<br>types are well adapted to light-sandy, droughty soils.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">All crested wheatgrasses are cold tolerant and can 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">withstand moderate periodic flooding, not exceeding 
<br>7-10 days in the spring.  They are very tolerant of 
<br>fire.  They will not tolerate long periods of

<div style="position:absolute; top:1734px;"><a name="3">Page 3</a></div>
<div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:1804px; width:218px; height:645px;"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">inundation-standing water, poorly drained soils, or 
<br>excessive irrigation.  
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Management 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Crested wheatgrass produces leaves in the spring 
<br>about 10 days after bluegrass species and about two 
<br>weeks earlier than native wheatgrasses.  They make 
<br>good spring growth, little summer growth and good 
<br>fall growth if moisture is available.  
<br> 
<br>Crested wheatgrass has good palatability for 
<br>livestock and some wildlife.  Livestock and wildlife 
<br>will graze crested wheatgrass throughout the spring 
<br>growing season until it becomes too coarse, and again 
<br>in fall if re-growth occurs.  Established stands can 
<br>withstand very heavy grazing.  
<br> 
<br>New stands of crested wheatgrass should not be 
<br>grazed until they are firmly established and have 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">started to produce seed heads.  Six inches of new 
<br>growth should be attained in spring before grazing is 
<br>allowed in established stands.  Three inches of 
<br>stubble should remain at the end of the grazing 
<br>season to maintain the long-term health of the plant.  
<br>In addition, leaving three inches or more stubble will 
<br>result in a 10 - 14 day earlier growth period or 
<br>“green-up” in spring.   
<br> 
<br>Crested wheatgrass is a low maintenance plant 
<br>requiring little additional treatment or care.  
<br>However, spring/fall deferment or grazing rotations 
<br>are recommended to maintain plant health and to 
<br>maximize forage production potential.  
<br> 
<br>Crested wheatgrass is competitive with weedy 
<br>species, but can be crowded out by some aggressive 
<br>introduced weedy species and native woody species.  
<br> 
<br>Crested wheatgrass can be used for hay production 
<br>and will make nutritious feed, but is more suited to 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">pasture use.  Light infrequent applications of nitrogen 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">(25 pounds/acre) and light irrigation will increase 
<br>total biomass production and lengthen the growing 
<br>period.  Re-growth of crested wheatgrass is slow. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Environmental Concerns</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">: Crested wheatgrass is long-
<br>lived and spreads primarily via seed.  Spread of 
<br>rhizomatous varieties is very slow in the case of the 
<br>‘Roadcrest’ and ‘Ephraim’.  They are not considered 
<br>&quot;weedy&quot; or invasive species.  Most seedings do not 
<br>spread beyond original plantings.  They will cross 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">with each other, but do not cross with native species.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br>Crested wheatgrass resists cheatgrass competition 
<br>better than most native species, because it germinates 
<br>earlier and grows more rapidly at colder 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:306px; top:1767px; width:3px; height:15px;"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:15px"> 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:306px; top:2474px; width:3px; height:15px;"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:15px"> 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:324px; top:1804px; width:218px; height:645px;"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">temperatures.  This has an important competitive 
<br>advantage, when dealing with winter annual species, 
<br>such as cheatgrass.  
<br> 
<br>Full, properly managed stands of crested wheatgrass 
<br>generally exclude native grasses and forbs.  When 
<br>inter-seeded into native stands, crested wheatgrass 
<br>commonly co-exists with native grasses, forbs and 
<br>shrubs.  Some native shrubs, such as big sagebrush 
<br>and rabbitbrush, often invade crested wheatgrass 
<br>stands, especially if native seed sources are nearby. 
<br> 
<br>Due to commonly being planted in monocultures 
<br>(single species) stands in the past, some feel crested 
<br>wheatgrass is not ecologically appropriate.  It is 
<br>important to consider the paragraph above and to 
<br>plant multiple species mixes to avoid this perception. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Seed Production 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Seed production of crested wheatgrasses has been 
<br>very successful under cultivated conditions.  Row 
<br>spacing of 24 to 30 inches when irrigated and 36 
<br>inches or greater under dryland conditions are 
<br>recommended.  Early spring or late fall seedings are 
<br>recommended under dryland conditions.  Early spring 
<br>seedings are recommended under irrigated 
<br>conditions.  When irrigated, spring seedings 
<br>consistently yield more seed during the first year of 
<br>seed production.  To obtain maximum seed 
<br>production, fall plantings are not recommended. 
<br> 
<br>Control weeds during stand establishment and long 
<br>term management of stand by clipping, hand rouging 
<br>or light rates of herbicide (2,4-D or Bromoxynil 
<br>according to label) after the five-leaf stage.  Fertilizer 
<br>is generally not recommended during establishment.  
<br>If soil nitrogen and phosphorus are low, an 
<br>application of 10-15 pounds per acre nitrogen and 20-
<br>30 pounds per acre phosphorus may be applied prior 
<br>to planting.  Fertilize for full seed production 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">following the establishment year in early fall or use a 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">split application in early fall and again in early 
<br>spring.  Very early spring application of nitrogen may

<br> 
<br>'Douglas' was developed by ARS in Logan, Utah and 
<br>released in 1994 in cooperation with the Utah 
<br>Agricultural Experiment Station and NRCS.  The 
<br>breeding populations were derived from accessions 
<br>originating in the former USSR, Iran, and Turkey.  
<br>One accession was characterized with very broad

<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">crosses.  Douglas has larger seed than other crested 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">wheatgrasses and has excellent seedling vigor.  It 
<br>produces less forage than other cultivars, but is 
<br>leafier and remains green longer into the growing 
<br>season suggesting improved forage preference and 
<br>improved fire resistance.  Douglas requires 13-14 
<br>inches or more annual precipitation.  It is not 
<br>recommended for turf applications, but may work
