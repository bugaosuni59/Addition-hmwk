<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Fourwing saltbush is a polymorphic species varying 
<br>from deciduous to evergreen, depending on climate. 
<br>Its much-branched stems are stout with whitish bark. 
<br>Mature plants range from 1 to over 8 feet in height, 
<br>depending on ecotype and the soil and climate. Its 
<br>leaves are simple, alternate, entire, linear-spatulate to 
<br>narrowly oblong, canescent (covered with fine 
<br>whitish hairs) and ½ to 2 inches long. Its root system 
<br>is branched and commonly very deep (to 20 feet) 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">when soil depth allows. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:324px; top:603px; width:218px; height:128px;"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Fourwing saltbush is mostly dioecious, with male and 
<br>female flowers on separate plants. Male flowers are 
<br>red to yellow and form dense spikes at the ends of the 
<br>branches. The female flowers are axillary and 
<br>nondescript. However, some monecious plants may 
<br>be found within a population. Fourwing saltbush 
<br>plants can exhibit hermaphroditic characteristics 
<br>(male and female parts in one flower). The seed is 
<br>contained in utricles that turn a dull yellow when ripe 
<br>and may remain attached to the plant throughout 
<br>winter.

<br>native shrubs on rangelands in the western United 
<br>States including the Intermountain, Great Basin, and 
<br>Great Plains regions. Its natural range extends from 
<br>below sea level to above 8,000 feet elevation.  For 
<br>current distribution, consult the Plant Profile page for

<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Fourwing saltbush is adapted to most soils but is best 
<br>suited to deep, well drained; loamy to sandy to 
<br>gravely soils. It is sometimes found growing in dense 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">clay soils. It is very tolerant of saline soil conditions 
<br>and somewhat tolerant of sodic soil conditions. 
<br>Under saline conditions plants take up salts and 
<br>accumulate it in the plants scurfy leaf coverings.  
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:1238px; width:214px; height:82px;"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Fourwing saltbush has high tolerance to boron. It 
<br>does not tolerate high water tables or late winter 
<br>inundation. It is extremely drought tolerant and has 
<br>fair shade tolerance. It is not very tolerant of fire, but 
<br>may resprout to some degree if fire intensity is not 
<br>too severe. Its ability to tolerate extreme cold 
<br>conditions varies with ecotype.

<br>that receive 8 to 14 inches annual precipitation. It can 
<br>be found from sea level to 8,000 feet elevation. 
<br>Depending on ecotype, fourwing saltbush grows in 
<br>association with bluebunch wheatgrass, basin 
<br>wildrye, bottlebrush squirreltail, Indian ricegrass, 
<br>Sandberg bluegrass, sand dropseed, blue grama, 
<br>galleta, black grama, alkali sacaton, inland saltgrass,

<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Planting:</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> Fourwing saltbush begins growth in mid to 
<br>late spring. Seed matures 3 to 4 months after 
<br>flowering. It typically spreads via seed distribution, 
<br>but may also root sprout following wildfire or layer if 
<br>covered with sand. Stands typically take three to four 
<br>years to establish, but once established the plants are 
<br>fairly competitive with other species. Fourwing 
<br>saltbush can be established by transplanting in early 
<br>spring, direct seeding in late fall, early winter or very 
<br>early spring. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:324px; top:962px; width:217px; height:162px;"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">An adapted cultivar/release or local seed source 
<br>should be used to ensure the ecotype is compatible 
<br>with the site. Seed should be after-ripened for ten 
<br>months and dewinged prior to planting.  On moist 
<br>fine soils, seed should be planted ½ inch deep. On 
<br>sandy to coarse gravely soils, plant up to ¾ inch 
<br>deep. Seeding rates of 0.25 to 0.50 pounds per acre is 
<br>recommended for rangeland seeding mixtures (3 to 7 
<br>percent of the seeding mix). Dewinged seed is 
<br>preferred because seed flow through a drill and 
<br>planting depth can be controlled more easily. There is 
<br>no prechilling requirement for fourwing saltbush 
<br>seed. See Seed Production section for additional 
<br>planting recommendations 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:324px; top:1134px; width:206px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Seedling vigor is generally outstanding and 
<br>depending on ecotype, young plants may reach 
<br>heights of 18 inches by the end of the first growing 
<br>season. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:324px; top:1192px; width:217px; height:59px;"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Management 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Fourwing saltbush is palatable to cattle, sheep and 
<br>deer season long. It provides nutritious winter browse 
<br>on many areas and is a good fall and winter browse 
<br>plant for bighorn sheep, antelope, and elk. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:324px; top:1261px; width:218px; height:162px;"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">In new plantings, utilizing good seedbed and weed 
<br>control techniques should enhance establishment and 
<br>reduce competition with other plants. In interseedings 
<br>plant competition should be reduced by chemical, 
<br>scalping, furrowing or other techniques that help 
<br>control existing vegetation and weeds. Animals 
<br>utilizing the area should be removed from new 
<br>plantings for at least two growing seasons or until 
<br>plants are well established and reproducing. Irrigation 
<br>may be needed for transplants on harsh sites to ensure 
<br>establishment. Young seedings are not tolerant of 
<br>excessive insect, rabbit, and rodent damage and 
<br>plantings may require control measures if severe 
<br>damage appears. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:324px; top:1433px; width:214px; height:116px;"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">In established plantings, deferred rotation grazing 
<br>systems are recommended for fourwing saltbush 
<br>management. Plants can be grazed from late spring 
<br>through winter, but plant health is best maintained if 
<br>used primarily as a winter browse.  Fourwing 
<br>saltbush tolerates browsing very well, but will 
<br>decrease in abundance under continuous close 
<br>browsing. Proper use of fourwing saltbush as browse 
<br>is approximately 40 - 50 percent of current year’s 
<br>growth. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:324px; top:1560px; width:215px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Excessive use results in damage or loss of plants 
<br>from breakage of brittle branches. During dry 
<br>periods, branches and stems may be brittle and

<br>be reduced until fully recovered. No injury to 
<br>livestock results from grazing this plant. However, it 
<br>can cause bloat and scours in spring if it is the 
<br>primary dietary source. Rabbits, rodents, and 
<br>grasshoppers utilize fourwing saltbush and may 
<br>damage stands under severe conditions requiring pest

<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Fourwing saltbush is native, long-lived, and spreads 
<br>primarily by seed distribution. It is not considered 
<br>&quot;weedy&quot;, but could slowly spread into adjoining 
<br>vegetative communities under ideal climatic and 
<br>environmental conditions. This species is well 
<br>documented as having beneficial qualities and no 
<br>negative impacts on wild or domestic animals. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:2011px; width:215px; height:70px;"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Seed Production 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Establishing plants in a greenhouse and transplanting 
<br>to the field will result in the most satisfactory stands 
<br>for seed production. (Note: studies are underway to 
<br>determine the feasibility or success of propagating 
<br>fourwing saltbush from stem cuttings) 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:71px; top:2091px; width:217px; height:105px;"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Plant spacing should be 6 to 8 feet within row and 8 
<br>to 10 feet between rows. Planting one male plant for 
<br>every 5 female plants is recommended. Transplanting 
<br>into weed barrier fabric can also improve plant 
<br>establishment, seed production, weed control, and 
<br>moisture conservation. Transplanting is 
<br>recommended in the spring prior to summer heat. 
<br>Full seed production is usually reached the third year 
<br>following transplanting. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:2206px; width:215px; height:105px;"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Plantings can also be established with seed. A 
<br>minimum of 15 to 20 Pure Live seeds per linear foot 
<br>of drill row should be planted.  Hand seeding in late 
<br>fall or very early spring may also be an option.  Plant 
<br>5 to 10 seeds in a close group at desired spacing.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Thin plants to desired spacing and ratio of male to 
<br>female plants when fruiting starts (about 3 years). 
<br>Full seed production may be reached the fourth year 
<br>following direct seeding. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:2321px; width:214px; height:128px;"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Fourwing saltbush requires an equivalent of 10 to 14 
<br>inches annual precipitation for seed production. 
<br>Irrigation may only be needed for establishment and 
<br>during drought years to ensure a seed crop.  If 
<br>irrigation is available, irrigate to promote vegetative 
<br>growth.  Make sure soil moisture is adequate at early 
<br>flowering, during seed set and early maturation.  
<br>Irrigate to field capacity prior to fall freeze-up. 
<br>Expected seed yields may range from 200 to 400 
<br>pounds per acre.  Fertilization is not generally 
<br>recommended unless soil tests indicate severe 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:324px; top:1804px; width:204px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">nutrient deficiencies.  Rabbits and rodents can 
<br>damage stands and may destroy seedlings.  Insects 
<br>such as grasshoppers and Mormon crickets 
<br>infrequently damage stands beyond recovery. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:324px; top:1861px; width:217px; height:128px;"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Seed generally ripens in late August and September 
<br>and can be harvested from mid September through 
<br>December.  Harvesting seed is best accomplished for 
<br>woody ecotypes by hand stripping. Mechanized 
<br>harvesting has been used on Wytana, but seed 
<br>requires additional conditioning to properly dry and 
<br>clean out excessive trash (leaves, stems, other inert 
<br>matter). Harvested seed is usually threshed 
<br>(dewinged) by processing seed through a hammermill 
<br>(1500 rpm) equipped with a ¼ inch screen and then 
<br>running seed through a fanmill to the desired grade. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:324px; top:1999px; width:217px; height:116px;"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Dewinging may hasten after-ripening of seed 
<br>resulting in shorter viability of seed.  Seed can be 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">stored and remain viable for 6 to 10 years. The 
<br>dewinging process greatly enhances the ability of the 
<br>seed to flow through planting equipment.  Removing 
<br>the hull that surrounds the embryo can injure the seed 
<br>resulting in reduced viability, seedling vigor, and 
<br>stand establishment.  One must be extremely careful
