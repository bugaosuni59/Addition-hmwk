<br>the Hoolehua Plant Materials Center from the 
<br>Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Plant Introduction 
<br>Station in Griffin, Georgia. Several official germination 
<br>tests of 400 seeds per sample were conducted by the State 
<br>of Hawaii Department of Agriculture in 1993 and 1994 on 
<br>seeds harvested from observational plantings at Hoolehua, 
<br>Hawaii and Barrigada, Guam. A seed germinated in one 
<br>of the tests; however, the seedling did not survive after 
<br>being transplanted from the blotters to soil and taken from 
<br>the germinator to the greenhouse. In 1993, an unofficial 
<br>test was also conducted by the Hawaii Department of 
<br>Agriculture with 100 seeds in a vermiculite substratum 
<br>and one seed germinated, but it did not survive for more 
<br>than a week. For approximately the past 15 years, no 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">volunteer seedlings have been observed from 
<br>conservation plantings of Sunshine in the Pacific Islands 
<br>Area. Sunshine was evaluated for invasiveness by the 
<br>Hawaii-Pacific Weed Risk Assessment and Pacific Island 
<br>Ecosystems at Risk. It received a low risk score (-8) for 
<br>the potential to become invasive.

<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">Erosion control</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">: A vegetative barrier is a dense hedge or 
<br>row of plants growing on or near the contour. 
<br>Vetivergrass is well adapted to the vegetative barrier 
<br>practice used to control erosion on farm land because of 
<br>its strong, compact root system and numerous stiff stems. 
<br>The stiff stems slow the movement of the silt-laden 
<br>runoff, spreading it out, trapping sediment, and causing 
<br>deposition of the silt behind the barrier. Slowing of the 
<br>runoff allows more water to infiltrate into the soil. Water 
<br>infiltration is also aided by the deep root system of the 
<br>grass. Over time, a natural terrace-like bench is formed 
<br>behind the barrier.  
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">The standard minimum barrier width of a vegetative 
<br>barrier for the Vegetative Barrier Practice (Conservation 
<br>Practice Code 601) to reduce sheet and rill erosion and 
<br>manage water flow is 36 inches. The Pacific Islands Area 
<br>received a variance from the standard minimum width of 
<br>36 inches to 12 inches when using vetivergrass for 
<br>vegetative barriers. Sunshine vetivergrass, when planted 
<br>in a single row at the correct within-row spacing and with 
<br>proper care, will form a functional vegetative barrier, 12 
<br>inches wide at a height of 6 inches, within one growing 
<br>season. A minimum amount of crop land is devoted to 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">these single-row vegetative barriers and there is minimal 
<br>competition with the crop plants because the root system 
<br>grows essentially straight down.

<br>Vetivergrass is adapted to the tropics and subtropics. It is 
<br>native to the tropical and subtropical areas of the Indian 
<br>Subcontinent (India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka) and Indo-China 
<br>(Indochina, Myanmar, Thailand). In the United States, 
<br>vetivergrass is adapted to the USDA Plant Hardiness 
<br>Zones 9 to 11. It is adapted throughout the Pacific Islands 
<br>and Caribbean Areas. In Hawaii, where farmers grow 
<br>crops over a wide range of elevations, vetivergrass 
<br>appears to be adapted from sea level to about 4,000 feet. 
<br>However, in trials at locations above 2,000 feet it had 
<br>slower growth and a lower rooting percentage of slips.  
<br>Established vetivergrass plants have been known to 
<br>persist in areas with annual rainfall from approximately 
<br>20 to 200 inches. Below 35 inches they may need 
<br>supplemental moisture, particularly during extended dry 
<br>seasons. Vetivergrass will grow on a wide variety of soils 
<br>from sands to sandy loams and clays. It will grow on 
<br>strongly acid to slightly alkaline soils with a pH range 
<br>from 4 to 7.5; however, it prefers neutral to slightly 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">alkaline soils. It tolerates saline soils and a range of heavy 
<br>metals in the soil.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Bold; font-size:13px"> 
<br>Establishment </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br>Planting may be done either by hand or by a machine 
<br>similar to the tractor mounted mechanical transplanters 
<br>used to plant vegetable seedlings. Young plants are not 
<br>shade tolerant and should be planted in a weed-free 
<br>seedbed in full sun. The plantlets or slips must develop 
<br>new roots and, therefore, must be kept moist until they 
<br>have a good root system and are well established. The 
<br>time of planting should be scheduled during the rainy 
<br>season or irrigation provided. Drip irrigation works well 
<br>with a drip line for each row or barrier. Anchor the drip 
<br>tubing 12 to 18 inches to the upslope side of the row, so it 
<br>doesn’t become entangled in the grass clumps as this may 
<br>cause the tubing to constrict and reduce the flow of water. 
<br>Prior to planting, keep the slips in the shade and do not 
<br>allow them to become dry.  
<br> 
<br>Fertilize according to soil test results and 
<br>recommendations. In some locations, a soil test with 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">fertilizer recommendations may be difficult to obtain. In 
<br>lieu of a soil test, a general fertilizer recommendation is 
<br>6.5 pounds of 15-15-15 or similar fertilizer per 100 feet of 
<br>row. To prevent fertilizer burn, apply the fertilizer in 
<br>narrow bands 2 to 3 inches to the side and 1 to 2 inches 
<br>below the slips. Alternatively, apply the fertilizer before 
<br>planting the slips. Spread it evenly over the soil in a band 
<br>36 inches wide and thoroughly till it into the soil. 
<br>Fertilizer is very important for normal growth, especially 
<br>in infertile soils</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Bold; font-size:13px">. </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Calcium in the form of lime and gypsum 
<br>has also been shown to enhance growth.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br>Plant the slips 3 to 4 inches apart in the row. In fertile 
<br>soils, or if well-rooted plants are used, they may be 
<br>planted up to 6 inches apart. Double rows, with the plants 
<br>staggered and spaced 3 to 6 inches within the row by 6 
<br>inches between rows, may be necessary in highly eroded

<br>will give more height to the planting, as well as a place 
<br>for water to flow or pond until the barrier establishes. 
<br>Deposition will take place upslope of the barrier, so 
<br>installers need to be aware of how deposition will affect 
<br>ponding and flow of water by the barrier. Plants can back 
<br>up water 12 to 18 inches, so installers need to be aware of 
<br>overflow and flow to point and provide protection for 
<br>these areas. When planting vegetative barriers, follow the 
<br>procedures outlined in the Vegetative Barrier (601) 
<br>Conservation Practice Standard and Jobsheet.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Bold; font-size:13px"> 
<br>Management </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br>Irrigate and fertilize as needed and control weeds. It’s 
<br>important to properly care for the plants until they are 
<br>completely closed-in and well established. The critical 
<br>period for maintenance is usually during the first year. It’s 
<br>very important to replace dead plants as soon as possible 
<br>as there should be no gaps in the barrier at the end of the 
<br>first year. A vegetative barrier is not completely effective 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">unless the plants have grown together and there are no 
<br>gaps. When planting to fill in gaps, a new line of slips can 
<br>be planted on the sun side of the original planting. 
<br>Replacement slips planted in the same spot as the dead 
<br>plants may be shaded by adjacent plants. If this occurs, 
<br>the adjacent plants must be trimmed to prevent shading of 
<br>the new slips. Trimming to a height of 15 to 20 inches 
<br>when the plants reach a height of 4 feet will promote the 
<br>development of new tillers.  
<br> 
<br>With proper care, the plants should reach their maximum 
<br>height after one year’s growth. After the first year, annual 
<br>trimming to a height of 15 to 20 inches is needed. 
<br>Trimming can be done by hand with a hedge clippers, a 
<br>powered hedge trimmer, or a tractor mounted sickle bar or 
<br>disc mower. The trimmings can be placed along the 
<br>barrier to control weeds, help trap sediment and slow 
<br>water, or they can be used to mulch the adjacent crop 
<br>plants. Trimming will help prevent dead centers from 
<br>forming in the grass clumps, reduce the severity of leaf 
<br>diseases, and prevent a stem bending down into moist soil 
<br>and rooting at a node. This can happen occasionally and 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">the new plant that develops will cause the barrier to 
<br>widen. When done purposely, this method of propagation 
<br>is called layering and can be used to advantage when 
<br>there is a gap between plants that needs to be filled.  
<br> 
<br>Maintenance applications of fertilizer may be needed on 
<br>infertile and shallow soils. Fertilizer can be applied 
<br>broadcast, as a side dressing, or in the irrigation water.  
<br> 
<br>The plants produce tillers and the row will gradually 
<br>widen. Close tilling parallel to the vegetative barrier will 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">keep it compact and should be done, so a minimum 
<br>amount of land is taken out of crop production. Protect 
<br>new plantings from grazing as domestic animals and 
<br>wildlife will browse the grass in its early stages of 
<br>growth. Vetivergrass is tolerant of fire and controlled 
<br>burning can be used as a management tool to reduce the

<br>Vetivergrass is relatively pest-free and is resistant to root-
<br>knot nematodes (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">Meloidogyne </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">spp.). However, it is 
<br>susceptible to attack by certain insects and diseases.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px"> 
<br>Insects</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">: Stem borers (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">Chilo </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">spp.) can attack vetivergrass. 
<br>Stem borers are also a problem on corn, rice, and sugar 
<br>cane in Asia and throughout east and southern Africa. 
<br>This may actually be a potential use for vetivergrass. The 
<br>stem borer moth (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Italic; font-size:13px">Chilo partellus</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">) appears to prefer 
<br>vetivergrass for oviposition but larval survival on 
<br>vetivergrass is quite low. Thus, vetivergrass has the 
<br>potential as a trap crop to concentrate oviposition away 
<br>from the cash crop and reduce subsequent stem borer 
<br>population development. In certain areas, termites will 
<br>attack dead or dying parts of vetivergrass. The “hills” 
<br>created by serious attacks can smother living plants.

<br>American Samoa. The farmer uses the tops to mulch his 
<br>taro. Although the plants have been growing for many 
<br>years and haven’t spread, this strain should not be planted 
<br>on the other islands in American Samoa.  
<br> 
<br>A concern is that people may order vetivergrass plants 
<br>over the internet or by mail order without knowing that 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">fertile strains exist, and accidentally import one of these. 
<br>This is a real concern for most areas. Hawaii is somewhat 
<br>unique in that plants and other vegetative material of 
<br>grasses entering the state must be quarantined for one full 
<br>year in a State of Hawaii Department of Agriculture plant 
<br>quarantine facility. The plants can not be used or out-
<br>planted until after they have been released from 
<br>quarantine.  
<br> 
<br>There is concern that the widespread use of a single clone, 
<br>such as the Sunshine genotype, for conservation plantings 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">could be a problem in the event of an attack by a very 
<br>destructive insect or disease specific to the clone.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,Bold; font-size:13px"> 
<br>Plant Production </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br>For large scale plant production, planting material is 
<br>obtained mainly by splitting up older plants into plantlets 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:355px; top:2166px; width:180px; height:13px;"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">. A short row of a fertile strain was observed

<br>plants should not be much older than 18 months of age. 
<br>After two years, although no viable seed is produced, the 
<br>plants begin to produce a significant amount of seed 
<br>heads. These “seed head” slips do take although slips 
<br>from plants that have not gone to seed generally produce 
<br>new roots faster. Dead material can accumulate in the 
<br>older plants, so cleaning the slips takes longer. In 
<br>addition, older plants are harder to dig. New plantings 
<br>should be scheduled in succession, so the plants being 
<br>harvested are no older than 18 months. In a production 
<br>nursery, the plants can be spaced 12 inches apart within 
<br>the row. The rows can be 36 inches or more apart 
<br>depending on the type of harvesting and planting 
<br>equipment that will be used. For large scale production 
<br>nurseries, the slips can be planted with a tractor mounted 
<br>mechanical transplanter.  
<br> 
<br>A front end loader, with a fork lift or similar attachment, 
<br>or backhoe on a farm tractor can be used to lift the clumps 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">out of the ground. A sharp disk plow or moldboard plow 
<br>can also be used. The plants can also be dug by hand 
<br>using a sharp shovel to cut through the rhizome tissue 
<br>directly around the crown and approximately 4 to 6 inches 
<br>below the surface of the soil. It’s easier to handle the 
<br>harvested material if the tops are trimmed to between 12 
<br>and 20 inches before digging. Separate into individual 
<br>slips with the rhizome tissue intact. Remove dead matter 
<br>and trim the existing roots to approximately 1/2 inch. The 
<br>slips are then cut to a uniform length of about 8 inches, 
<br>washed, and packed for shipment to the planting site.  
<br> 
<br>The slips should be planted within 48 hours after being 
<br>dug up and prepared. They must not be allowed to 
<br>become dry. They are similar to non-rooted cuttings in 
<br>that they must produce new roots from the tissue at the 
<br>base of the slip. Immersing the slips in water for a week 
<br>until new roots start to develop will enhance 
<br>establishment. The water should be changed daily or it 
<br>may become rancid. A similar method of developing new 
<br>roots is planting the slips in a box or bed of moist sand, 
<br>cinders, or potting mix. The growing media should be 6 to 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">8 inches deep. After they have developed a sufficient 
<br>amount of new roots, the slips are easily removed from 
<br>the media, washed, and ready for field planting. The 
<br>preferred method to enhance establishment rate is to grow 
<br>the slips in polyethylene grow bags, dibble tubes, bamboo 
<br>tubes, plastic pots, or similar containers. A novel type of 
<br>container is a modified form of poly bag called planting 
<br>strips. Instead of using individual bags, the slips are 
<br>planted closely in polyethylene plastic lined furrows or 
<br>troughs that are transported intact to the planting site. 
<br>They are used when planting on difficult sites because, 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">since the roots remain together, the survival rate is high. 
<br>After 3 to 6 weeks in containers, the plants should have 
<br>developed an adequate root system and be ready for 
<br>planting in the field.

<br>stem cuttings, and plantlets that develop at the stem 
<br>nodes. Laying or inserting fresh cut pieces of stems or 
<br>culms in moist sand under mist will cause roots and 
<br>shoots to develop at the nodes. Vetivergrass plants that 
<br>haven’t been trimmed will develop aerial plantlets at 
<br>some of the stem nodes. When these are clipped off and 
<br>immersed in water, they will develop new roots similar to 
<br>slips.

<br>Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
<br>of origin) </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br>It is generally accepted that there are basically two types 
<br>of vetivergrass: the wild type from North India and the 
<br>“domesticated” type from South India. The North India 
<br>type produces fertile seed while the South India type is 
<br>essentially sterile. Based on DNA fingerprinting data, it 
<br>appears that almost all the non-fertile cultivars used for 
<br>erosion control outside South Asia have been derived 
<br>from the Sunshine genotype. For example, Sunshine and 
<br>the following cultivars are genetically the same: Boucard, 
<br>Fort Polk, Haiti, Huffman, Monto, and Vallonia.
