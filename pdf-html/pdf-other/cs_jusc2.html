<br>The Cheyennes steeped the leaves of the Rocky 
<br>Mountain juniper and drank the resulting tea to 
<br>relieve persistent coughing or a tickling in the throat.  
<br>It was also believed to produce sedative effects that 
<br>were especially useful for calming a hyperactive 
<br>person.  Cheyenne women drank juniper tea to speed 
<br>delivery during childbirth (Grinnell 1962).  The 
<br>Cheyenne, along with the Flathead, Nez Perce,  
<br>Kutenai, and Sioux, made a tea from juniper boughs, 
<br>branches, and fleshy cones.  The tea was used as a 
<br>cure for colds, fevers, tonsillitis, and pneumonia 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">(Hart 1976). 
<br> 
<br>As a cure for asthma, the Gros Ventres ate whole 
<br>juniper berries or pulverized them and boiled them to 
<br>make a tea.  They also made a preparation from the 
<br>leaves mixed with the root, which they applied 
<br>topically to control bleeding (Kroeber 1908).  The 
<br>Crow drank this medicinal tea to check diarrhea and 
<br>to stop lung or nasal hemorrhage.  Crow women 
<br>drank it after childbirth for cleansing and healing 
<br>(Hart 1976).  
<br> 
<br>The wood of red cedar is very durable, and is used 
<br>for lance shafts, bows, and other items.  Flutes made 
<br>from juniper wood were highly regarded by the 
<br>Cheyenne.

<br>ornamental species, and many horticultural varieties 
<br>have been developed.  Rocky Mountain juniper is 
<br>widely used in shelterbelts and wildlife plantings.  
<br>The close-grained, aromatic, and durable wood of 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">junipers is used for furniture, interior paneling, 
<br>novelties, and fence posts.  The fruits and young

<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Wildlife</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">: Junipers are important to wildlife 
<br>throughout the country.  Their twigs and foliage are 
<br>eaten extensively by hoofed browsers, but the chief 
<br>attraction to wildlife is the bluish-black berry-like 
<br>fruit.  The cedar waxwing is one of the principal 
<br>users of juniper berries, but numerous other birds and 
<br>mammals, both large and small, make these fruits and 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">important part of their diet.  In addition to their

<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">General</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">: Cypress Family (Cupressaceae).  Rocky 
<br>Mountain cedar (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Juniperus scopulorum</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> ) is a medium

<br>crown to pyramidal.  The bark is dark reddish-brown 
<br>to grayish in color, thin, fibrous, and usually shreds 
<br>with age.  Leaves are green or blue-green, usually 
<br>barely overlapping and closely appressed, scalelike 
<br>and 0.2-0.3 cm (1/16-1/8&quot;) long or needlelike and 
<br>0.6-1.2 cm (1/4-1/2&quot;) long.  Recessed glands occur on

<br>Distribution 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Rocky Mountain juniper grows in prairie hillsides, 
<br>fields, pastures, and occasionally in woodlands, in 
<br>rocky, sandy, or clay soils.  The distribution of Rocky 
<br>Mountain juniper is from British Columbia and 
<br>Alberta south through the Great Basin and the Rocky 
<br>Mountains to Arizona and New Mexico and into 
<br>western Texas, north across eastern Colorado, 
<br>western Nebraska to western North Dakota, and west 
<br>in Montana.  The range overlaps that of </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Juniperus

<br>dry areas.  The junipers are generally propagated by 
<br>cuttings.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Propagation from Cuttings 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Cuttings are made 5 to 15 cm (2 to 65 inches) long 
<br>from new lateral growth tips stripped of older 
<br>branches.  A small piece of old wood, a “heel,” is 
<br>thus left attached to the base of the cutting.  Some 
<br>propagators believe this to be advantageous.  In other 
<br>cases, good results are obtained when the cuttings are 
<br>just clipped without the “heel” from the older wood.  
<br>Cuttings from the current season’s terminal growth 
<br>also root well. 
<br> 
<br>Cuttings to be rooted in the greenhouse can be taken 
<br>at any time during the winter or rooted outdoors on 
<br>heated beds.  Exposing the stock plants to several 
<br>hard freezes seems to give better rooting.  Optimum 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">time for taking cuttings is when stock plants have 
<br>ceased growth (i.e. the late fall-winter propagation 
<br>period is more successful than summer).  For 
<br>propagating in an outdoor cold frame, cuttings are 
<br>taken in late summer or early fall.  There may be 
<br>advantages to using bottom heat.  Lightly wounding 
<br>the base of the cuttings is sometimes helpful, and the 
<br>use of root-promoting chemicals, especially IBA, is 
<br>beneficial.  Recommendations for root-promoting 
<br>chemicals include the following: 2500 IBA Quick-
<br>dip (Alabama), 3000 – 8000 ppm IBA liquid, and 
<br>0.3-4.5 percent IBA talc.  A medium-coarse sand or a 
<br>10:1 mixture of perlite and peat moss is a satisfactory 
<br>rooting medium.  Maintenance of a humid 
<br>environment without excessive wetting of the 
<br>cuttings is desirable, as is a relatively high light 
<br>intensity.  A light, intermittent mist can be used.  
<br>Bottom heat of 60-65°F (12°C) is critical the first six 
<br>weeks of propagation to allow the basal wound of 
<br>cuttings to callus. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Seed Propagation 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Juniperus scopulorum</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> flowers from April to June.  
<br>The fruits should be gathered in the fall (September-
<br>October) as soon as the berry-like cones become ripe.  
<br>Rocky Mountain juniper trees come to seed-bearing 
<br>age in 10-20 years, and they bear cones every 2-5 
<br>years.  Seed collection can be done by stripping or 
<br>picking the berries by hand from the trees, or by 
<br>flailing the fruits to ground cloths.  Be careful to pick 
<br>only ripe berries.  Since the number of filled seeds 
<br>varies widely from tree to tree, it is important to test 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">the seeds by cutting to determine percent fill.  Seeds 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">may be stored as berries or cleaned seeds. 
<br> 
<br>The seeds can be recovered by macerating the fruits 
<br>and floating the seeds to the top.  The addition of

<br>seeds from the resinous fruits.  Juniper seeds store 
<br>quite well.  They should be dried to 10-20% moisture 
<br>and stored in a sealed container at cold temperatures. 
<br> 
<br>For best germination, seeds should be removed from 
<br>the fruits, then the seed coat is softened by treating it 
<br>with sulfuric acid for 120 minutes.  After soaking the 
<br>seeds in sulfuric acid, follow with 6 weeks of warm 
<br>stratification at 20 to 30°C (70 to 85°F), or summer 
<br>planting, then 10 weeks of pre-chilling at 4°C (40°F).  
<br>Use of fresh seed reduced the warm stratification 
<br>time.  Rather than the acid treatment, two to three 
<br>months of warm stratification could be used.  As an 
<br>alternative for cold stratification, the seed may be 
<br>sown in the fall.  Germination is delayed at 
<br>temperatures above 15°C (60° F).  Germination is 
<br>often delayed in juniper seeds, as seeds are 
<br>consistently highly dormant.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br>Juniper seeds are usually sown in the nursery in the 
<br>late summer or fall, but may be sown in spring or 
<br>summer.  The seeds of most species should be sown 
<br>in fall to take advantage of natural pre-chilling. 
<br> 
<br>Juniper seeds are usually drilled in well-prepared 
<br>seedbeds in rows 15 to 20 cm apart and covered with 
<br>0.6 cm of soil.  In nurseries with severe climates, 
<br>such as those in the Great Plains, considerable care 
<br>must be taken to protect the beds with mulch and 
<br>snow fences. 
<br> 
<br>Viability of the seed varies considerably from year to 
<br>year and among lots, but it is never much over 50 
<br>percent.  Treated seed is usually planted in the spring, 
<br>either in outdoor beds or in flats in the greenhouse. 
<br>Two or three years are required to produce plants 
<br>large enough to graft.
