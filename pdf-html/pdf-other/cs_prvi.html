<br>plantings for erosion control.  Chokecherry does well 
<br>in riparian area planting.  It provides thermal cover 
<br>over the water and works well in stabilizing 
<br>streambanks.  It has been used on disturbed sites such 
<br>as mined land reclamation, highway right-of-ways 
<br>and construction sites.  It is a good erosion control 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">plant because it can form thickets and spread by 
<br>rhizomes. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Wildlife:</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">  Chokecherry is important to many wildlife 
<br>animals.  Birds, rabbits, hares, rodents and bears all 
<br>seek out and eat its fruit.  It provides food, cover and 
<br>nesting habitat for a variety of birds. Birds will also 
<br>take advantage of its growth form for cover and 
<br>nesting habitat.  It is used extensively by deer as a 
<br>browse source in the winter.  The early spring 
<br>flowers provide an important source of nectar for 
<br>butterflies, honeybees and ants.   
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Food</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">:  The common name, chokecherry, came from 
<br>the bitter and astringent taste of the fruit. The fruit 
<br>was a staple for numerous Indian tribes across the 
<br>North American continent, especially to tribes who 
<br>lived on the plains and prairies.  Chokecherries were 
<br>routinely cooked before they were eaten or dried 
<br>thoroughly.  Both methods served to break down any 
<br>formation of prussic acid contained in the stone pits.  
<br>Drying chokecherries improves their taste by 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">sweetening them, or at the very least, getting rid of 
<br>the naturally occurring bitter taste.  Chokecherries 
<br>were consumed in three ways by Indians.  The fruit 
<br>and/or juice were eaten.   Whole cherries, including 
<br>pulp, skin and stone, were pulverized into a pulp, 
<br>shaped into balls and dried in the sun.  Fruit balls 
<br>could be stored for future use.  Either boiling or 
<br>drying the fruit will neutralize the naturally occurring 
<br>hydrocyanic acid.  The most important use was as 
<br>part of the recipe for pemmican, or mince-meat.  
<br>Pemmican was made by getting a slice of dried meat 
<br>(bison was preferred over elk, deer or antelope) and 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">pounding it with a stone until it had a fine texture.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Bone marrow and animal lard were then heated and 
<br>mixed with the meat.  Crushed chokecherries were

<br>very important commercial fruit trees (apple, peach, 
<br>plum, apricot, nectarines, and almonds) are in the 
<br>rose family.  Anthropologists indicate cherries have 
<br>been harvested in Eurasia from 4,000 to 5,000 B.C.  
<br>In 1629, chokecherry was imported to England where 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">it has been cultivated as an ornamental.  It was first 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">cultivated in North America as an orchard crop in 
<br>1724.

<br>food.  Some form of pemmican was a mainstay for all 
<br>plains tribes.  Chokecherry butter was made by 
<br>cooking the mature fruit, straining out the seed and 
<br>skins, mixing this poultice with an equal quantity of 
<br>wild plums or crabapples and adding sugar.  The bark 
<br>was brewed for a tea drink.  Many tribes would add 
<br>the fruits to soups and stews as flavoring and as a</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:15px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">thickening agent.  A green branch was speared 
<br>through a meat slab while it was cooking to add spice 
<br>to the taste. 
<br> 
<br>Likewise, pioneers and settlers came to realize its 
<br>food value.  Mature fruits are still collected today and 
<br>used to make jellies, jams, pie-fillings, syrups, sauces 
<br>and wines. 
<br> 
<br>Like many plants and animals which were vital to 
<br>their survival some tribes used parts of the 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">chokecherry plant in their rituals.  A green dye was 
<br>derived from the leaves, inner bark and immature 
<br>fruit.  A purplish-red dye was derived from the ripe 
<br>fruit. The Cheyenne used the limbs to make arrow 
<br>shafts and bows.  The Crows used it for tipi stakes 
<br>and pins.  Mountain men washed their steel traps in 
<br>water boiled with the bark to remove the scent.  It is 
<br>speculated many tribes planted seeds in places they 
<br>frequented to ensure a supply of chokecherries was 
<br>always available. 
<br> 
<br>Chokecherry is being promoted for planting as a 
<br>minor crop in the prairie provinces of Canada for 
<br>juice production.  Estimated fruit production potential 
<br>is 15,000 pounds per acre from mature plants.  There 
<br>is a significant research effort in Canada for 
<br>developing fruit producing cultivars. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Landscaping:</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">  In some parts of the U.S., chokecherry 
<br>is a popular ornamental.  Its quick growth, mature 
<br>size, attractive white flowers in the spring and strong, 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">sweet and almond-like aroma fragrance make it a 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">good yard tree in urban neighborhoods.  Cultivars are 
<br>planted for ornamentals rather than the native 
<br>species.  All native chokecherry varieties have a great 
<br>tendency to sucker, which can create problems in 
<br>lawn care.  Most cultivated varieties do not have this 
<br>suckering trait while producing more attractive 
<br>flowers and/or larger fruit.  The fruit also attracts a 
<br>diverse population of birds for a number of weeks.  
<br>Chokecherries can be a component in a screen or 
<br>noise barrier planting.

<br>The Arika women would drink the berry juice to stop

<br> 
<br>The Blackfeet drank berry juice for diarrhea and sore

<br>with Saskatoon serviceberry (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Amelanchier almifolia</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">) 
<br>was taken as a general purge treatment and to 
<br>lactating mothers so they could pass on the medicinal

<br>Warm chokecherry tea was given to women when 
<br>labor pains began.  The root bark is a good astringent 
<br>and was mixed with water and used as a rinse for 
<br>open sores and old skin ulcers.  The tree bark of 
<br>spicebush (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Lindera benzoin</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">) and flowering dogwood 
<br>(</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Cornus florida</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">) was added to corn whiskey and used 
<br>to treat for measles.  The fruit was boiled and eaten to 
<br>treat for bloody bowels.  The branches and leaves 
<br>were one of six ingredients burned in sweat lodges to 
<br>treat for indigestion and jaundice. 
<br>The Cheyenne would gather the immature fruit, dry it 
<br>in the sun, pulverize it and use it as a treatment for 
<br>diarrhea.  
<br> 
<br>The Paiutes made a medicinal tea from the leaves and 
<br>twigs to treat colds and rheumatism. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">The Sioux chewed the dried roots and then placed 
<br>this poultice in open wounds to stop the bleeding.  
<br>The Sioux, Crows, Gros Ventres and others made a 
<br>bark tea to cure stomach aches, diarrhea and

<br>recommended as a rinse on burns, open sores, 
<br>cankers and skin ulcers.  Pharmaceutical books at that 
<br>time cautioned against boiling any mixture using 
<br>chokecherry leaves or bark because it would drive off 
<br>the medicinal properties.  The bark was used as a 
<br>flavoring agent in many cough syrups.  In 1834, Dr. 
<br>Proctor first identified the bark as containing prussic 
<br>acid.   
<br> 
<br>In their journals, Lewis and Clark recorded that while 
<br>camped on the upper Missouri River Captain Lewis

<br>native, perennial, deciduous, woody, thicket-forming 
<br>large erect shrub or small tree. It rarely reaches a 
<br>height of over 30 feet.  The crown is irregular and 
<br>from 10 to 20 feet wide when mature.  The stems are 
<br>numerous and slender.  Reproduction can either be by 
<br>seed or root rhizomes. 
<br> 
<br>Leaves are dark green and glossy above and paler 
<br>beneath.  They are alternate, simple, glabrous, oval to 
<br>broadly elliptic in shape, 1 to 4 inches long, and 3/4 
<br>to 2 inches wide.  The margins are toothed with 
<br>closely-spaced sharp teeth pointing outward forming 
<br>a serrated edge.  They turn yellow in autumn. 
<br> 
<br>The bark of young trees may vary from gray to a 
<br>reddish brown.  As it ages the bark turns darker, into 
<br>brownish-black and becomes noticeably furrowed.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">The bark is distinctly marked by horizontal rows of 
<br>raised air pores (lenticels).  With maturation the 
<br>lenticels develop into shallow grooves.  
<br> 
<br>It has perfect flowers which are aromatic and 
<br>arranged in cylindrical racemes 3 to 6 inches long.  
<br>The racemes always grow on the current year's leafy 
<br>twig growth.  Individual flowers are perfect, 1/4 to 
<br>3/8 inch in diameter with 5 white petals.  The flowers 
<br>start appearing before the leaves are fully developed.  
<br>Flowers may appear from April to July and fruits 
<br>form a couple of months later.    
<br> 
<br>The fruits are spherical drupes (fleshy fruit with a 
<br>stone in the center), globose, 1/4 to 3/8 inch in 
<br>diameter.  Small ripe cherries range in color from 
<br>dark red or purple to almost black.  There are from 
<br>3,000 to 5,000 seeds per pound.  
<br> 
<br>The roots are a network of rhizomes.  Deep root 
<br>systems grow at irregular intervals along the length 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">of the rhizomes.  Rhizomes can extend beyond the 
<br>drip zone, up to 35 feet away from the base of the 
<br>tree.  Rhizomes grow up to 3/4 inch in diameter. 
<br> 
<br>There are three recognized varieties of </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Prunus 
<br>virginiana</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">.  The variety </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">demissa</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> is commonly called 
<br>western chokecherry.  It produces dark red fruit.  The 
<br>variety </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">melanocarpa</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> produces black fruit.  The 
<br>variety </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">virginiana</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> produces crimson to deep red fruit. 
<br>This variety can be found in two forms, one with red 
<br>and one with white fruit. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Habitat</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">: Chokecherry is found in a large geographic 
<br>area and it grows abundantly in many habitat types 
<br>and plant associations.  It may be found in thin 
<br>stands, as dense thickets or individually in open

<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br>Chokecherry occurs naturally in a wide range of soil 
<br>types and textures.  Soils supporting chokecherry 
<br>vary considerably, from abandoned construction 
<br>sites, with almost no soil depth or fertility, to deep 
<br>virgin grasslands, with deep profiles and a high level 
<br>of nutrients.  Soil textures range from silt to sandy 
<br>loam, it does not do well on heavy clay soils.  Soil 
<br>pH can vary from 5.2 (mildly acid) to 8.4 
<br>(moderately alkaline) without any adverse effect 
<br>upon growth.  Precipitation ranges from 13 to 65 
<br>inches annually.  Sites range from low to mostly mid-
<br>elevation, although it also occurs from 8,000 to 
<br>10,000 feet in Idaho, Nevada and Utah.  It is widely 
<br>adaptable to temperature extremes.  It is found in 
<br>USDA hardiness zones 2 to 7 naturally.  If planted, 
<br>chokecherry will grow into zone 10.  The four major 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">limiting factors in its habitat are that it is intolerant of 
<br>shade, poor drainage, frequent flooding and soils with 
<br>a large amount of clay.   
<br> 
<br>Many wildlife animals eat the fruit and distribute it.  
<br>Birds are by far the most common carrier of the 
<br>seeds.  As a consequence it grows abundantly on 
<br>places where birds rest, like along roadsides, fences, 
<br>hedgerows, riparian margins and forest clearings. 
<br>Chokecherry is well adapted to fire disturbance.  It 
<br>can be top-killed by fire, but re-sprouts readily from 
<br>root crowns and rhizomes.  Seed germination is 
<br>apparently improved with heat treatment, suggesting 
<br>a further adaptation to fire. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br>Known Distribution 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Distribution</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">: Chokecherry is found in all but eight 
<br>states or territories.  For current distribution, please 
<br>consult the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
<br>PLANTS Web site. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br>Establishment 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Nursery grown seedlings establish satisfactorily if 
<br>planted free of competition in areas having 15 or 
<br>more inches of annual precipitation.  If seeds are 
<br>planted in the spring they should be pre-chilled for 3 
<br>months, then placed about 1/2 inch deep.  Saplings 
<br>are not tolerant of weedy competition for 2 to 3 years 
<br>after planting.  Use of weed barrier mat, a strict 
<br>cultivation regime, or proper herbicide treatment is 
<br>necessary if a successful planting is to occur.  Check 
<br>with your local NRCS Field Office to determine if 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">chokecherry is adapted to your area or soils before 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">planting any trees.

<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Management of chokecherry will be dependent on 
<br>whether it is looked upon as a desirable or 
<br>undesirable plant.  On range and pastures it is often 
<br>considered a potential hazard to livestock.  As a 
<br>consequence either mechanical and/or herbicide 
<br>treatments combined with good grassland 
<br>management is needed to prevent animal loss.  When 
<br>it is used in windbreaks, as an ornamental plant or as 
<br>a wildlife resource it is beneficial.  Control of weedy 
<br>vegetation, and treatment for potential diseases, is 
<br>necessary if it is expected to grow for an extended 
<br>period of years 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Pests and Potential Problems 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Chokecherry is susceptible to X-disease, black knot, 
<br>stem decay, shothole, Valsa canker, and honey 
<br>fungus </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Plowrightia stansburiana</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">.   Common insects 
<br>pests are the prairie tent caterpillar, eastern tent 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">caterpillar and aphids.  In the northeastern United 
<br>States, chokecherry is a primary host of the eastern 
<br>tent caterpillar.  Browsing by deer on young 
<br>immature trees causes considerable damage in some 
<br>areas.</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Environmental Concerns 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">The leaves, bark, stem, and stone (seed pit) of 
<br>chokecherry are all toxic.  It is potentially poisonous 
<br>to all classes of livestock, but cattle and sheep are the 
<br>ones commonly affected.  The meaty flesh of the fruit 
<br>is not toxic. 
<br> 
<br>Hydrocyanic acid (HCN) is often called Prussic acid.  
<br>HCN does not occur freely as a plant compound.  It is 
<br>formed only after disruption of the plant cell, either 
<br>by mechanical injury or a sudden freeze.  Only then 
<br>do the degradative enzymes (hydroxynitrile lyases) 
<br>and glycoside come into contact and mix together.  
<br>HCN acid occurs in greatest amounts in the leaves.  
<br>Generally, the amount of HCN in the leaves lessens 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">as the growing season progresses.  By autumn 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">chokecherry leaves have so little glycoside, a 
<br>component of HCN, they are not normally considered 
<br>hazardous.  Drought stress may cause the leaves to 
<br>concentrate the glycoside in heavier amounts than 
<br>usual.  Wilted leaves are more toxic per unit weight 
<br>due to dehydration, which concentrates the 
<br>components, which make up HCN.  HCN is so toxic 
<br>at low levels because it inhibits blood cells from 
<br>absorbing oxygen.  One symptom of HCN poisoning 
<br>is the blood turns bright red when exposed to the air 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">and it clots abnormally slow.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br>Cyanogenic glycosides (prunasin, produced in the 
<br>leaves and twigs, and amygdalin, produced in the 
<br>stone) are the building blocks for HCN.  Of the two, 
<br></span></div><span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:529px; top:2850px; width:3px; height:0px;"></span>

<div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:71px; top:3488px; width:217px; height:645px;"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">prunasin is found in a much larger quantity. HCN is 
<br>most commonly formed in the plant due to 
<br>mechanical injury (such as browsing), a sudden 
<br>change in temperature (an early and heavy frost) or in 
<br>the animal during digestion.  The glycosides can 
<br>either be hydrolyzed by enzymes in the plants or by 
<br>rumen microorganisms. The glycosides occur in 
<br>vacuoles in plant tissue while the enzymes are found 
<br>in the cytosol. 
<br> 
<br>Ingestion of about 0.25 percent of an animal's body 
<br>weight, or 50 milligrams/kilogram of body weight, is 
<br>the Lethal Dose of fifty percent of animals (LD50).  
<br>This means less than 4 ounces of fresh leaves can be 
<br>toxic to a 100 pound animal. 
<br> 
<br>Poisoning generally occurs when animals graze this 
<br>amount or more in an hour or less.  Formation of 
<br>HCN must occur primarily within the short time 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">between the mastication of the forage and its arrival 
<br>in the stomach, for the acidic contents of the stomach 
<br>slows down the reaction of the chemical process 
<br>which creates the HCN.  The toxic elements become 
<br>even more active if the animal drinks water 
<br>immediately after browsing.  HCN works so quickly 
<br>by the time poisoning symptoms are identified it is 
<br>generally too late to treat.  Injection of a combination 
<br>of sodium thiosulfate and sodium nitrite in the veins 
<br>or peritoneum is the recommended antidote.  
<br>Oxidizing substances such as potassium 
<br>permanganate or hydrogen peroxide given as a 
<br>drench may help some.  Any other medications 
<br>promoting respiratory help and nerve stimulants may 
<br>also contribute to recovery.  For any treatment to be 
<br>effective it must be given immediately upon 
<br>symptoms of poisoning.</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:15px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br>Removing livestock from the HCN source is the only 
<br>practical way to prevent mass poisoning and 
<br>numerous losses once it has been detected. Good 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">livestock management includes keeping hungry 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">livestock away from areas where chokecherry is 
<br>abundant.  Maintaining a good level of preferred 
<br>forage in pastures will do a great deal in preventing 
<br>HCN poisoning.  
<br> 
<br>When a person eats a single apple seed or cherry pit, 
<br>though not recommended, it is unlikely to cause 
<br>discomfort or serious illness.  However, there have 
<br>been reported deaths, usually of children chewing on 
<br>the stems and leaves, or swallowing the stones. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Visible reactions to poisoning may include; anxiety; 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">uneasiness; confusion; dizziness; vertigo;  headache; 
<br>nausea; vomiting; the lips turn blue; bloating;

<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Seeds and Plant Production 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Chokecherry can be propagated by seed, rhizome 
<br>cuttings, suckers, crown division, semi-hardwood 
<br>cuttings and grafting.  Generally, seed</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:15px"> </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">crops are 
<br>regular and viable.  The flowers are more abundant 
<br>and more fruit is produced on plants growing on open 
<br>sites or in forest clearings.  Natural dispersal of the 
<br>seed occurs when it passes through the digestive 
<br>tracts of mammals and birds.  The seeds may be 
<br>carried a long distance from the parent plant in this 
<br>manner.  If the rhizomatous roots are damaged due to 
<br>a mechanical injury suckers will be produced.  This is 
<br>often how thickets are formed.  A fire initially causes 
<br>major damage to a stand of chokecherry.  However, 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">regrowth is enhanced for several years following a 
<br>burn.  It sprouts vigorously from surviving root 
<br>crowns and suckers arise from the rhizomes. 
<br>Chokecherry has seed dormancy. About half of the 
<br>seed which is not stratified germinates within a 
<br>couple of months.  Delayed germination may occur 
<br>up to 4 months. An after-ripening period in the 
<br>presence of oxygen and moisture is needed for a 
<br>majority of seed to germinate.  Good</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:15px"> </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">germination can 
<br>only be expected after a cool, moist stratification 
<br>regime lasting 90 to 160 days at 36 to 41 degrees 
<br>Fahrenheit.  Sow 25 seeds per foot of drill row. One- 
<br>year-old bareroot stock should be planted on deep, 
<br>well-drained soils in sunny locations. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and 
<br>area of origin) 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Planting materials can be obtained from most 
<br>commercial hardwood nurseries and seed sources.  
<br>Several cultivars have been released by government 
<br>agencies and private nurseries for use in landscaping 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">and/or fruit production.  The two most commonly 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">marketed cultivars are 'Schubert', and 'Canada Red'.  
<br>A lot of literature states that these two cultivars are 
<br>the same one with just different names.  This is not 
<br>the entire truth.  'Schubert' is one of the oldest 
<br>cultivars.  Its parent rootstock is </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Prunus virginiana 
<br>melanocarpa</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> selected from a native stand near Valley 
<br>City, North Dakota.  It was released by the Oscar 
<br>Will Nursery which was located in Bismarck.  
<br>'Canada Red' was created by grafting 'Schubert' on 
<br>Mayday rootstock to get rid of the suckering trait.   
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Releases from Canada include, 'Garrington', 'Goertz' 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">and 'Robert'.
