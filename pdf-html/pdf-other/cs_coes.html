<br>Ethnobotanical</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">:</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> Taro was the most important food 
<br>throughout the Hawaiian Islands.  The mature root is 
<br>boiled as a starchy vegetable.  It was the staple of the 
<br>Hawaiian diet and the plant used to make poi.   
<br> 
<br>The leaves are high in minerals and vitamins A, B, 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">and C.  These large leaves are cooked like mustard or 
<br>turnip greens and the resulting product is called 
<br>callaloo in the Caribbean. 
<br> 
<br>The young leaves are cooked and used for human 
<br>consumption as a very nutritious vegetable and the 
<br>corms are used as staple in place of rice or potato 
<br>(Plucknett and White 1979).  These young leaves are 
<br>boiled or covered with coconut cream, wrapped in 
<br>banana or breadfruit leaves and cooked on hot stones 
<br>(Kubo 1970).   
<br> 
<br>The corms are generally cooked by baking, boiling or 
<br>baking in the traditional ovens. 
<br> 
<br>The starch contained in the large corms of taro is 
<br>highly digestible, therefore making it a good source 
<br>for carbohydrate and to a lesser degree a source of 
<br>potassium and protein.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Taro corms have been used in the production of taro 
<br>chips, dehydrated stable commodities, starch, flour, 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">and in non-food application of taro starch in the 
<br>manufacture of biodegradable plastics.  
<br> 
<br>Taro is good for people allergic to milk or cereals and 
<br>can be consumed by children who are sensitive to 
<br>milk (Roth and et.al., 1967). 
<br> 
<br>The digestibility of taro starch has been estimated to 
<br>be 98.8 percent.  Therefore taro flour and other 
<br>products have been used for infant formulae in the 
<br>United States and have formed an important 
<br>constituent of proprietary canned baby foods.

<br>sit on taro leaves.  Juice of the petioles is styptic and 
<br>was used to arrest arterial hemorrhage.  Taro was 
<br>used in earache and as an external stimulant and 
<br>rubefacient.  Taro was used as a laxative in cases of 
<br>hemorrhoids.  Some tribes use taro as an antidote to 
<br>the stings of wasps and other biting or stinging 
<br>insects.  Heated tubers were applied to painful parts 
<br>in rheumatism.  Honey mixed with tuber ash was 
<br>used as a cure for apthae in the mouth.

<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">believed to have originated in South East Asia 
<br>including India and Malaysia.  Spencer (1966) stated 
<br>that taro and other edible arioida were distributed

<br> 
<br>Taro, sometimes called the &quot;potato of the tropics,&quot; or 
<br>&quot;elephant ears&quot; is a wetland herbaceous perennial 
<br>with huge “elephant ear” like leaves.  It produces 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">heart shaped leaves 2-3' long and 1-2' across on 3' 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">long petioles that all emanate from an upright

<br>spindly roots, and usually weighs around 1-2 pounds, 
<br>but can weigh eight pounds.  The skin is brown with 
<br>white or pink flesh.  Taros can produce smaller tubers 
<br>or &quot;cormels&quot; which grow off the sides of the main 
<br>corm.  Under ideal growing conditions, a single taro 
<br>plant can get 8' tall with an 8’canopy spread. 
<br> 
<br>There are more than 200 cultivars of taro, selected for 
<br>their edible corms or cormels, or their tropical 
<br>looking ornamental foliage.  These cultivars fall into 
<br>two main groups: wetland taros, the source of the 
<br>Polynesian food </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">poi</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">, which is made from the main 
<br>corm; and upland taros, which produce numerous 
<br>eddos that are used much like potatoes for cooking 
<br>and in processing.

<br>Taro, although grown commercially in many areas of</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">the Pacific Basin, for the most part, is a backyard 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">crop planted usually in small plots near the house.  
<br>Because taro has a high water requirement and a long 
<br>growing season it can only grow where water is 
<br>available most of</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px"> </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">the year.  Its ability to grow in 
<br>waterlogged conditions allows for the utilization of 
<br>hydromorphic soils which are unsuitable for other 
<br>crops (Onwueme, I.C. 1985)  
<br> 
<br>Taro and other aroid food crops have traditionally 
<br>been a source of food energy for Pacific Islanders.  
<br>Taro is a plant that must be tilled and watered if it is 
<br>to grow and perform.  The roots and suckers of many 
<br>varieties of taro were carried along the trade routes of 
<br>the world.  The taro plant has a triple value in that the 
<br>stem may be used as salads, the tubers provide easily 
<br>digested starch, with the leaves are used as a green 
<br>vegetable.  The leaves are also used as wrapping for 
<br>food, as plates, and as an umbrella in a rainstorm.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Cyrtosperma</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> (giant taro) provides for a reserve food

<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Adaptation; </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Taro can grow in a wide range of soil 
<br>from upland or dry land soils that are well drained, 
<br>non-flooded soils to soils that are in high rainfall 
<br>areas or saturated for prolonged periods of time.  
<br>Taro can grow in areas that only it and rice can grow 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">because of standing water during the growing season.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">The upland taro is usually grown on hillsides in soil 
<br>that is marginal in fertility and productivity.  Soils in 
<br>these areas are usually well drained and friable.

<br>water.  The soils in these areas are normally alluvial 
<br>and of high native fertility and production. </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br>Taro can grow in areas ranging from sea level to 
<br>1,800 m in elevation under daily average temperature 
<br>of 21-27°C and rainfall of 250 cm annually.  Taro is 
<br>usually planted at wide spacing of 1m x 1m at a 
<br>density of 10,000 plants/ha in dry areas and at 
<br>spacing as close as 45cm x 45cm or approximately 
<br>49,000 plants/ha in wetland areas.  
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Planting material  
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Taro is usually the first crop planted after the 
<br>clearance of a forest fallow because the soil if very 
<br>fertile.  However after repeated use the soil becomes 
<br>less productive and will require organic or inorganic 
<br>fertilizer to maintain high yields.  If commercial 
<br>fertilizer is used be sure not to place the fertilizer in 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">the bottom of the hole with the sucker because the 
<br>fertilizer will destroy the young sucker.  
<br> 
<br>In the South Pacific, “tiapuli” or setts are prepared 
<br>from the suckers or main plant.  The tiapuli consist of 
<br>the cormels with the petioles and are the main 
<br>material used of propagating taro.  Small tiapuli used 
<br>for planting can have a considerable effect on yield if 
<br>weeding is delayed during early establishment.  
<br>Large size planting material grows more vigorously, 
<br>giving full ground cover earlier and hence providing 
<br>better weed control.  Planting depth should be in a 
<br>furrow or hole about 30 cm deep.  Planting should be 
<br>timed to rainfall with lower rainfall areas planted 
<br>during the early part of the rainy season for best 
<br>survival and production.  In areas with well-
<br>distributed rainfall or if one is using irrigation the 
<br>effect of planting dates is less important because 
<br>planting can occur throughout the year.  Most of the 
<br>planting and production operation is manual in small 
<br>communities except for occasional chemical weed 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">control.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br>In Hawaii, the planting material is called huli.  Huli 
<br>are the cormels ('oha or keiki) that have been 
<br>trimmed. When the kalo plant is harvested, the keiki 
<br>are cut off from the harvested makua plant and their 
<br>leaves and corms are cut off, leaving only about a 
<br>quarter of an inch attached to the stem. These huli are 
<br>then left in a cool, dry place for a day or two to allow 
<br>the cut to heal before they are planted again. The huli 
<br>should be kept moist so that they don’t dry out but 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">should not be left in standing water otherwise they 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">will rot. After a day or so, the huli will be ready for 
<br>planting. 
<br>Wet kalo is grown in the lowlands and on valley 
<br>floors in man made terraces (Lo'i) that are irrigated 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:306px; top:1767px; width:3px; height:15px;"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:15px">

<br>planted in rows or in mounds in the lo'i. They will 
<br>grow to maturity in 9-14 months, depending on the 
<br>variety. Wet kalo must have cold water running 
<br>through it’s lo'i because warm, standing water will 
<br>cause the kalo to rot.  
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Management</span><span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Weeding must be preformed during the first six 
<br>months after planting.  If weeding is not done on a 
<br>regular basis during the first six months, taro 
<br>production can be reduced by as much as 50 to 85 
<br>percent.  Weeding after six months is usually not 
<br>important because the taro crop forms full ground 
<br>cover therefore preventing young weeds from 
<br>growing.  Unwanted vegetation can be controlled 
<br>using mechanical means or through the use of 
<br>approved herbicides.  
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">The taro must be weeded and mulched several times 
<br>during the crop’s growth. Commercial fertilizers are 
<br>also used to produce larger plants. 
<br> 
<br>When the crop is ready to be harvested, the taro are 
<br>pulled out of the ground and the corms cut off. The 
<br>new planting material will also be prepared at this 
<br>time. If the taro is being grown for the leaves, the 
<br>leaves should be picked about two months after 
<br>planting when the leaves are large but still young. If 
<br>the taro is being grown for the corms, then they 
<br>should be harvested when the corms reach maturity. 
<br>Taro that is being grown for the corms should not be 
<br>used for leaves because picking the leaves while the 
<br>corm is developing will damage the corm. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Harvesting  
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Harvesting of taro depends on the location of the crop 
<br>and the variety planted.  However, most lowland 
<br>plantings can be harvested in 12 to 15 months after 
<br>planting if weeds are controlled.  Taro growing on 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">the warmer upland sites with good solar radiation 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">will mature in about 12 months.  Most of the taro 
<br>grown in the lowlands or wetland areas is harvested
