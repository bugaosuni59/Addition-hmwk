General: Barley is an annual, cool season bunchgrass that grows 2–4 ft tall (Ball et al., 1996). Stems are hollow and jointed. 
Leaf surfaces and leaf margins are smooth, tapered, and arise on the stem above ground level (Brown, 1979). Nodes and 
internodes of stems are hairless (Radford et al., 1968). Seeds are borne on a spike inflorescence ¾ to 4 inches (2–10 cm) long 
with flower clusters in groups of three long bristles (called awns). Awns can be absent in some varieties, but when present 
can reach 6 inches in length (Radford et al., 1968).  
Prior to flowering, barley can be confused with other small grains. Barley is distinguished from wheat, rye, and oats by 
examining the leaf collar when it is pulled away from the stem. The leaf collar on a barley plant will have two overlapping 
appendages that clasp the stem, called auricles (Ball et al., 1996) 
There are two different groups of barley, the six-rowed and two-rowed types. These groups refer to the differences in the 
arrangement of the seedheads in the spike. When viewing a head of six-rowed barley from above, there are six rows of 
kernels, three on each side of the rachis (seedhead stem). In two-rowed barley, only the middle spikelet develops a kernel, 
and the other two spikelets are sterile. When viewed from above, the two-rowed type appears to have only two kernels 
(Carena et al., 2009).  
 
Traditionally, barley has a husk or hull around the grain that limits digestibility. Hull-less 
varieties have hulls that can easily be removed from the grain when it is combined and 
threshed, and contain more digestible energy (Griffey et al., 2009).  
 
Distribution: Barley is not native to the United States and only exists in cultivated areas. It 
sometimes volunteers in fields and disturbed areas, but is not persistent (Hitchcock and 
Chase, 1971). It can be found in grainfields and along roads from Connecticut to New 
Jersey, South Dakota, Montana, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and California. For current 
distribution, please consult the Plant Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
site. 
 
Habitat: Barley is an ancient cereal crop that does not exist in the wild. It has been grown 
all around the world, and its precise origin is unknown (Harlan, 1979). Barley may have 
evolved from Hordeum spontaneum, a weedy plant commonly found throughout the fertile 
crescent region of the Near East. However, there is evidence to suggest that Hordeum 
agriocrithon, discovered in 1938 in Tibet, may be a closer ancestor to modern cultivated

Barley grows well with supplemental irrigation in cool, dry areas. It can be grown in a hot climate, but is more susceptible to 
diseases and pathogens in a hot, humid climate (Weibe, 1979). Barley crops are not typically grown in the humid regions of 
the southeastern United States (Schaffer, 1993). It is more winter-hardy than oats, but is more prone to winterkill than wheat 









Page 2
 
or rye (Weibe, 1979). Barley is sensitive to winter conditions and will die if the temperature drops below 17°F (Hannaway et 
al., 2004).  
 
Barley cannot tolerate poorly drained soil, grows well when pH values are between 6.0– 8.5 (Midwest Cover Crops Council, 
2012), and has been used to reclaim saline soils (Hannaway et al., 2004). It generally grows better than any other small grain 
in highly alkaline soils (Reid et al., 1979). Best soils for growing barley are well-drained loams and clay loams (Reid et al., 
1979). Growing barley on sandy soils causes uneven plant growth and development (Hannaway et al., 2004).  
' WHERE symbol='g_horde';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Uses TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Uses='Cereal grain production: Barley is a cool-season annual grass that produces grain for human and animal consumption. 
Because there are both summer and winter varieties, barley can be grown at a wide variety of locations. It ranks fourth in 
terms of world grain production behind maize (Zea maize L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and rice (Oryza sativa L.) 
(Carena, 2009). In the United States, barley grain is used primarily as a high-protein additive to livestock feed for cattle, 
sheep, pigs, and poultry. An estimated 25% of barley grain production in the United States is used to make malted beverages 
such as beer (Davidson et al., 2012). This crop is one of the only cereal crops that can withstand high elevations and short 
growing seasons, and is an important food staple for humans in the Andes mountains of Peru and the high plateaus of Tibet 
(Carena, 2009).  
 
Forage: Barley, like other small grain crops, can be grazed by livestock before seedheads are produced. Barley can be 
planted sooner than wheat, and provides early season grazing. It is a valuable annual forage during drought, as it uses water 
more efficiently than other small grains (Schaffer, 1993). Silage yields are generally 2.5 ton/acre of dry matter with 9% crude 
protein and 27% crude fiber (Ball et al., 1998).  
 
Cover crop: Barley is also used as a cover crop, a crop grown specifically to maintain cropland soil quality, fertility, and 
productivity (Magdoff and Van Es, 2009). Cover crops are not harvested and are terminated on the surface or incorporated 
into soil before they mature. Cover crop species limit soil erosion by providing cover to the soil when a commercial crop is 
not growing. 
 
In the United States, barley can be grown farther north than other cereal grains and can produce more biomass than other 
small grain crops in a shorter amount of time (Clark, 2010). Barley is often seeded in mixtures with legumes to boost soil 
nitrogen levels. It can be planted as a winter annual in warmer climates or as a spring annual in cooler climates, but is most 
popular in the Midwest Corn Belt, Northern Plains, Inland Northwest, Northwest Maritime, California Central Valley, and 
Southwest bioregions (Clark, 2010). Seed is usually inexpensive and easy to acquire. Barley as a cover crop provides 
solutions to the specific resource concerns listed below.  
 
Weed control: Barley is a fast-growing annual grass that competes with weeds by shading and absorbing nutrients and water 
from the soil. Barley also discourages weed germination by producing allelopathic chemicals (chemicals that are toxic to 
other plants). An Ohio study found that using barley as a cover crop suppressed yellow foxtail (Setaria glauca) emergence by 
81% (Creamer et al., 1996a).  
 
Soil condition, erosion: Barley cover crops protect soil from erosion, especially when grown as a winter annual in Plant 
Hardiness Zone 8 and warmer (California, western Oregon, and Washington) (Clark, 2010). Roots develop in the fall and can 
reach a vertical depth of 6.5 feet. Barley is planted between rows of berries in Oregon and between the rows of vineyards in 
California to hold the soil.  
 
Excessive nitrate leaching: Grass cover crops have deep roots and are useful for their ability to capture nitrogen by the 
primary crop. Barley absorbs nitrogen and retains it in long-lasting biomass. 
 
Inadequate soil organic matter/soil quality: Barley crops can produce up to 12,900 lb/acre of biomass (Clark, 2010). Leaving 
this biomass on the field to decompose increases the amount of organic matter in the soil. Increasing soil organic matter can 
increase soil aggregate stability, adequate soil drainage, and adequate soil pore space for oxygen, water, and plant roots.  
 
Pest Management: Growing barley as a cover crop in a soybean rotation may improve beneficial fungi associations in 
soybean roots. One study reported that these fungal benefits increased soybean yields when compared to an area grown 
without a cover crop (Shimazaki et al., 2008). Planting a barley crop prior to growing potatoes as part of a rotational crop 
system has also been recommended to reduce soil pathogens that cause rhizoctonia canker, black scurf, and common scab 
(Larkin, 2010).

Nurse/companion crop: Barley is commonly planted to protect vegetable crops such as carrots and onions that are vulnerable 
to wind damage. It maintains an upright habit after termination with a herbicide, which protects vegetables more effectively 
than oat nurse crops (Midwest Cover Crops Council, 2012). When seeded in a fall mixture, barley can provide protection to 
fragile red clover or sweet clover seedlings (Reid et al., 1979). It can serve as a companion crop for alfalfa plantings in the 
irrigated western states because it does not persist or compete with the alfalfa after the first growing season (Reid et al., 
1979).  
Air quality: Cotton producers in Arizona have planted barley as a winter cover crop to control blowing dust within PM-10 
(particulate matter that is 10 micrometers or less) active management areas (Munda et al., 1998). Cotton fields on highly 
erodible land (HEL) are usually fallow when wind velocities are highest and precipitation is lowest. Barley cover crops can 
be seeded after cotton crop harvest to hold the soil and limit wind erosion. Munda et al. (1998) reported that a barley crop in 
southern Arizona achieved 90% groundcover on a silty clay textured soil and 65% groundcover on a sandy textured soil with 
minimal irrigation.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Ethnobotany='Barley has been grown since ancient times to provide dietary starch to human societies. It remains a dietary staple for 
societies where wheat or corn will not grow, such as the Himalayas and Tibet. Barley grown in these regions is usually the 
naked (hull-less) variety because it is easier to grind into flour for breads or porridge (Reid et al., 1979).  
 
Barley was brought to America by two routes. Columbus carried seed on his ships from Haiti to New England and Spanish 
conquerors brought barley to the southwestern region in the 17th century (Wiebe, 1979). Colonists planted barley mainly for 
conversion to malted beverages. Barley is better suited than wheat and rye to malting procedures because the seed has an 
intact hull that protects the seed while it is germinating and being processed (Dickson, 1979). The seed kernel is also firmer 
than other cereals, and can be handled with less damage at high moisture contents typical in the malting process. Malting is 
the second largest use of barley, surpassed only by feed for livestock. Barley cultivars are designated as being either malting 
or feed qualities. Feed quality cultivars do not meet rigorous industry standards for malting.

recommended amounts at time of planting (Reid et al., 1979). If barley is planted in an arid climate, a minimum of one 
irrigation event is needed for establishment (Munda et al., 1998).  
 
Seeding dates: Barley can be grown at a wide variety of locations with very different planting dates. Regional seeding dates 
are summarized by Reid et al. (1979).  
Southeastern states: Winter barley is seeded from September to November. It can be seeded along with annual ryegrass 
(Lolium spp.) to provide quality cool-season hay, silage, or grazing pasture. Winter barley for pasture can be planted as early 
as August 15. 
Great Plains region: Spring barley can be planted March through May 1 in order to establish plants before warm summer 
temperatures. Winter varieties can also be planted in late January to February in the southern Great Plains. 
Northeastern states/New England: Spring barley can be planted March to June. 
Great Basin &amp. Pacific Northwest: Spring barley is planted from March 15–April 30, and winter barley is planted from 
September 1–October 15. Spring barley can be sown in the fall, but avoid planting varieties that flower early. These varieties 
may be harmed by late spring frosts.

nitrogen deficiencies. Since barley crops produce large amounts of biomass, planting the primary crop can be difficult with 
traditional planting equipment. It is important to terminate growth at the appropriate stage to minimize thatched residue, 
which can prevent primary crop germination by shading out seedlings. See Control/Cover Crop Termination for more

and milky (milk or dough stage). 
 
An alternative way to kill the crop while leaving residue to decompose on the surface involves the use of a roller crimper. A 
roller crimper is a custom piece of equipment designed to kill residue without intense tillage or chemicals (Sayre, 2003). A 
roller crimper attaches to a tractor and crimps the plants with corrugated blades and lays them flat on the surface. No-till 
planters can seed the primary crop directly into the leftover residue. Barley residue on top of the soil provides a mulch that 
limits weed germination and soil erosion, while conserving soil moisture for the primary crop. Clark and Panciera (2002) 
found that terminating a rye (Secale cereale) cover crop using the roller crimper was as effective as an herbicide treatment 
and did not affect subsequent corn yields planted into residue.  
 
To minimize re-sprouting, barley cover crops should be terminated using the roller crimper when the cover crop has flowered 
but not set seed. At least 20% of the crop should be at the soft dough stage to achieve full termination with the roller crimper

barley seed. Barley is generally planted in North Dakota as a spring crop in April.  
For grain crop establishment, plant higher rates of 120 lb/acre (Ottman, 2004). Seed size varies between cultivar and region 
of production, so it is important to determine seeds per pound before calculating seeding rate. Consult local cooperative 
extension recommendations for commercial barley crop seeding rates. In arid areas, adequate irrigation should be applied for 
establishment. General recommendations include application of 25–40 lb/acre of nitrogen at planting (Alley et al., 2009). It is 
important to calculate fertilizer rates based on soil tests because barley may exhibit lodging (collapse of tillers) when excess 
nitrogen is available. Alley et al. (2009) reported that lodging occurred in barley crops grown in Virginia fields when 
nitrogen application rates reached 100 lb/acre or greater. 
Barley harvest should occur when seed moisture content is between12.5 and 18% (McIntyre, 2010). If moisture content is 
below 11%, the seed is too dry and the seed coat may peel away (Davison, 2012). Harvesting crops with higher moisture 
content requires drying in cool, well-ventilated conditions. Seed is harvested mechanically with a combine and thresher. Seed 
harvested for use in the malting industry must be harvested with care, as cracked or skinned seeds are not acceptable to 
industry standards (McIntyre, 2010). Grains with 10.5% moisture or less can be stored for up to 18 months at 50–68°F, while 
grains with 12.5% moisture and above can only be stored for less than 3 months at 68–86°F to meet quality-malting standards

yarrow is a perennial herb that produces one to 
several stems (2-10 dm tall) from a fibrous 
underground horizontal rootstock (rhizome).  It is 
known to be both native and introduced.  Leaves are 
evenly distributed along the stem, with the leaves 
near the middle and bottom of the stem being the 
largest.  The leaves have varying degrees of hairiness 
(pubescence).  Leaf blades are lanceolate in outline, 
but bipinnately dissected.  Overall leaf dimensions 
range from 0.5-3 cm wide by 3-15 cm long.  The 
flower heads (inflorescence) have a flattened dome 
shape corymbiform (2.5-4 mm thick by 4-5 mm high) 
with approximately 10-20 ray flowers.  The flowers 
are whitish to yellowish-white.  The plant commonly 
persists from May through June.

Kawaiisu.  The Pomo cut bark from the base of the 
tree and made a poultice, which was laid on a 
snakebite.  Young buckeye shoots were sometimes 
used as spindles or twirling sticks in fire-making kits 
of the Sierra Miwok, Northern Maidu, Wappo, Yahi 
and other tribes. Many tribes mashed buckeye nuts 
and poured the contents into quiet pools to stupefy or 
kill fish. 
 
Wildlife: Do not plant buckeyes near apiaries as the 
flowers are poisonous to honey bees.  No wildlife eat 
buckeye seeds except squirrels, such as the California 
ground squirrel (Citellus beecheyi).

Serrano, Wappo, Sierra Miwok, Coast Miwok,

The Pomo ate the seeds even when other important 
food plants were plentiful.  The seeds are poisonous 
to humans in the raw state.  Thus, the nuts were 
cracked open with a rock, the shells removed, the 
seeds pounded into flour, and their toxic saponins 
removed in a lengthy leaching process.  The meal 
was subsequently cooked and eaten.  There are many 
different methods for processing and cooking 
buckeye seeds for food, depending upon the tribe.  
The seeds have medicinal properties and were cut 
into pieces, mixed with water, and made into 
suppositories for hemorrhoids by the Costanoan and

will sprout from this area so make sure that this spot 
is covered with soil. Plant the seeds in a well-drained 
soil.  Water the soil immediately after planting, and if 
there is not enough rain during the rainy season, 
supplement it with hand watering.  The plants will 
also need some summer watering the first year so a 
good rule to follow is to keep the soil damp.  The tree 
is a fast grower and can achieve as much as ten 
inches in height in one year.  After buckeye seeds 
have been in the ground one full year, they should 
become established, and will not need continual care.

late to harvest the leaves.  A generation or two ago, it 
was not uncommon for a Washoe family to harvest 
two or three sacks of onion leaves.  The odoriferous 
leaves are used similarly to chives bought from 
contemporary supermarkets.  They can be eaten raw 
as a snack, rolled into balls and sprinkled with salt, or 
used as a delicious herb to accompany acorn mush 
and various kinds of meat.  The leaves are eaten 
fresh, never cooked or stored for long periods.  The 
same areas are revisited year after year, having been 
harvested without depletion generation after 
generation.  Many lower elevation sites where the 
Washoe used to gather wild onions (probably 
different species) in the sagebrush scrub and under 
pinyon and cottonwood trees, are now marked with 
barbed wire fences and no trespassing signs. 
 
Wildlife: Elk, black bears (Ursus americanus), white-
tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys leucurus), and mantled 
ground squirrels (Citellus lateralis) eat the bulbs and 
greens of some kinds of wild onions.  Young 
vegetative growth of many wild onions are also 
highly palatable to cattle and sheep, but their feeding 
and trampling can conflict with indigenous 
harvesting.

an age-old tradition, the young leaves and stems that 
first appear after the snow melts (about April-May) 
have the best flavor and are harvested by the Washoe

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='At higher elevations, above the snowline, the black 
seeds should be planted in pots in early fall in the 
outdoors with no protection from the cold.  At lower 
elevations with warm winters, the seeds may need 
cold stratification (4-5 months) before planting to 
ensure good germination.  Seeds are planted in a 
well-drained soil, in a dense pattern, 4-5 seeds per 
square inch, and a thin layer of gravel should be 
placed on top to protect the plants from disturbance.  
Then wait for the natural rains.  If it is still a dry year, 
into November, supplement with hand watering.  
Start watering in spring, when the plants germinate.  
Make sure that the plants receive 2 inches of water 
(from either hand watering or rainfall) every week.  
With proper watering, these wild onions can grow in 
full sunlight, but they can also be planted in an area 
that receives afternoon shade.  Unlike mature bulbs 
they do not have reserves to draw upon for nutrients, 
so care should be taken to keep the soil damp, but not 
wet.  Do not let them dry out completely during the 
growing season.  Stop watering as soon as the foliage 
of the plants turns yellow.  Expect the plants to 
require three to five years to reach flowering size.  
When the seedlings are hardy enough, transplant into 
larger containers or plant into a bed prepared with 2 
parts (volume) loam, 1 part leaf mould. and 2 parts 
coarse sand/grit. 
 
The bulbs and bulblets of these wild onions can also 
be planted.  Bulblets can be brought to flowering size 
more quickly than by growing the plant by seed.  
After collecting the bulbs, store them in paper bags 
with dry peat moss.  They can be planted in late fall 
at the time of the first frost.  Plant them in plastic or 
wooden containers (clay dries out too quickly) in an 
acid, potting soil with a fair amount of sand and 
humus that gives excellent drainage.  Break off the 
daughter bulblets and plant them with the mature 
bulbs an inch apart and from six to eight inches deep.  
Do not water them at all.  Watch for them to 
germinate on their own, usually in early spring.  Start 
watering at least once a week.  If it is a dry spring, 
water twice a week.  Watering with a liquid fertilizer 
twice a month or applying a slow-release fertilizer in 
the spring may increase growth and vigor.  When the 
mature bulbs start to flower, stop watering.  These 
pots can sit outside in full sunlight until the daytime 
temperature gets above 75 degrees.  As it warms up, 
move the pots into the partial shade of vegetation or 
apply a 40-50% shade cloth.

has no commercial value.  Because root nodules of 
alders support nitrogen-fixing bacteria, yields of 
timber-producing trees can be enhanced when grown 
in association with alder, in the same way that 
leguminous crops increase production in agricultural 
crops.  The nitrogen-enhancing effect is local and 
restricted to trees in the immediate vicinity of the 
alder.  Rapid growth in open habitats, wide tolerance 
to soil types, and potential for soil conditioning make 
                          Plant Guide  
 
it useful in rehabilitation of disturbed sites, including 
old mines. 
 
Alders are beautiful and functional plants and deserve 
to be more widely grown in gardens and nurseries.  
They are fast growing and can easily be trained to a 
tree-like form by removing lower branches. 
 
Wildlife: Speckled alder thickets provide cover for 
moose, white-tailed deer, rabbits, and others.  Moose, 
muskrats, beavers, and rabbits browse the twigs and 
foliage.  Songbirds, including redpolls, goldfinches, 
woodcock, and grouse eat the seeds, buds, and 
catkins.  Beavers build dams and lodges with 
speckled alder. 
 
Ethnobotanic: Native Americans used speckled alder 
to treat anemia, as an emetic, a compress or wash for 
sore eyes, and a diaphoretic, for internal bleeding, 
urinary problems, sprains, bruises or backaches, 
itches, flux, and piles, to cure saddle gall in horses.  
When mixed with powdered bumblebees, it was used 
as an aid for difficult labor.  Tea was made from 
alder to cure diarrhea and toothaches.  Other bark 
mixtures were applied to rashes, eyes, and swelling.  
Chippewa Indians mixed alder root scraping with 
grounded up bumblebee and fed the mixture to 
women whom were having difficulty during 
childbirth. 
 
Erosion Control: Speckled alder’s acceptance of a 
wide variety of soil types makes it a good choice for 
disturbed site rehabilitation.  This is a valuable 
species to plant along stream banks for erosion 
control.

depressed veins, dull dark green above.  Male 
(pollen, staminate) and female (seed, pistillate) 
flowers are in catkins, borne separately, but on the 
same tree (the species monoecious).  The seed catkins 
are cone-like, cylindric to ovoid, 1-2 cm long, erect, 
sessile or on a short, stout stalk, generally remaining 
intact after release of fruits in spring.  The pollen 
catkins are elongate, 2-7 cm long, in hanging clusters 
from near the shoot tip.  The common name 
(speckled) is in reference to the numerous lenticels 
covering the bark.   
 
Variation within the species: Speckled alder is 
similar in growth form and habitat to mountain alder 
(Alnus tenuifolia), which ranges from Alaska, Yukon, 
and Mackenzie southward to New Mexico.  In 
mountain alder, the leaf blades are thin and papery, 
with rounded or blunt teeth, compared to the thick 
leaf blades with sharp teeth in speckled alder. 
mountain alder also is more treelike than speckled 
alder.  They intergrade where their distributions 
overlap in Saskatchewan westward.  Eurasian or 
European alder (Alnus incana) also is similar to these 
North American natives.  When these three are 
‘lumped’ (considered to represent only a single 
species, using the oldest name), the nomenclature is 
summarized as below.  Many still consider them to 
represent three separate species.

Brookside alder (Alnus serrulata), a species of the 
eastern and southeastern USA, has sometimes been 
included as a subspecies of A. incana but is now 
generally regarded as a separate species.  Hybrids 
occur where brookside alder and speckled alder grow 
together.

Speckled alder ranges over much of the eastern two-
thirds of Canada and reaches into Alberta, British 
Columbia, Mackenzie, and Yukon.  In the USA, it 
 
 
reaches into the Lake States and Northeast and as far 
south (at higher elevations) as Iowa, West Virginia, 
Maryland, and Virginia.  For current distribution, 
please consult the Plant Profile page for this species 
on the PLANTS Web site.  
 
' WHERE symbol='alinr';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Adaptation: Speckled alder colonizes stream banks, 
lake shores, and damp meadows and also occurs in 
bogs and nutrient-rich swamp communities, at 0-800 
meters.  It is weedy in damp areas along roadsides 
and other disturbed sites.  It grows abundantly in 
various soil types, from sandy to gravelly, loamy, 
clayey, and mucky, and it can tolerate periods of 
flooding as well as occasional droughts.  It often 
dominates the understory in communities of black 
spruce, balsam fir, jack pine, tamarack, northern 
white-cedar, balsam poplar, and birch-aspen, but 
growth and reproduction occur most vigorously in 
full sun.  Overstory removal brings rapid release of 
speckled alder, which may form dense, nearly pure 
thickets.  Gaps created by fire and logging in these 
wetland forests are quickly invaded by speckled 
alder.   
 
Flowering occurs in early spring (March–May), 
before the leaves appear, the inflorescences formed in 
late summer the season before flowering.  Fruit 
maturation is in late August–September with the 
seeds dispersed the following spring.  
 
Propagation by Seed: Speckled alder can be 
propagated by seed or by cuttings.  Seeds are shaken 
from dried cones collected in September and October 
and can be stored air-dry in sealed containers for 
several years.  They are most easily sown in a cold 
frame immediately after ripening, in sand or a sand-
humus mixture.  Spring planting of seeds collected 
earlier requires stratification in moist sand or 
vermiculite for 60-90 days at 5° C.  Seedbeds should 
be kept moist and shaded until late in the summer.  
Germination rates are often low.  Softwood cuttings 
taken in summer, treated with rooting promoter, and 
rooted under mist provide good starts. cuttings of 
mature wood taken soon after leaves fall also are 
reported to be effective.  Two or three year-old 
seedlings are used for field planting. 
 
General: Flowering and fruit production begin at 
about 5-10 years, with abundant fruit crops produced 
at about 4-year intervals.  An optimal seedbed for 
germination is exposed, constantly moist mineral 
soil.  Mild intensity burning and scarification also 
encourage regeneration.  Individuals of speckled 
alder are fast growing, but short-lived.

Most new stems in alder stands are formed through 
sprouting from rhizomes, which may result in dense, 
clonal thickets.  Such sprouting is independent of 
aboveground stem damage, but root crown sprouts 
may contribute strongly to regeneration following 
top-kill from fires.  Sprouting rhizomes are usually 
within about 5 centimeters of the soil surface.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;

Alders have relatively few insect or disease 
problems, although alder psyllid and alder blight 
aphid can damage the leaves.    
 
Mild spring and early summer fires that kill only the 
aerial stems are recommended for regeneration of 
speckled alder.  Severe fires that remove the organic 
layer and expose and char root crowns can 
completely eliminate sprouting in speckled alder or 
significantly retard regeneration.  Fire intervals of 
about 9 years are adequate to keep speckled alder 
stands at an early successional stage.  Longer 
intervals may encourage the expansion of alder 
thickets at the expense of other forest types.   
 
Alder patches of various age classes can be 
maintained by staggered cutting and provide the best 
wildlife cover.  Spring and winter cutting produces 
the most rapid sprout growth.

and hair.  The native Americans of the Pacific 
Northwest extracted a red dye from the inner bark, 
which was used to dye fishnets.  Oregon tribes used 
the innerbark to make a reddish-brown dye for basket 
decorations (Murphey 1959).  Yellow dye made from 
red alder catkins was used to color quills.   
 
A mixture of red alder sap and charcoal was used by 
the Cree and Woodland tribes for sealing seams in 
canoes and as a softener for bending boards for 
toboggans (Moerman 1998).   
 
Wood and fiber: Red alder wood is used in the 
production of wooden products such as food dishes, 
furniture, sashes, doors, millwork, cabinets, paneling 
and brush handles.  It is also used in fiber-based 
products such as tissue and writing paper.   
In Washington and Oregon, it was largely used for 
smoking salmon.  The Indians of Alaska used the 
hallowed trunks for canoes (Sargent 1933).   
 
Medicinal: The North American Indians used the 
bark to treat many complaints such a headaches, 
rheumatic pains, internal injuries, and diarrhea 
(Moerman 1998).   
 
The Salinan used an extract of the bark of alder trees 
to treat cholera, stomach cramps, and stomachaches 
(Heinsen 1972).  The extract was made with 20 parts 
water to 1 part fresh or aged bark.  The bark contains 
salicin, a chemical similar to aspirin (Uchytil 1989).   
 
Infusions made from the bark of red alders were 
taken to treat anemia, colds, congestion, and to 
relieve pain.  Bark infusions were taken as a laxative 
and to regulate menstruation.  The Pomo boiled the 
bark in water to make a wash to treat skin irritations 
and sores (Goodrich et al. 1980).  Bark poultices 
were applied to reduce swelling.  Chewing the bark 
helped to heal sores and ulcers in the mouth.   
 
Externally the sap was applied to cuts and a poultice 
of the bark has been applied to eczema, sores, and 
aches (Moerman 1998).  The twigs were made into 
infusions that served as liniments for sprains and 
backaches.   
 
Basketry:  The roots of red alder were used in baskets 
made by the Hupa, Whilkut, Nongatl, Lassik, 
Wailaki, Yurok Wiyot, and Pomo tribes (Merrill 
1923).  Red alder roots form the brown pattern in

California.   
 
Wildlife: Deer and elk eat the leaves, twigs, and buds.  
Red alder seeds attract many bird and small mammal 
species including redpolls, siskins, goldfinches, and 
mice.  Most of the seeds remain on the tree well into 
the fall and winter months, providing valuable 
resources for seed-eating birds, insects and mammals 
when other foods are scarce.  Beavers eat the bark 
and build dams and lodges with the stems.  Red alder 
trees provide valuable nesting for birds and thermal 
cover for black-tailed deer and other wildlife.   
 
Livestock: Horses, cattle, sheep and goats browse on 
the leaves, twigs and buds of young alder trees.   
 
Conservation and erosion control: Red alder is an 
excellent species for re-establishing woodlands.  The 
trees are used in forested riparian buffers to help 
reduce stream bank erosion, protect water quality, 
and enhance aquatic environments.  Plantings of red 
alder are effective in controlling erosion on steep 
slopes in disturbed areas (Uchytil 1989).  These fast-
growing trees help to prevent soil erosion because of 
their dense canopy cover and thick litter layer that 
forms within the first 3 to 5 years.  The leaf litter is 
high in nitrogen content (Labadie 1978).   
 
Wood: Red alder wood is a high quality hardwood 
with a fine, even textured, cherry-like grain that is 
important commercially in the Pacific Northwest 
(Labadie 1978).  It is used for cabinetry and furniture 
making as well as a variety of other purposes 
including plywood, veneers, paneling, pulp, and 
firewood.   
 
Other: The small cones cling to the branches long 
after the leaves have fallen and make decorative 
additions to flower arrangements (Brenzel 2001).

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Description TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Description='General: Birch family (Betulaceae).  Red alder is a 
deciduous tree native to the Pacific Northwest of 
North America.  The trees are medium-sized, 
reaching various heights from 15 to 30 meters tall 
when mature.  These fast-growing trees often grow 1 
meter per year until 20 years of age.  The trees can 
live to 100 years of age with trunks from 36 to 46 cm 
in diameter.  A shrub form occurs when the trees 
 
 
grow in open exposed areas.  The branches are 
slender and spreading.  The thin bark is generally 
smooth, ashy gray to grayish-brown, and is usually 
covered with white lichens as it ages.  The inner bark 
is reddish brown.   
 
The alternately arranged leaves are dark green, 
simple and broadly ovate.  The leaves are 6 to 15 cm 
long with a pointed tip.  The leaf edges are serrated 
or softly lobed and slightly rolled under, giving a 
dark-green edging effect from the underside of the 
leaf.  The undersides of the leaves are rusty colored 
and covered with fine soft hairs.   
 
The trees are monoecious, bearing both female 
flowers and male catkins.  The tassel-like catkins 
grow in cluster of two to four.  The catkins are 
greenish-yellow and 10 to 16 cm long.  The flowers 
appear in spring either before or with the leaves.  The 
flowers develop into small-scaled cones (fruits) that 
are 2 to 2.5cm long and 1 to 1.5 cm across.  Each 
cone contains from 50 to 100 seeds that are tiny flat 
nutlets.  The abundant seeds are wind dispersed from 
May to winter months.   
 
Red alder trees invade clearings or burned-over areas 
and forms temporary forests (Grimm 1967).  Over 
time, red 
alders build 
up the soil 
with their 
copious litter, 
and enriched 
it with 
nitrogen 
compounds 
formed by 
symbiotic 
bacteria that 
live in little 
nodules on 
their roots.  
Red alder 
stands are 
eventually 
succeeded by 
Douglas fir, 
western 
hemlock, and 
sitka spruce.   
Distribution: 
Red alder is 
most often observed in moist areas within 200 
kilometers of the Pacific Coast of North America 
from Alaska to Southern California at elevations 
below 762 meters (Uchytil 1989).  It also occurs

along streams and lakes from the Yukon Territory 
and British Columbia south through the Rocky 
Mountain region to Colorado and New Mexico, and 
along Sierra Nevada to Lower California (Britton 
1908).  Red alder has spread to upland areas since 
European contact because of increased disturbance, 
such as logging, which opens up sites for 
colonization.   
 
For current distribution, please consult the Plant 
Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
site.   
 
Habitat: Red alder trees are often associated with 
mixed evergreen forests and redwood forests in 
coastal areas.  The trees grow in riparian forests 
along streams, in swamps and in marshy areas.   
 
' WHERE symbol='alru2';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Adaptation TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Adaptation='Red alder has two adaptations that allow the trees to 
colonize bare infertile substrates: 1) the roots have 
nodules that house symbiotic bacteria which fix 
nitrogen from the air contained in the pores of the 
soil, and 2) the seeds need sunlight to germinate.   
 
Actinomycetes (filamentous bacteria) in the genus 
Frankia invade alders through their root hairs and 
stimulate cell division, forming nodules on the roots 
(Pojar &amp. Mackinnon 1994).  Species of Frankia 
remove nitrogen from the air and ‘fix’ it in a form 
useful to plants (Ibid.).  Red alder provides a home 
for the actinomycete, which in turn ‘leaks’ some of 
the nitrogen, making it available for the alder (Ibid.).  
Alder improves soils fertility by fixing atmospheric 
nitrogen in a form that can be used by other plants.  
This conversion is why forests stands containing 
alder generally have a rich understory (Ibid.).   
 
Young trees can survive disturbance by resprouting 
from the stumps (Labdie 1978).  Red alder trees 
tolerate flooding and can grow in areas where the 
water is brackish (Brenzel 2001).   
 
' WHERE symbol='alru2';

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Red alder prefers moist, well-drained, deep sandy 
loams (Labadie 1978) and full sun.  Quick growing 
red alders can be planted with slower growing trees 
such as oak to provide quick screening (Lowry 1999).   
 
Propagation from Seed: Red alder trees are generally 
propagated from seed.  Mature seeds can be collected 
beginning in May.  Spring sown seeds of Alnus rubra 
should germinate successfully as long as they are not 
covered as the seeds require sunlight to germinate 
and germinate best in full sun.  Sow the seeds in 
containers or seed trays containing a slow release 
 
 
fertilizer.  Firm the medium and place the seeds 
thinly and evenly on top.  When large enough to 
handle, the seedlings can be placed into individual 
pots.  If growth is sufficient, they may be planted into 
their permanent positions in the summer, if not they 
can be planted the following spring.   
 
The seeds do not require pretreatment, however 
germination can be improved by cold stratification 
for 1 to 3 months (Emery 1988).  To do this, mix the 
seeds with three parts moistened peat moss or 
vermiculite.  Place the mixture into an airtight jar or 
sealed plastic bag in the refrigerator for 1 to 3 months 
before planting.  This process is not necessary if the 
seeds are planted in the fall, as the temperatures and 
moisture over winter will accomplish the same 
purpose.

well-drained soil in full sun or partial shade.  Allium 
species do especially well in raised beds for drainage.  
Water them after planting and then let the rains come.  
Weed around the plants.  Most animals don t eat wild 
onions.  This species of wild onion can be invasive. 
 
If establishing the plant by seed, plant the seeds in the 
fall in pots in partial shade.  Scatter the seeds on top 
of a well-drained soil.  Sprinkle a thin layer of dirt 
over the top and place quarter-inch gravel over the 
soil.  Water the pots and keep them slightly moist.  
Stop watering when the leaves shrivel in the early

leaves are alternate, compound and with 3 leaflets.  
Leaflets are broadly lanceolate to ovate.  The leaf 
stalks (petioles) are 2-10 cm long.  The hogpeanut 
produces two sorts of flowers.  The first is an 
unbranched, elongated inflorescence with pedicellate 
flowers maturing from the bottom up.  These flowers 
open before fertilization and are usually cross-
pollinated (chasmogamous).  The other flowers are 
self-fertilized without opening (cleistogamous) and 
are produced on creeping branches near the ground. 
The fruit is a sickle-shaped, thin-walled legume, 4-6 
mm long. 
Distribution: For current distribution, please consult

The bark was also harvested in autumn and boiled 
into a deep red-wine color and drank to alleviate  
 
ulcers or applied externally to wash open sores.  The 
Moapa Paiute boiled the leaves in a quantity of water 
and used it as a bath for muscular pains and for sore 
feet.  The Shoshone mashed the roots and boiled 
them to make a poultice for swellings, or the 
decoctions used as an antiseptic wash.  A tea from the 
boiled roots can be taken for stomachache or more 
commonly as a tonic for general debility following 
colds.  The Pima in the Southwest made an infusion 
of dried roots which was taken for colds.  They also 
chewed the roots and swallowed them or made a 
decoction of the roots which was taken for coughs.  
Spanish settlers in California used the plant as a 
liniment for skin troubles and as a tea for disorders of 
the blood.

Americans still gather the plant today. The Kawaiisu, 
for example, boiled the root and a decoction was then 
drunk hot to alleviate colds and coughing.  The 
Tubatulabal of southern California for colds also took 
a decoction of the plant.  The Kamia of Imperial 
Valley pulverized the seeds of yerba mansa in the 
mortar and the meal was then cooked as mush in a 
pot or baked as bread in hot ashes.  The Yokuts 
pounded up the root and soaked it in water.  The 
water was then drunk for a bad stomach.  The 
Costanoan made a decoction from the root, which 
was used, for menstrual cramps and for general pain 
remedy.  A tea was used to wash sores and the plant, 
dried and powdered, was sprinkled on wounds as a 
disinfectant.  The Cahuilla peeled, cut up, squeezed,

According to Kelly 
Kindscher (1987), 
“groundnut is a 
common native food plant of temperate, eastern 
North America.  Its distribution reaches west to the 
wet margins of prairies, where it was once used 
extensively by the Native Americans.” 
 
Groundnut was a source of food among the Omaha, 
Dakota, Santee Sioux, Cheyenne, Osage, Pawnee, 
and Hidatsa (Gilmore 1913, Grinnell 1962, Matthews 
1961, Wilson 1987).  Groundnut was excavated from 
four Ozark bluff-dweller sites in Arkansas.  The 
Ozark peoples are regarded as pre-Columbian 
(Beardsley 1939).  Groundnuts “roots” were dug in 
the winter.  The tubers were gathered all year but 
were best when harvested from late Fall through 
early spring.  They were eaten raw, cooked, or dried 
and ground for flour.  Some of the “roots” were 
boiled, peeled, and dried for storage.  The seeds are 
cooked and eaten like peas in summer. 
 
Groundnut was also an important food of New 
England colonists (Hedrick 1919).  Once the 
colonists discovered the groundnut, they enacted a 
town law to prevent Indians from digging groundnut 
on English land.  Groundnut tubers are a good source

percent protein by dry weight, or about three times 
more than potatoes or any other widely used 
vegetable root (Yanovsky and Kingsbury 1938, Watt 
and Merrill 1963).

(Apios americana) is a perennial herb from slender 
rhizomes with tuberous thickenings 1.3-4 cm (0.5-1.6 
in) thick, and stems twining or climbing over other 
plants.  The leaves are alternate, pinnately, egg-
shaped, 2-10 cm (3/4-4 in) long, 1.8-7 cm (0.7-2.7 in) 
wide, and sometimes hairy.  The flowers are in 
rounded clusters among leaves.  Groundnut blooms 
from July to October.  The flowers have 5 parts, the 
upper one round, white and reddish brown, the 2 side 
wings curved down and brown-purple, the lower 2 
petals sickle-shaped and brownish red.  The fruits are 
dry, straight or slightly curved, narrow, and 5-10 mm 
(3/16-3/8 in) long.  The fleshy legume fruits are 6-12

The fiber was particularly useful in making fishing 
and carrying nets, for string and for ropes, and to 
some extent for weaving rough cloth.  In California, 
Indian hemp and milkweed are used somewhat 
interchangeably for cordage.  The Luiseño of 
southern California for their dance regalia used 
Indian hemp. the golden eagle or other feathers are 
tied to netting for the dance skirt for men (Merriam 
1955).  The wild hemp was also used by the 
Chemeweve for snares for otter and rabbits (Ibid.)  
 
Dogbane is very important to tribes in the Columbia 
Plateau in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho for 
basketry.  The Quinalt, Kalispel, Nez Perce, Spokane, 
Umatilla, Wasco, Wishram, Yakima, and Klikitat 
used dogbane for cordage and basketry. 
 
Families use the native twine to tie together the 
frames for their winter lodges.  They used it to sew 
cattails and tules into sturdy mats to cover these 
frames and to serve as carpeting, furniture, beds, and 
utensils.  Dip nets, set nets, and seines were made of 
dogbane.  The nets were strong enough to hold the 
giant sturgeon caught in the Columbia River. 
 
Of all the important uses for Indian hemp, the 
itatamat , or &quot.counting the days&quot. ball, was perhaps 
the most significant for the people themselves.  From 
the time of her marriage, a woman would record a 
calendar of her life s events by tying knots on a 
length of hemp as important events occurred.  She 
marked births, deaths, and other extraordinary days 
with beads, shells or other talismans.  When the ball 
got too large to handle easily, she started a new ball.  
 
Flat twined bags (&quot.sally bags&quot.), round twined bags 
and basketry caps were made with dogbane.  Soft 
bags were made using twine from Indian hemp or 
milkweed decorated with cornhusk imbrication. 
Basket bottoms and top margins were of woven cedar 
bark. These soft bags conform to the shape of a load 
of roots of camas or other plants.   
 
Later explorers reported that the Nez Perce and other 
tribes stored berries, roots, and nuts in bags about one 
by two feet, and used larger bags up to three feet long 
for clothing and other personal effects.  Early visitor 
to the Mid-Columbia also described piles of filled 
bags in the corners or hung along the wall in native 
homes.  One weaver estimated that it took two to 
three months to twine a large root-storage bag.

Ethnobotanic: Indian hemp is harvested for fiber.  
The stems are cut in the fall. they are then split open 
and the long, silky fibers removed.  The fibers are 
then twisted into string, which provides cordage.  
String, thread, rope, baskets, snares, netting, and 
clothing were made from the bast fibers of the Indian 
hemp plant because they are so silky yet strong.  
Cordage was then used to make tump straps, belts, 
netted bags, hairnets, and ceremonial regalia (capes, 
skirts, and head-dresses).

As a medium of trade, barter, or wager, the bags in 
the early days were considered only the wrapping or 
container for the dried roots they held.  The largest of 
the bags would hold just under a half-bushel or nearly 
four dry gallons of camas or bitterroot bulbs.  Now, 
the bags themselves are highly valued as trade items.  
The flat twined bags have been widely traded to other 
tribes, such as the Crow and Blackfeet of Montana.  
 
Today, the wapanii sapk ukt, or &quot.twined handbag,&quot. is 
the most popular form of flat twined bags.  It is 
carried with great pride as part of ceremonial regalia, 
the twined handbag emphasizing the distinct cultural 
heritage of the person who carries it.  Today, cotton 
twine usually replaces Indian hemp in basketry. 
however, very special ceremonial bags are still made 
with Indian hemp.  
 
The biochemical constituents in Indian hemp are 
apocynin, apocynamarin, cymarin, and and rosin. 
Indian hemp could be dried, crushed, and then 
snuffed for coughs in head colds.  The root was made 
into a tea and was used to help a baby’s cold, 
earache, headache, nervousness, dizziness, worms 
and insanity.  This tea was also taken for heart 
palpitations, but care should be observed if using it 
for cardiac disorders.  It acts as a vaso-constrictor, 
slows and strengthens the heartbeat, and raises blood 
pressure.  The root could also be used as an emetic, 
diaphoretic, antispasmodic, cathartic, anodyne, 
hypnotic, laxative, treats vomiting, diarrhea, 
hydrocephalus, urinary difficulties, dropsy, jaundice, 
liver problems, and stimulates the digestive system. It 
has been successfully employed for alcoholism.  A 
wash made of crushed root can be shampooed into 
the hair to stimulate growth, remove dandruff and 
head lice.  The milky juice can remove warts. A 
poultice of the leaves reduces tumors, hemorrhoids, 
and inflammation of the testicles.  The poultice 
placed over the eyelids works on opthalmia and eye 
diseases.  The leaves ground into powder can dress 
wounds, sores and ulcers. 
 
Erosion Control: The extensive root system on Indian 
hemp provides good slope and streambank 
stabilization and erosion control functions.  The 
flowers are attractive to bees, butterflies, and other 
insects.  The plant itself is toxic. so many forms of 
wildlife do not eat it. Indian hemp is considered a 
noxious weed because of its invasive nature and its 
toxicity to domestic livestock. 
 
Invasive Potential: This plant can be invasive in 
orchards and cultivated areas, so is not a garden 
plant.  The small, inconspicuous flowers and weedy 
growth form doesn t have horticultural appeal.

Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web

places near riparian areas along streams, springs, 
levees, roadsides, and waste places.  This well-known 
source of fibers is found in damp places, below 5,000 
feet altitude through most of California, even here 
and there in the deserts.  Indian hemp grows 
throughout California north to British Colombia and 
east across the United States. 
 
Indian hemp is found near the borders of woods, 
along paths, in clearings, or in disturbed, waste places 
like ditches.  It is no longer very common in 
California, and many traditional gathering sites are 
gone. 
 
' WHERE symbol='apca';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Indian hemp plants are not widely available.  
Transplanting bare rootstock or collecting seed for 
direct reseeding into the ground will be necessary in 
most areas.  Use of plants which have been 
traditionally used by the ancestors of that place, and 
which are adapted to the climate, soils, and site 
conditions of that place, is optimum.   
 
Seed Collections: Collect seeds after pods have 
ripened, but before they have split open.  This usually 
occurs in late summer, from August to September.  
The seeds are wind dispersed, so be careful when 
gathering to place them in a paper or burlap bag to 
avoid losing them.  
 
Seeds can be directly sown into the ground in the fall.  
The seed is very viable. Planting seed the first fall

after collecting seeds maximizes revegetation 
success.  It is not certain how long you can store the 
seeds.  Irrigation the first summer after planting will 
improve plant survival.  Once root are established, 
extra watering will be unnecessary.  Indian hemp is 
fairly aggressive, and will usually out-compete other 
plant species on its own.  The latex in stems and 
leaves protects the plant from most herbivores. 
 
Live Plant Collections: Plants can be divided almost 
any time of year, but revegetation is most successful 
in fall after the plants senesce.  Harvest and planting 
of Indian hemp is optimum in October, or just after 
the first fall rains.  Stalks should be cut to a 
conveniently manageable length before digging up 
plants (approximately 25 to 35 cm).  
 
No more than 1/4 of the plants in an area should be 
collected. a depth of 15 cm (6 in) is sufficiently deep 
for digging plugs. This will leave enough plants and 
roots to grow back during the following growing 
season.  
 
Live transplants should be planted as soon as 
possible.  Plants should be transported and stored in a 
cool location prior to planting.  Plugs may be split 
into smaller units, generally no smaller than 6 x 6 cm 
(2.4 x 2.4 in) with healthy roots and tops.  Weeds in 
the plugs should be removed by hand.  For ease in 
transport, soil may be washed gently from roots.  The 
roots should always remain moist or in water until 
planted.  Roots should be kept moist after the plants 
have been dug up.  Planting should occur at a spacing 
of approximately one-foot centers.  Plants should be 
watered in. Irrigation may be necessary through the 
first dry season.  By the second year, roots should 
have extended to the water table and irrigation should 
no longer be necessary.  
 
' WHERE symbol='apca';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='When used for fiber, Indian hemp is collected in the 
autumn after the leaves have begun to senesce or dry 
up and the stalks turn a deep reddish brown color.  
Plants are cut at the base of the stem.  Cutting the 
plants appears to stimulate new growth in the spring. 
so as many stalks as possible are cut.  Plants are then 
split open and the fibers removed and processed into 
cordage.  After winter, the fibers have disintegrated 
and the stems are still standing, but full of mush or 
empty.  The fibers can t be removed after one winter.  
 
There are only two known large sites for traditional 
harvest of Indian hemp for fiber in California. one at 
Yosemite and one near Santa Rosa.  In the Columbia 
Basin, though Indian hemp might be found in many 
 
 
low-lying areas, certain stands of hemp grew higher 
and straighter, and the long strands produced were 
prized for the strength of the twine made from them.  
So special was this resource area that violent conflict 
(otherwise uncommon) occurred between Wanapam 
Sahaptins and Columbia Salish over access to the 
hemp (Relander 1956) 
 
Vast quantities of fiber plants are required for nets, 
regalia, and cordage.  Blackburn and Anderson 
(1993) quote Craig Bates of the Yosemite Museum 
that it takes approximately five stalks of milkweed or 
Indian hemp to manufacture one foot of cordage.  A 
Sierra Miwok feather skirt or cape contain about 100 
feet of cordage made from approximately 500 plant 
stalks, while a deer net 40 feet in length (Barrett and 
Gifford 1933:178) contained some 7,000 feet of 
cordage, which would have required the harvesting of 
a staggering 35,000 plant stalks.  Therefore, 
propagation and conservation of this species for fiber 
is very important for production of traditionally 
manufactured cordage, which is still used today.  
 
Both milkweed and dogbane are burned in the fall to 
eliminate dead stalks and stimulate new growth.  
Burning causes new growth to have taller, straighter 
stems (with longer fibers). It also stimulates flower 
and seed production. ' WHERE symbol='apca';

campestris) is a smooth-stemmed biennial herb 3-10 
dm (1-4 ft) tall with stems arising singly from a 
prominent taproot.  This species is without the typical 
sagebrush odor that is common to most Artemisia 
species.  The basal leaves are numerous, sometimes 
persistent and sometimes deciduous.  These leaves 
are 2-3x compound, and each leaf is 2-10 dm long 
and 1-4 dm wide.  The cauline leaves are less divided 
and become more reduced as they ascend the stem.  
The inflorescence of numerous small heads is an 
elongate but narrow panicle.  The fruits are dry, 
smooth, broadly cylindrical achenes.  The mature 
achenes are sub-cylindric and hairless.  Sagewort 
wormwood flowers from August to September.

also found in the plant and may be responsible for 
some of its medicinal effects (Kinscher 1992).  
However, it is poisonous in large doses.  The Food

unsafe herb containing “a volatile oil which is an 
active narcotic poison” (Duke 1985).

was drank to relieve coughs and applied externally to 
relieve eczema.  The Shuswap use a decoction of 
sagewort wormwood for coughs, colds, and 
tuberculosis (Moerman 1986).  They also make a 
poultice of steamed branches and apply it to bruises 
and sores.

spreads vigorously from a prominent taproot.  Plants

• 
In greenhouse conditions, it is best to dig up and 
separate plants in late fall or winter.  This is the 
“quiescent” period that follows seed maturation, 
and leaves are senescent (dried up and brown 
colored).  
•  Split the plant clump into pieces by hand, then 
cut the plant into sections, each with one or more 
buds. 
•  For dividing the whole plant, gently loosen the 
soil around the plant, taking care to not damage 
the roots, and then lift the plant gently with a 
pitchfork.  Shake off as much soil from the roots 
as possible. 
•  Divide the plant into smaller pieces by hand, 
retaining only healthy, vigorous sections, each 
with new buds.  
•  Replant the divisions as soon as possible.  It is 
important the plants don’t dry out, so if 
replanting is delayed a couple of hours, dip the 
plants briefly in water and keep them in a sealed 
plastic bag in a cool, shady place until you are 
ready to plant them. 
•  Cut back the old top-growth and replant the 
divided plant sections to the same depth as 
before. 
•  When replanting, ensure that the roots are well 
spread out in the planting hole and the plant 
firmed in.  Water newly planted divisions 
thoroughly. take care not to expose the roots by 
washing away soil when watering. 
•  Plants should be planted in the full sun in a light, 
loose soil.  Plants should be planted on 12-18” 
centers. 
•  As plants are becoming established, the rooting 
zone needs to be kept moist.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_='Propagation by seed: When the soil has warmed to at 
least 45ºF (7ºC) in the spring, sow hardy Artemisia 
species where they are to flowers.  
•  Seeds can also be sown in pots or seed trays and 
either out-planted in their final positions in late 
fall or over-wintered in a cold frame to be out-
planted in spring.  This technique is particularly 
useful in gardens with clay soil that is slow to 
warm up in spring. 
•  The two main methods of sowing outdoors are 
broadcast and drills.  For both, prepare the 
seedbed first by digging over the soil to one 
spade depth, then rake over and firm. 
•  Broadcast Sowing: Sprinkle seeds thinly and 
evenly on the surface of the prepared seedbed 
and rake them in lightly.  Label the seedbeds, 
then water the area gently, but thoroughly, with a 
fine spray. 
•  Sowing in drills: Use either a trowel tip or the 
corner of a hoe, mark out shallow drill holes 3-6” 
(8-15 cm) apart, depending on the ultimate size 
of the plant.  Sow seeds thinly and evenly by 
sprinkling or placing them along each drill at the 
appropriate depth.  Carefully cover with soil and 
firm.  Label each row and water gently but 
thoroughly with a fine spray. 
•  To prevent overcrowding, the seedlings usually 
need to be thinned.  To minimize disturbance to 
a seedling being retained, press the soil around it 
after thinning the adjacent seedlings. 
•  Water the newly establishing seedlings fairly 
frequently until the roots have developed.

General:  Douglas’ sagewort is an aromatic perennial forb in the 
sunflower family (Asteraceae) that is native to the western United 
States. It is rhizomatous and has many slender, 3-5 ft. tall stems. 
The leaf blades are 3-6 in. long, and can be as wide as 2 in. across. 
In color, they are green to grey-green, silvery-white underneath, In 
shape, they are narrowly elliptic to widely oblanceolate with 3-5 
lateral lobes (Shultz, 2006,2014). The upper-surface is sparsely 
hairy, while the lower surface is densely hairy. The grey flowering 
heads are leafy-bracted panicles with short matted hairs. The 
disciform heads are 0.1 – 0.2 in. diameter, inconspicuous in 
clusters, with pistilate flowers (5-9) and disk flowers (6-25). 
Bloom is from mid-spring through late fall. The fruits 0.05 x 
0.1in.) are grey brown. 
 
Distribution:  Douglas’ sagewort is native to western North America from Washington and Idaho, through Oregon, in 
Nevada, through California and the Baja Peninsular of Mexico. It is found along the Pacific coast and in riparian corridors 
from sea level to 7,200 feet in elevation (USDA). For current distribution, please consult the Plant Profile page for this 
species on the PLANTS Web site. 
 
Habitat:  Douglas’ sagewort is found primarily in drainages and riparian corridors (Shultz 2006).  It grows well in dry or 
moist shaded sites and is tolerant or a range of soil types. It may be found in meadows at higher elevations.

early spring (ESNERR, 2001). If seeding must be done later in the spring, stratification may be of benefit (Deitschman, 
1974).  Establishment from transplants is also successful as one- and 2-year-old seedlings can be field-planted early in the 
spring, as fall transplanting is generally not successful (Deitschman 1974). Irrigation will assist with establishment for the 
first year or two depending upon the location. It would be essential for drier sites.  Douglas’ sagewort can also be effectively 
propagated from rhizomes, using a protocol developed for Artemisia vulgaris, which showed that ~75% of 2-cm long 
rhizome sections produced roots and shoots (Klingeman et al. 2004). Once established, Douglas’ sagewort spreads easily 
from rhizomes and because of this, a few established plants can effectively populate a suitable site.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_SeedsandPlantProduction='Collection and storage:  Determination of fruit ripeness can be difficult because of the small fruit size. Douglas’ sagewort is 
ready to harvest when fruits can be easily removed from the heads by shaking and are too hard to be easily crushed with a 
thumbnail. Because the fruit matures so late in the season, it often has to be harvested quickly after maturity to avoid losses 
and storm damage. The heads are clipped, placed in paper bags to dry, then rubbed over screens to remove the chaff and 
stored in a dry cooler (ESNERR, 2001). For propagation, fruits are sown into plug trays filled with potting mix then lightly 
covered with more potting mix. The trays are misted with an automatic irrigation system. Fifteen days after germination, 
seedlings are transplanted into larger containers, then moved into a lath house, keeping them moist. Transplant survival 
averages 85% and one or two year old plants can be used for planting out (Young 2001).

It is purported to have potent medicinal properties.  
The leaves contain tannin, an astringent, and have 
been used as a tea to relieve diarrhea, lessen fevers, 
as a purgative, to ease eye inflammations, and to 
relieve sore throat.  The roots were used by the 
Blackfeet as an antidiarrheal. 
 
Other Uses.  The stoloniferous growth form aids in 
substrate stabilization and erosion control.  
Songbirds, such as snow buntings and rosey finches 
east the seeds.  Rabbits, cottontails, chipmunks, and 
ground squirrels eat the foliage and seeds.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Description='General: Rose Family (Rosaceae).  Pacific 
silverweed is a low-growing perennial native herb 
which spreads by creeping stolons.  It often forms 
dense tangles.  The pinnately compound and alternate 
leaves are all basal, glossy green, with silver 
undersides.  The leaflets are deeply notched and 
toothes, 3-50 cm long, with 5-10 leaflets per side.  
The leaves dry out and become brown in the winter, 
but remain intact.  The buttercup-like yellow flowers 
have 5 petals, 5 sepals, and have many stamens and 
pistils.  Pacific silverweed flowers form singly at the 
nodes of the stolons.  The petals are 7-20 mm long.  
The 2 mm fruits are oval, flattened, and dark red-
brown.  
 
Distribution: For current distribution, please consult 
the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site.  It is found in the Pacific 
Northwest and New England into Labrador and 
Newfoundland.  It is found at elevations below 150 m 
throughout coastal North America and Asia. 
 
Habitat: Pacific silverweed typically occurs in high 
tidal marshes, at or above the mean high water, where 
it is often associated with tufted hairgrass 
(Deschampsia caespitosa) and Lyngby sedge (Carex. 
lyngbyei).  It can also be found in nontidal freshwater 
meadows and marshes.  In these situations, it is often 
associated with creeping buttercup (Ranunculus 
repens), several species of grasses and sedges, and 
the invasive reed canarygrass (Phalaris 
arundinacea).

food in the northwest coast region, including Alaska 
and Washington.  Silverweed roots were dug in large 
quantities, cooked, and often dried for winter and 
used as a trade item.  The roots were generally 
harvested in the fall, after the leaves had started to 
dies for the winter.  Clumps of roots were pried up 
with a digging stick, and the edible roots – long and 
sometimes spindle-shaped, with striated, brown 
skins, were broken off.  The roots were always 
cooked through boiling or roasting to remove the 
bitter flavor.  After cooking, they taste like parsnips.  
They were often harvested and cooked together with 
springbank clover rhizomes (Trifolium wormskioldii).  
Pacific silverweed roots were also dried, before or 
after cooking, and stored for the winter.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Pacific silverweed can be propagated easily from 
container or bare root stock, as it produces many 
stolons and rhizomes.  It can also be propagated from 
seed. Pacific silverweed is found in wetland areas 
with very wet soils.  It will tolerate brackish 
conditions, so it can be used in salt marsh and 
floodplain restoration.  It provides good groundcover, 
however, it can be invasive. 
 
Pacific silverweed spreads vigorously from both 
stolons and rhizomes.  In greenhouse conditions, it is 
best to dig up and separate plants in the late fall or 
winter.  This is the quiescent period that follows seed 
maturation and leaves are senescent.  They should be 
planted in full sun in a light, loose soil.  Plants should 
be planted on 12-18 inch centers.  They will fill into 
solid stands in one year.  Plants need to be kept moist 
with frequent watering.  Lightly fertize the plants 
during the growing season.  Pacific silverweed 
tolerates brackish conditions.  Plants may need to be 
protected from hervivores, such as rabbits or gophers.

The Blackfeet used the leaves of prairie sandwort as a 
preservative for stored meat (Hellson  
 
and Gadd 1974).  It was known by the Chilcotin as 
horse food (Myers et al. Unpubl. Notes 1988). 
 
According to Moerman (1986) Artemisia frigida was 
used in the following ways: 
•  The Chippewa used it as an anti-convulsive, a 
cure for “fits,” burned leaves to disinfect a 
contagious patient, inhaled a moxa for 
biliousness, put it on wounds to stop bleeding, 
made a decoction of the roots for a stimulant or 
tonic, and placed fresh leaves in nostrils and 
mouth as protection when “working with the 
dead.” 
•  Montana Indians used a decoction as a remedy 
for lung troubles. 
•  The Navaho-Ramah used a decoction of leaves 
to alleviate coughing, made a hot poultice of 
leaves for toothaches, and used the root for “life 
medicine.”

Ethnobotanical: The Cheyenne used prairie sagewort 
ceremonially as a smudge for purification in the Sun 
Dance (Hart 1976. Kinscher 1992).  The Delaware-
Okl chewed the leaves as a ceremonial medicine.  
The Blackfeet chewed the leaves of prairie sagewort 
for heartburn (McClintock 1923, Hellson 1974) and 
applied the leaves to wounds to reduce swelling.  
Prairie sagewort was also used to treat nosebleed by 
stuffing the nose with the soft leaves.  The roots and 
tops were boiled and drank as a tea for “mountain 
fever.”  Other tribes, who used this species of sage 
include the Arapaho, Comanche, Gros Ventre, Cree, 
Navaho, Tewa, and Ute (Nickerson 1966, Carlson 
and Jones 1939, Hart 1976, Thwaites 1905, Denig 
1855, Elmore 1944, Robbins et al. 1916, Chamberlin 
1909). 
 
Cheyenne women used prairie sagewort to correct 
menstrual irregularity (Hart 1976).  During the time 
of the month when women left their lodges and went 
to the menstrual hut, they drank tea made from the 
root of Artemisia frigida or the leaves of the white 
sage (Artemisia ludoviciana).  The Dakota, Omaha, 
Pawnee, and Ponca women used a decoction of the 
plant for irregular menstrual periods.

The lactone glycosides, santonin and artemisin, are 
probably found in all Artemisia species and account 
for their anthelmintic properties (Moore 1979).  
Thujone, a terpene-like ketone and essential oil, is 
also found in the plant and may be responsible for 
some of its medicinal effects (Kinscher 1992).  
However, it is poisonous in large doses.  The Food 
and Drug Administration classifies Artemisia as an 
unsafe herb containing “a volatile oil which is an 
active narcotic poison” (Duke 1985).  Although the 
native species of Artemisia have never been listed as 
official drugs in the U.S. Pharmacopoeia, A. frigida is 
listed as a source of camphor (Kindscher 1992). 
 
Wildlife: Sagebrush furnishes essential cover for 
many of the smaller desert animals (Martin et al. 
1951).  Its foliage and flower clusters constitute most 
of the diet of the sage grouse, and these parts together 
with the twigs are the primary source of food for 
antelope and mule deer.  Range cattle also make good

use of sagebrush as forage.  Other mammals, which 
browse the foliage and stems, include jackrabbits, 
black-tailed rabbits, white-tailed rabbits, cottontails, 
chipmunks, gophers, ground squirrels, and various 
species of mice, prairie dogs, kangaroo rats, and 
white-throated wood rats.  Elk and mountain sheep 
also browse on the foliage and twigs.

sagewort is a spreading shrublet 1-4 dm (3.9-15.7 in) 
tall, pleasantly fragrant, whitish or grayish tomentose, 
and arising from a tough, woody crown.  Tomentose 
means having dense, velvety, fuzzy hairs.  The leaves 
are also tomentose and abundant, clustered toward 
the base and scattered along the stem.  The lower 
leaves are petiolate, 12 mm (0.5 in) long, with the 
upper leaves becoming sessile.  The inflorescence is a

• 
In greenhouse conditions, it is best to dig up and 
separate plants in late fall or winter.  This is the 
“quiescent” period that follows seed maturation, 
and leaves are senescent (dried up and brown 
colored).  
•  Split the plant clump into pieces by hand, then 
cut the plant into sections, each with one or more 
buds. 
•  For dividing the whole plant, gently loosen the 
soil around the plant, taking care to not damage 
 
 
the roots, and then lift the plant gently with a 
pitchfork.  Shake off as much soil from the roots 
as possible. 
•  Divide the plant into smaller pieces by hand, 
retaining only healthy, vigorous sections, each 
with new buds.  
•  Replant the divisions as soon as possible.  It is 
important the plants don’t dry out, so if 
replanting is delayed a couple of hours, dip the 
plants briefly in water and keep them in a sealed 
plastic bag in a cool, shady place until you are 
ready to plant them. 
corner of a hoe, mark out shallow drill holes 3-6” 
(8-15 cm) apart, depending on the ultimate size 
of the plant.  Sow seeds thinly and evenly by 
sprinkling or placing them along each drill at the 
appropriate depth.  Carefully cover with soil and 
firm.  Label each row and water gently but 
thoroughly with a fine spray. 
•  The seedlings usually need to be thinned to 
prevent overcrowding.  To minimize disturbance 
•  Cut back the old top-growth and replant the 
divided plant sections to the same depth as 
before. 
•  When replanting, ensure that the roots are well 
spread out in the planting hole and the plant 
firmed in.  Water newly planted divisions 
thoroughly. take care not to expose the roots by 
washing away soil when watering. 
•  Plants should be planted in the full sun in a light, 
loose soil.  Plants should be planted on 12-18” 
centers. 
•  As plants are becoming established, the rooting 
zone needs to be kept moist.  
 
Propagation by seed: When the soil has warmed up 
to at least 45ºF (7ºC) in the spring, sow hardy 
Artemisia species where they are to flowers.  
•  Seeds can also be sown in pots or seed trays and 
either planted out in their final positions in late 
fall or over-wintered in a cold frame to be 
planted in spring.  This technique is particularly 
useful in gardens with clay soil that is slow to 
warm up in spring. 
•  The two main methods of sowing seeds outdoors 
are broadcast and in drills.  For both, prepare the 
seedbed by digging over the soil to one spade 
depth, then rake over and firm. 
•  Broadcast Sowing: Sprinkle seeds thinly and 
evenly on the surface of the prepared seedbed 
and rake them in lightly.  Label the seedbeds, 
then water the area gently but thoroughly with a 
fine spray.

hunting squirrels, rabbits, and various birds 
(Bushnell 1909. Hamel and Chiltoskey 1975. Speck 
1941. Kniffen et al. 1987). Young Cherokee boys 
used giant cane blowguns armed with darts to 
protect ripening cornfields from scavenging birds 
and small mammals (Fogelson 2004). The Choctaw 
used the butt end of a cane, where the outside skin 
was thick, as a knife to cut meat, or as a weapon 
(Swanton 1931). Tribes of Louisiana made flutes, 
duck calls, and whistles out of cane (Kniffen et al. 
1987). Cane is best harvested in the fall or winter 
(October to February) for blow guns and flutes, and 
plant stems, known as culms, are selected from 
mature, hardened off plants with larger diameters.

Uses 
Cultural: Dense stands of cane, known as 
canebrakes, have been likened to a “supermarket” 
offering material for many purposes (Figure 2) 
(Kniffen et al. 1987). Cane provided the Cherokee 
with material for fuel and candles and the coarse, 
hollow stems were made into hair ornaments, game 
sticks, musical instruments, toys, weapons, and tools 
(Hill 1997. Hamel and Chiltoskey 1975). The 
Houma, Koasati, Cherokee, Chitimacha, Chickasaw, 
Choctaw, and Seminole made the stems into arrow 
shafts, blowguns (Figure 3) and darts (Figure 4) for

Young shoots were cooked as a potherb and ripe 
seeds were gathered in the summer or fall and 
ground into flour for food (Morton 1963. Hitchcock 
and Chase 1951). Flint (1828) says of a subspecies 
of giant cane, Arundinaria gigantea ssp. 
macrosperma: “It produces an abundant crop of 
seed with heads like those of broom corn. The seeds 
are farinaceous and are said to be not much inferior 
to wheat, for which the Indians and occasionally the 
first settlers substituted it.” Giant cane also has 
medicinal properties. Both the Houma and the 
Seminole made a decoction of the roots: the Houma 
used it to stimulate the kidneys and renew strength, 
and the Seminole used it as a cathartic (Speck 1941. 
Sturtevant 1955 cited in Moerman 1998). 
 
Cane was important for construction of indigenous 
dwellings, as well as the creation of the mats and 
baskets that formed a large part of household 
furnishings (Galloway and Kidwell 2004). Entire 
canes were used for Choctaw beds, house roofs, and 
walls and they made pallets of whole canes on 
which to spread hides (Swanton 1931). The 
Cherokee constructed dwellings with cane webbing, 
plastered with mud (Hamel and Chiltoskey 1975). 
The Pascagoula and the Biloxi made temples of 
cane as a resting place for their chiefs and the 
Choctaw placed their dead in giant cane hampers 
(Brain et al. 2004. Swanton 1931). Woven mats of 
cane covered ceremonial grounds, seats, floors, and 
walls, and roofs were thatched with it (Hill 1997. 
Swanton 1946). The Natchez made cane mats with 
red and black designs, that were 4 ft. wide and 6 ft. 
long (Swanton 1946). The houses of Seminole 
chiefs were covered with checkered mats of canes 
dyed different colors (Bartram 1996). The Houma, 
Biloxi, Chitimacha, Tunica, and Koasati used cane 
for the making of rafts, bedding, roofing, and floor 
and wall coverings (Kniffen et al. 1987). 
Archeological excavations have revealed that giant 
cane was laid down in criss-crossed layers to mantle 
the sloping sides of the bases of certain mounds 
such as the Great Mound in east central Louisiana 
(Neuman 2006). 
 
 
 
One of the most important uses of giant cane stems 
today and in ancient times is for forming the rich 
natural yellow color in the baskets of the Alabama 
Coushatta, Biloxi-Tunica, Caddo, Cherokee, 
Chitimacha, Choctaw, Creek, Koasati, Seminole and 
other tribes (Figures 5 and 6) (Brain et al. 2004. 
Bushnell 1909. Gettys 1979. Gregory Jr. 2004. 
Hamel and Chiltoskey 1975. Swanton 1942).

Pack, berry, sifting, chafing, winnowing, catch, 
storage, gift, and cooking baskets all carry stems of 
this grass (Duggan and Riggs 1991. Gettys 1979. 
2003). Venison, buffalo meat, pumpkins, hominy 
and boiled beans were presented in serving vessels 
made of giant cane. Choctaw mothers lay their 
children in cradles of cane (Swanton 1946). 
Cherokee fish traps were made of giant cane 
(Leftwich 1970). As non-Indians began to settle in 
the Southeastern United States, weavers from 
various tribes began to trade their baskets with the 
new settlers for items that they needed such as flour, 
coffee, sugar, ribbons, and fabric. Thus, cane 
basketry became part of the exchange-based 
colonial economy (Duggan and Riggs 1991. Lee 
2002. 2006). Matting and basketry technologies that 
use giant cane have been found in archaeological 
sites in Louisiana dating back to at least 2300 B.C. 
(Neuman 2006).

Sarah H. Hill (1997) describes the next step of 
preparation—the thinning of the strands: “…the 
weaver repeatedly inserts the knife under the cane’s 
outer cortex and then pulls the core back as she 
guides the cut with her knife. She works down the 
length of the stick, detaching the interior core until 
only the exterior of the cane remains as a thin, 
pliable split.” After the coarse inner fiber of the cane 
is scraped and discarded, the cane splints are then 
trimmed along each edge to make them of uniform 
width (Leftwich 1970). The materials must be kept 
damp or are re-dampened during the weaving 
process. If not used, the strips are bundled for 
storage (Kniffen et al. 1987). Historically, if stored 
without splitting the culms first, the Choctaw kept 
them in stacks covered an inch or two in water 
(Swanton 1931). 
 
Many kinds of plants were, and continue to be, used 
to dye giant cane black, red, or yellow. The 
Choctaw burned equal parts of the bark of the Texas 
red oak (Quercus texana) and water tupelo (Nyssa 
aquatica) to a fine ash which formed the red color in 
their basketry (Bushnell 1909). The Cherokee dye 
the grass with natural dyes such as black walnut 
(Juglans nigra) root to obtain a black or deep brown 
and bloodroot (Sanguinaria canadensis) to obtain a 
reddish color and these materials formed designs in

Giant cane was broken or cut to its base with a shell 
or bone knife or other lithic devices, and in later 
times other tools such as a sugar cane knife were 
used.  Today pruning shears are frequently 
employed (Neuman 2006. Hill 1997. 2002). The 
Jena Band of Choctaw look for culms at least four 
feet long, of a solid color, and at least five to seven 
years old (Lee 2002). The Eastern Band of Cherokee 
select large canes about the size of the thumb that 
are at least two years old (Leftwich 1970).  
Chitimacha weavers select giant cane with long 
lengths between the joints (Darden et al. 2006. 
NRCS 2002. 2004). 
 
In Choctaw basketry it was customary to collect 
canes in the winter, because they were too brittle in 
the summer (Swanton 1931). Today giant cane is 
harvested in every season, but fall, winter, and early 
spring are the preferred times for many weavers 
because the cane is firm, but not too hard or too soft. 
The cane is cut while still green, and the small 
foliage end is cut off and discarded. The cane is then 
washed in non-chlorinated water, and divided into 
four or eight strips of approximately equal size 
(Figure 7).

baskets (Speck 1920). The Jena Band of Choctaw 
use the berries of elderberry (Sambucus spp.) to dye 
the cane red and the green husks of hickory nuts or 
walnuts to make a black dye. The Chitimacha use 
curly dock (Rumex crispus) and black walnut to dye 
their cane baskets (Kniffen et al. 1987). 
 
Early non-Indian settlers valued the canebrakes as 
natural pastures for their domesticated animals 
(Hughes 1951). According to environmental 
historian Mart Stewart (2007), “Modern studies 
have established that cane foliage was the highest 
yielding native pasture in the South.  It has up to 
eighteen percent crude protein and is rich in 
minerals essential for livestock health.” Livestock 
eagerly eat the young plants, leaves, and seeds and 
stands decline with overgrazing and rooting by hogs 
(Hitchcock and Chase 1951).  
 
Giant cane was sometimes slit and made into chair 
bottoms, weavers’ shuttles, and the hollow stems for 
inexpensive tubes (Porcher 1991). Non-Indian 
settlers also used the giant cane for fishing poles, 
weaving looms, scaffolds for drying cotton, pipe 
stems and pipes, splints for baskets and mats, toys, 
turkey-calls, and musical instruments (Marsh 1977). 
Giant cane is an excellent plant to stabilize stream 
and river banks. The roots and rhizomes link 
together to create an underground mesh that ties the 
soil and plant to the ground. The flexible culms 
bend in high water and resist breakage, but also act 
to seine floating organic matter out of the flood 
waters causing it to drop within the brake. It is being 
included in riparian buffer designs, serving as an 
effective plant for erosion control. Giant cane is also 
proving to be an effective intercept filter of 
sediment, pesticides, and nutrients flowing from 
agricultural watersheds which improves water 
quality (Schoonover et al. 2010). 
 
Wildlife: Canebrakes are an important ecosystem for 
wildlife. Historical accounts along with recent 
surveys identify at least 23 mammal species, 16 bird 
species, four reptile species and seven invertebrates 
that occur within canebrakes (Platt et al. 2001). A 
rare neotropical migrant, the Swainson’s warbler 
(Limnothlypis swainsonii) builds its nests in dense 
cane thickets (Benson et al. 2009. Thomas et al. 
1996). The copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix), 
cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorus), and 
canebrake rattlesnake (Crotalus horridus), an 
endangered species, live and hunt in canebrakes. 
The swamp rabbit (Sylvilagus aquaticus) is 
restricted to canebrakes along the northern border of 
its geographic range. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus 
virginianus) graze on tender cane shoots in early 
spring (Silberhorn 1996).  
 
Six species of butterflies are obligate bamboo 
specialists, including the Creole pearly eye (Enodia 
 
 
creola), southern pearly eye (E. portlandia), 
Southern swamp skipper (Poanes yehl), cobweb 
little skipper (Amblyscirtes aesculapius), cane little 
skipper (A. reversa), and yellow little skipper (A. 
carolina) (Scott 1986 cited in Brantley and Platt 
2001). Canebrakes provide refuge and living 
quarters for black bears (Ursus americanus), 
bobcats (Lynx rufus), and cougars (Puma concolor). 
Squirrels (Sciurus spp.) and wild turkeys (Meleagris 
gallopavo) feed on the seeds of giant cane and 
Carolina parakeets (Conuropsis carolinensis) and 
passenger pigeons (Ectopistes migratorius), both 
now extinct, used to feed on them (Platt and 
Brantley 1997).

Description 
General: A cool-season member of the grass family 
(Poaceae), giant cane comes from the genus 
Arundinaria and is the only bamboo native to the 
United States. It has erect, perennial woody stems or 
culms that are two cm thick that reach up to 10 m 
and a diagnostic character for this genus is the 
presence of culm sheaths at each node of the culm 
(Brantley and Platt 2001. Hitchcock and Chase 
1951. Hughes 1951).   
 
In parts of Alabama, historical accounts report cane 
growing “as high as a man on horse-back could 
reach with an umbrella” (Harper 1928 cited in 
Marsh 1977). The culm leaves are deciduous. 
Foliage leaves are evergreen, eight-15 cm long, and 
strongly cross veined (Clark and Triplett 2007). The 
inflorescence is a raceme or panicle that dies after 
fruiting or sometimes after two consecutive growing 
seasons (Crow and Hellquist 2000. Platt et al. 2004). 
In many populations the plants seldom flower, 
usually only every 10 to 15 years (Silberhorn 1996). 
Giant cane may be monocarpic, meaning that after 
decades of vegetative growth, it flowers once and 
then dies (Gagnon 2009). It has running, horizontal 
rhizomes that are long and slender and sometimes 


Page 5
hollow-centered (Marsh 1977. Clark and Triplett 
2007). 
 
Distribution: The grass occurs from Florida to 
eastern Texas in the south, in parts of the Midwest, 
and north to New York (Figure 8). It is found in at 
least 22 states in the United States (Marsh 1977).

Database. 
 
For current distribution, please consult the Plant 
Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
site. 
Habitat: Giant cane is found from sea level on the 
coastal plain and inland up to 670 m elevation in the 
Appalachian Mountains and on soil types ranging 
from sandy to highly acidic (Farrelly 1984. Platt and 
Brantley 1997). It grows best in loose, well-drained 
alluvium (Marsh 1977). Recent research has 
indicated physiological differences between giant 
cane and switchcane (A. gigantea ssp. tecta) with 
respect to their ability to tolerate flooding. Giant 
cane is adapted to the well-drained soils of the first 
natural levees along a river course, while switchcane 
is tolerant of longer periods of inundation (Mills et 
al. 2011).  
Cane has broad ecologic amplitude and is found in 
the understory of many kinds of habitats including 
loess bluffs, sandy bluff lands, sandy hillsides and 
rock cliffs, loblolly-shortleaf pine forests, upland 
hardwood forests, oak-hickory forests, beech-
magnolia forests, blackgum and white-cedar swamp 
forests, and bottomland hardwood forests (Taylor 
2006. Marsh 1977. Platt and Brantley 1997). It once 
grew luxuriantly throughout the upper country of 
South Carolina and Georgia, but in 1863 Francis 
Porcher, a medical doctor, reported that the plants 
“have been almost entirely consumed by animals” 
(Porcher 1991). It used to extend also in large areas 
in mono-dominant canebrakes in alluvial floodplains 
 
 
along rivers and creeks such as the Arkansas, St. 
Francis, Ozark, Grand, Verdigris, Illinois, Red, 
Wabash, Ocmulgee, Oauchita, Jacks Fork, 
Mississippi, Ohio, Tuckasegee, White, James, and 
Cumberland rivers (Gagnon 2006.2009). Today 
giant cane grows diffusely in the understory of 
forests, in the light of forest gaps, and along rivers 
and creeks, but the vast canebrakes are for the most 
part gone (Gagnon and Platt 2008a). Canebrakes 
have been reduced to less than 2 percent of their 
former area and they are considered a critically 
endangered ecosystem in the Southeastern United 
States (Noss et al. 1995). 
Adaptation 
Canebrakes need some kind of disturbance to 
maintain them (Meanley 1966). Giant cane is fire-
adapted, sprouting rapidly from rhizomes (Taylor 
2006). If only aerial portions are killed by fire or 
broken, new culms arise from the underground part 
of the old culms (Hughes 1951 cited in Marsh 
1977). Canebrake vegetation is adapted to 
anthropogenic disturbance regimes in the form of 
indigenous burning and natural disturbance regimes 
in the form of riverine flooding, lightning fires, 
overstory deadening by roosting flocks of passenger 
pigeons in former times, and windstorms (Brantley 
and Platt 2001). Cane develops well with periodic 
flooding, but does not tolerate permanent saturation 
(Marsh 1977). In the past, fire maintained open 
Arundinaria-Ilex bog areas in the Southeast, keeping 
beech-maple forest from encroaching (Marsh 1977).  
Establishment 
Because giant cane seldom flowers, a source of seed 
is unpredictable. Giant cane also has naturally low 
seed viability and flowering stands can fail to 
produce seeds, limiting the availability of viable 
seeds for seedling production (Neal et al. 2011). 
Attempts to reestablish canebrakes using vegetative 
propagation techniques have had limited success 
(Cirtain 2003). In one study, Gagnon and Platt 
(2008b) found that giant cane seed survival and 
seedling establishment is improved with controlling 
seed-predators and herbivores, and planting seeds 
directly in a layer of leaf litter in moderate shade. 
Seed should be planted on several sites with a range 
of environmental conditions with multiple genetic 
individuals that flower in-phase (Gagnon and Platt 
2008b). Another method is to grow seedlings in a 
greenhouse and outplant them after one year 
(Gagnon and Platt 2008b). Nodal sections of giant 
cane containing an axillary bud can be used as 
explants material.   
 
Giant cane can also be transplanted during the late 
fall to early spring. Recent transplanting work in 
Alabama and Mississippi indicates that winter 
planting (December-March) will give the greatest 
success in establishment (Hamlington et al. 2011). 

Page 6
Plants at least one foot high, and with two feet long 
rhizomes and roots attached, can be dug and 
transplanted into a well-drained, fertile soil, three to 
six inches deep. However, water must be available 
for these transplants. If regular irrigation is not 
available, transplanting must be done in the winter 
months (December through the first weeks of 
March).The soil should have a pH level of 6.8 to 7.2 
and sandy soils and areas that have peat tend to 
produce larger varieties of cane (Oakes 2006).  
 
Giant cane should have at least three to four hours 
of direct sunlight daily. Full sun exposure seems to 
limit top growth, but strongly enhances rhizome and 
root growth, allowing maximum overall growth of 
the canebrake (Neal et al. 2011. Russell et al. 2011). 
If planting giant cane on the grounds surrounding 
the home, keep the plants moist during the first year, 
but not waterlogged. After one year of 
establishment, apply fertilizer that contains nitrogen, 
phosphorous and potassium (NPK), and every other 
year, any type of composted manure (chicken, 
horse, and cow) can be substituted (Oakes 2006). 
Manure can be applied in late fall or early winter 
(Oakes 2006). 
 
Currently researchers are investigating methods of 
vegetative propagation in order to increase the 
supply of plant materials for restoration projects. 
M.C. Mills (2011) found that planting giant cane 
amongst established, clump-forming grasses such as 
big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) and Indiangrass 
(Sorgastrum nutans), may provide some 
environmental facilitation, while reducing direct 
competition because of the differing growth 
strategies.  Paul R. Gagnon (2009) implores 
managers to consider fire-maintained plant 
assemblages within bottomland hardwood forests as 
part of restoration plans.  Dr. Brian Baldwin (2009) 
at Mississippi State University has, in collaboration 
with EPA Region 4, NRCS-AWCC and the 
Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians (MBCI), 
developed propagation techniques and re-
established cane in the Pearl River watershed on 
land belonging to the Mississippi Choctaw (Jolley et 
al. 2009).  
 
Not only the MBCI but also other tribes have put 
much effort into restoring cane stands so that they 
can continue their traditions (Oakes 2006). Cane has 
been re-established on the Chitimacha Reservation 
in Louisiana and at Kituwha, North Carolina with 
the Eastern Band of Cherokee (NRCS 2002. 2004). 
Due to limited access to favorable habitat on tribal 
lands, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians is 
working closely with local conservation groups and 
land managers to preserve and expand existing cane, 
establish new canebrakes, and secure access for 
Cherokee artists (D. Cozzo, pers. comm. 2011).

Management 
Harvesting giant cane judiciously can be good for 
the plant as Sarah H. Hill (1997) explains among the 
Southeastern Cherokee: “Cutting cane also 
stimulated its regeneration by creating openings for 
the spread of new stems. Selective cutting of stalks 
for baskets is an effective way to prune stands.”  
Native Americans burned cane once every seven to 
10 years  (Campbell 1985. Hill 1997. Platt and 
Brantley 1997). Writing about the prairies in south 
central Arkansas, geologist Featherstonhaugh (1844) 
recorded the burning of the cane and high grass by 
the Indians to secure their game. Ecologists have 
concluded that fire will maintain and even expand 
canebrakes if occurring once every 10 years 
(DeVivo 1991. Shepherd et al. 1951, Hughes 1957). 
Fires set in fall, winter, or spring may improve 
conditions for cane and with fire exclusion, cane 
colonies lose vigor and are gradually replaced by 
woody vegetation (Hughes 1957. Platt and Brantley 
1997). Paul R. Gagnon and William J. Platt (2008a) 
hypothesize that multiple disturbances that include 
fire and windstorms or other space-opening 
disturbances promote monotypic-stand formation in 

Page 7
giant cane and fire spurs clonal growth in giant 
cane’s mature phase. 
 
As early as 1913, anthropologist Frank G. Speck 
recorded among the Cherokee weavers in the Great 
Smoky Mountains of western North Carolina that 
the giant cane was getting scarcer (Speck 1920). In 
1979, Libby Jo Devine (1979) completed a Master’s 
Thesis at Georgia State University and she recorded 
that “a [southeastern] basketmaker will have to 
travel 60-100 miles for river cane, as it is becoming 
scarce.” Many of the floodplain forests connected 
with the river systems with canebrakes were 
converted to agricultural lands. Canebrakes also 
diminished with changes in hydrological regimes 
with dams and the creation of recreational 
impoundments, and overgrazing by domestic 
livestock (Brantley and Platt 2001. Thomas et al. 
1996). Many patches of cane have stopped 
producing due to overcrowding of hardwoods and 
pines and thinning the trees 50 to 75 percent will 
allow cane to have less competition for growth and 
increase productivity (Oakes 2006).  
 
Fires, from lightning and Native Americans 
rejuvenated canebrakes, but after European 
settlement these fire regimes were altered, 
sometimes converting giant cane to grasslands or 
open savanna (Brantley and Platt 2001. Wells and 
Whitford 1976 cited in Platt and Brantley 1997). In 
the absence of enriching fire and flood, canebrakes 
reach maturity in about ten years. Stalks then begin 
to decline in vigor and gradually die. In contrast to 
the rapid re-growth that follows disturbance, 
undisturbed regeneration may take as long as several 
decades (Hughes 1966).  
Steven Platt and Christopher Brantley (1997) 
suggest that the best strategy for cane restoration is 
to manage and expand existing cane stands through 
a combination of thinning the overstory, periodic 
burning, and possibly fertilization. Hughes (1957) 
also recommended controlled burning as a means to 
renovating decadent cane stands.

Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and 
area of origin) 
This plant is available from native plant nurseries. 
Also check with your local NRCS Plant Materials 
Center for possible sources of existing plant 
 
 
materials. Research conducted on canebrakes that 
are flowering but not producing seed indicates that 
many canebrakes in some areas are composed of 
only one individual, or two related individuals. 
Giant cane is like people when it comes to 
producing offspring. In order for restoration projects 
using vegetative material or seed to be successful in 
the long term, restoration plants should use a 
mixture of genotypes (cane plants/propagules from 
several locations or watersheds) (Baldwin 2010).

or sweat lodge) with the flowering end toward the 
fire.  The leaves were burned as an incense to cleanse 
and drive away bad spirits, evil influences, bad  
 
dreams, bad thoughts, and sickness.  A small pinch of 
baneberry (Actea rubra) was often mixed with it for 
this purpose.  The smoke was used to purify people, 
spaces, implements, utensils, horses, and rifles in 
various ceremonies.  The Lakota also make bracelets 
for the Sun Dance from white sage (Rogers 1980).  
The Cheyenne use the white sage in their Sun Dance 
and Standing Against Thunder ceremonies (Hart 
1976).  Other tribes who used white sage include the 
Arapaho, Comanche, Gros Ventre, Creek, Navaho, 
Tewa, and Ute (Nickerson 1966, Carlson and Jones 
1939, Hart 1976, Thwaites 1905, Denig 1855, Elmore 
1944, Robbins et al. 1916, Chamberlin 1909). 
 
The Dakota and other tribes used white sage tea for 
stomach troubles and many other ailments (Gilmore 
1977).  The Cheyenne used the crushed leaves as 
snuff for sinus attacks, nosebleeds, and headaches 
(Hart 1976).  The Crow made a salve for use on sores 
by mixing white sage with neck-muscle fat (probably 
from buffalo) (Hart 1976).  They used a strong tea as 
an astringent for eczema and as a deodorant and an 
antiperspirant for underarms and feet.  The Kiowa 
made a bitter drink from white sage, which they used 
to reduce phlegm and to relieve a variety of lung and 
stomach complaints (Vestal and Shultes 1939).  
Usually, they chewed the stem and leaves and 
swallowed the juice. 
 
The Kiowa-Apaches used a thin, sharp-pointed 
section of the stem as a moxa to relieve headaches or 
other pain (Jordan 1965).  The Chinese also use an 
Artemisia species as a moxa to relieve pain such as 
arthritis.  The Kiowa also used an infusion of white 
sage plants for the lungs, to cut phlegm, and for 
stomach trouble.  The Mesquakie used the leaves as a 
poultice to “cure sores of long standing” (Smith 
1928).  They also made a tea of the leaves to treat 
tonsillitis and sore throat and a smudge of the leaves 
to drive away mosquitoes.  The Omaha used the 
leaves in a tea for bathing and used the powdered 
leaves to stop nosebleeds (Gilmore 1913). 
 
Both the Pawnee and the Bannock women drank 
Artemisia ludoviciana tea during their moon time, or 
menstrual periods (Dunbar 1880).  During the time 
that women lived away from their lodges in a 
menstrual hut, they drank the bitter tea made from

The Blackfeet use the white sage in sweat-lodge 
rituals and as an ingredient in a stream vapor inhaled 
for respiratory problems.  The “Giver of Breath” 
heals the ability to breathe with this powerful plant 
medicine.  
 
According to Moerman (1986) Artemisia ludoviciana 
was used for the following: 
•  The Fox used a poultice of leaves to heal old 
sores, a burning smudge to drive away 
mosquitoes and to “smoke ponies when they 
have the distemper”, and an infusion of leaves to 
heal tonsillitis and sore throats.  
•  The Omaha used the leaves as a bath for fevers 
and to prevent nosebleeds. 
•  The Paiute used a decoction of the plant as a 
soaking bath to relieve aching feet, to heal 
stomachaches, as a poultice for rheumatism or 
other aches, as a poultice or compress for 
headaches, to stop diarrhea, in a sweatbath for 
rheumatism, and to relieve the itching and 
discomfort of rashes and skin eruptions. 
•  The Shoshone took white sage for colds, coughs, 
headaches, stomachaches, as a compress for 
fevers, to stop diarrhea, as a physic, as a 
regulator of menstrual disorders, and for 
influenza. 
•  The Washoe used white sage as a cooling, 
aromatic wash for headaches, colds, and coughs. 
 
The lactone glycosides, santonin and artemisin, are 
probably found in all Artemisia species and account 
for their anthelmintic properties (Moore 1979).  
Thujone, a terpene-like ketone and essential oil, is 
also found in the plant and may be responsible for 
some of its medicinal effects (Kinscher 1992).  
However, it is poisonous in large doses.  The Food 
and Drug Administration classifies Artemisia as an 
unsafe herb containing “a volatile oil which is an 
active narcotic poison” (Duke 1985). 
  
Wildlife &amp. Livestock: Sagebrush furnishes essential 
cover for many of the smaller desert animals (Martin 
et al. 1951).  Its foliage and flower clusters constitute 
most of the diet of the sage grouse, and these parts 
together with the twigs bearing them are the primary 
source of food for antelope and mule deer.  Range 
cattle also make good use of sagebrush as forage.  
Other mammals, which browse the foliage and stems, 
include jackrabbits, black-tailed rabbits, white-tailed 
rabbits, cottontails, chipmunks, gophers, ground 
squirrels, and various species of mice, prairie dogs, 
kangaroo rats, and white-throated wood rats.  Elk and 
mountain sheep also browse on the foliage and twigs.

is a white-woolly, perennial herb 3-7 dm (1-2 1/4 ft) 
tall, with a strong odor of sagebrush.  The stems are 
erect and often clustered from creeping rhizomes.  
The leaves are alternate, entire to irregularly toothed 
or lobed, 3-11 cm (1.25-4.5 in) long, up to 1.5 cm 
(9/16 in) wide.  Flower heads are small tight greenish 
clusters among the leaves near the ends of the stems.  
White sage flowers from August through September.  
The fruits are dry, smooth, broadly cylindrical 
achenes.  There are four subspecies of Artemisia 
ludoviciana (Hickman 1993).

Most of the wild sages are abundant in their natural 
habitats.  White sage and other Artemisia species can 
be propagated by seeds, by division of the rootstock, 
or by cuttings taken in the early summer (Kindscher 
1992).

In greenhouse conditions, it is best to dig up and

“quiescent” period that follows seed maturation, 
and leaves are senescent (dried up and brown

•  Split the plant clump into pieces by hand, then 
cut the plant into sections, each with one or more 
buds. 
•  For dividing the whole plant, gently loosen the 
soil around the plant, taking care to not damage 
the roots, and then lift the plant gently with a 
pitchfork. shake off as much soil from the roots 
as possible. 
•  Divide the plant into smaller pieces by hand, 
retaining only healthy, vigorous sections, each 
with new buds.  
•  Replant the divisions as soon as possible.  It is 
important the plants don’t dry out, so if 
replanting is delayed a couple of hours, dip the 
plants briefly in water and keep them in a sealed 
plastic bag in a cool, shady place until you are 
ready to plant them. 
•  Cut back the old top-growth and replant the 
divided plant sections to the same depth as 
before. 
•  When replanting, ensure that the roots are well 
spread out in the planting hole and the plant 
firmed in.  Water newly planted divisions 
thoroughly. take care not to expose the roots by 
washing away soil when watering. 
•  Plants should be planted in the full sun in a light, 
loose soil.  Plants should be planted on 12-18” 
centers. 
•  As plants are becoming established, the rooting 
zone needs to be kept moist.  
 
Propagation by Seed: When the soil has warmed to at 
least 45ºF (7ºC) in the spring, sow hardy Artemisia 
species where they are to flowers.  
•  Seeds can also be sown in pots or seed trays and 
either out-planted in their final positions in late 
fall or over-wintered in a cold frame to be out-
planted in spring.  This technique is particularly 
useful in gardens with clay soil that is slow to 
warm up in spring. 
•  The two main methods of sowing outdoors are 
broadcast and drills.  For both, prepare the 
seedbed first by digging over the soil to one 
spade depth, then rake over and firm. 
•  Broadcast Sowing: Sprinkle seeds thinly and 
evenly on the surface of the prepared seedbed 
and rake them in lightly.  Label the seedbeds, 
then water the area gently but thoroughly with a 
fine spray. 
•  Sowing in drills: Use either a trowel tip or the 
corner of a hoe, mark out shallow drill holes 3-6” 
(8-15 cm) apart, depending on the ultimate size 
of the plant.  Sow seeds thinly and evenly by 
sprinkling or placing them along each drill at the 
appropriate depth.  Carefully cover with soil and 
 
 
pack firmly.  Label each row and water gently 
but thoroughly with a fine spray. 
•  To prevent overcrowding, the seedlings usually 
need to be thinned. to minimize disturbance to a 
seedling being retained, press the soil around it 
after thinning the adjacent seedlings. 
•  Water the newly establishing seedlings fairly 
frequently until the roots have developed.

Water was poured into another watertight basket in 
which rocks, heated in the coals of a fire, were added.  
The rocks were constantly stirred to keep the basket 
from burning.  The heated water was then poured 
over the meal until the entire flavor was extracted 
from the berries.   
 
Berries were strung to make necklaces, and leaves 
and berries were used as decorations (Moerman 
1998).  The berries were also used as bait to catch 
steelhead.   
 
The Miwok and the Cahuilla chewed the leaves to 
treat cramps and stomachaches (Barrett &amp. Gifford 
1933. Bean &amp. Saubel 1972).  Many tribes used an 
infusion of madrone bark to treat sores on the skin.  
The Pomo made a tannic tea from the bark that was 
used to wash sores, but not poison oak (Goodrich et 
al. 1980).  However, it is probable that the Salinan 
taught the Padres at Mission San Antonio de Padua 
how to use the berries and leaves of Pacific madrone 
and the related manzanita to make a wash used for 
treating poison oak (Heinsen 1972).  Bark tea was 
drunk to treat colds and sore throats.  Pomo women 
used an infusion of the bark as an astringent beauty 
wash to close the pores and soften the skin on their 
faces.   
 
Wildlife: Pacific madrone trees provide edible berries 
and habitat for many bird species including robins, 
cedar waxwings and bandtailed pigeons, varied 
thrush, and quail.  The trees provide perches and 
nesting places for many bird species.  Cavity nesting 
birds that utilize Pacific madrone are red-breasted 
sapsuckers, woodpeckers, downy woodpeckers, 
mountain chickadees, house wrens, and western 
bluebirds (McMurray 1989).  Mule deer, raccoons, 
ringtails, and bears eat the berries.  Mule deer do not 
generally browse on mature leaves except during 
times of scarcity of other foliage.  However, after fire 
the plants will sprout up with new shoots that are 
eaten by mule deer as well as domestic sheep, goats, 
and cattle.  The flowers attract bees.   
 
Erosion control: Pacific madrone can prevent erosion 
in sites that experience frequent disturbance.  The 
plants have a widely spreading root system and they 
quickly reestablish after disturbance by re-sprouting 
from the stump or underground burl (McMurray 
1989).

of the foods of the Salinan.  The Salinan, Miwok, 
Pomo, and other California tribes have long used the 
berries of Pacific madrone for food and to make 
cider.  Berries within reach were hand picked and 
placed into baskets.  The higher branches were 
shaken or hit with a long stick to knock off the 
berries into a basket held below or onto a cleared area 
of ground beneath the tree.  The gathered berries 
were eaten fresh, made into cider, or cooked and 
dried for later use.  Fresh berries were eaten in small 
quantities (Bocek 1984) probably because the high 
tannin content makes them astringent.  The Miwok 
chewed the fresh or dried berries for flavor but did 
not swallow them (Barrett &amp. Gifford 1933. Moerman 
1998).  Most often, the berries were used to make 
unfermented cider.  The berries were first pounded 
into a course meal.  The meal was placed into a 
straining basket, which was placed over another 
basket that was so tightly woven it could hold water.

Other: The dense, fine-grained, wood is heavy and 
brittle.  It has been used for flooring and cabinets but 
is generally unsuitable for use in construction 
because it does not dry uniformly and can crack and 
split.  Pacific madrone does make a beautiful veneer 
and is used for pulp and firewood.  Charcoal made 
from madrone wood has been used in the past as a 
component in gunpowder (Parsons 1966).  The bark 
was sometimes used for tanning leather.

General: Heath family (Ericaceae).  Pacific madrone 
is an evergreen tree that is native to the northwestern 
Coast Ranges of North America.  The trees have 
single or multiple trunks with rounded, spreading 
crowns.  Mature trees reach heights of 6m to 30m or 
more depending on environmental conditions.  The 
alternately arranged leaves are oval, (7 to 15 cm 
long), thick, and have finely serrated margins.  The 
leaf surfaces are glossy dark green above with lighter 
grayish green beneath.  Leaves remain on the plant 
for two years before they are shed.  The striking 
cinnamon red bark is thin and smooth.  The bark on 
young branches peels in large papery flakes to reveal 
an attractive, satiny green surface beneath that 
darkens with time to deep red.  In midsummer, the 
exfoliated bark, along with shed leaves in shades of 
red to orange, form a lovely colorful carpet beneath 
the tree canopy (Saunders 1923).  Fragrant bell-
shaped flowers appear in large, showy clusters at the 
ends of the branches during the spring, from March 
through May, but sometimes as early as January.  The 
flowers (8mm) are yellowish-white to pink and 
consist of 5 fused petals.  The fruits are loose clusters 
of bumpy, scarlet red berries (8 to 12mm) that 
contain a mealy pulp and about 20 hard seeds.  The 
genus was named from the Celtic word “arboise,” 
which means rough fruit (Young &amp. Young 1992).  
The early Spanish Californians named the tree 
“madroño” after the strawberry tree (Arbutus unido), 
which grows in Spain and other nearby 
Mediterranean countries (Parsons 1966).  The edible 
fruits ripen from the early fall until December or 
January.   
 
Distribution: Pacific madrone is native to the West 
Coast of North America and occurs from the 
Southern Coast Ranges of California to British 
Columbia in the north from 100 to 1500 m.  
Occasional populations are found in the Sierra 
 
 
Nevada Range at middle elevations.  For current 
distribution, please consult the Plant Profile page for 
this species on the PLANTS Web site.   
 
Habitat: Pacific madrone is found on wooded slopes 
and canyons in oak, redwood, and mixed evergreen 
forests as well as in chaparral communities.  The 
trees are commonly associated with other species and 
rarely occur in pure stands.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='The Pacific madrone is a spectacular tree.  Its showy 
bark, flowers and berries along with the gracefully 
crooked branches inspired Bret Harte to compose a 
poem about its loveliness (see Parsons 1966).  But, 
alas, they can be difficult to grow.  These trees 
should only be planted in very well drained soils in 
areas with non-alkaline water.  Although generally 
started from seed, Pacific madrone may also be 
propagated from cuttings, grafting, or layers.   
 
To start from seed, gather the fruits from the trees 
when they are ripe—generally from October to 
December.  Soften the berries by soaking them in 
water and then separate the seeds from the pulp.  
Completely dry the seeds before storing.  Dried seeds 
may be stored for up to 2 years at room temperature.  
For best germination, use seeds that have been 
stratified by pre-chilling for one to two months at 2 to 
5 degrees C.  Plant the seeds, in either spring or fall, 
in containers that have been filled with a mix of peat, 
sand, and gravel.  Allow the seedlings to reach at 
least two feet in height before transplanting.  
Established trees can live up to 200 years or more 
and do not transplant well, so select a site where the 
tree can remain permanently.  Choose a place with 
full sun to partial shade well away from lawns and 
other plants that require summer watering.  Deeply 
irrigate the seedlings once a month during the 
summer months until established.  Do not splash 
water upon the trunk or leaves while watering, as the 
trees are susceptible to fungus that resides in the soil.  
Once established, the trees will require only 
infrequent, deep irrigation during unusually dry 
summers.  The trees develop an underground, woody 
organ called a ‘burl’ that re-sprouts if the stem is 
destroyed.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='In areas managed for conifer timber production, 
Pacific madrone has been considered a “weedy” tree 
species.  This is because it can out-compete 
replanting of timber species because of its ability to 
resprout from its stump or burl after disturbance.  
Interestingly, there is some evidence that Pacific 
madrone can facilitate growth of Douglas fir at some 
sites (McMurray 1989).   
 
In natural areas, the situation is reversed from that of 
timber production areas.  Pacific madrone depends on 
periodic fire to reduce the shading resulting from the 
closing conifer overstay.  Fire suppression causes 
Pacific madrone to be out-competed by species that 
can better tolerate shade.  Currently Pacific madrone 
is declining in many of these areas due to infrequent 
fires and other factors including drought, insects, and 
pathogens.

madrone is also affected by “sudden oak death” 
caused by the introduced fungus, Phytophthora.   
To keep trees healthy, apply a thick layer of mulch to 
the root zone area beneath the crown and do not 
garden or compact this area in any way, avoid 
frequent irrigation, prune only from June to 
September (when the fungus and insects are less 
active), and fertilize if the tree shows signs of

Wildlife 
Manzanita not only provides habitat to many Pacific 
animals, but supplies food to them as well. It has thick 
foliage (shrubbery) that offers many animals cover from 
predation. Small mammals, song birds and game birds eat 
and enjoy the fruits all throughout the summer (Kauffman 
and Martin, 1991. Martin, 1951) (Table 1). Then through 
fecal deposition the animals disperse A. viscida seeds 
(Kauffman and Martin, 1991). Deer frequently forage on 
the twigs and leaves (Martin et al., 1951) (Table 1).

seven are native to California.  Manzanita has beautiful 
red bark and, like the conifer, holds its leaves year round 
(Stuart and Sawyer, 2001). Different manzanita species 
often hybridize with each other because the distribution of 
species tends to be local, so identification down to species 
is difficult when habitats overlap (Ferris, 1968. Hickman, 
1993. Stuart and Sawyer, 2001). 
 
Sticky whiteleaf manzanita is an erect, tree-like shrub 
growing from 3 to 12 feet in height. The stems and twigs 
can be smooth and hairless, have short stiff hairs or have 
glands or gland-like structures on them. The leaves stand 
upright and have an ovate to round shape and can be 
classified as evergreen (Figure 1). The surface of the leaf 
can be smooth and hairless or have stiff hairs, glands and 
rounded nipple-like bumps called papilla. 
 
The flowering part of the plant (inflorescence) is panicle-
like (Hickman, 1993. Howard, 1992. McMinn, 1939. 
Tucker, 2009). The flowers on manzanita are round and 
often referred to as “urn or bell shaped” with five lobes 
and are pinkish white. The flowering period is from 
February to April (Howard, 1992. Keator, 1994. McMinn, 
1939). The fruits resemble tiny apples (the Spanish name 
for apple is manzana) which are sticky and are available  
early to late summer through early fall (Keator, 1994. 
Stuart and Sawyer, 2001). 
 
Ethnobotany 
Ethnobotanical: Sticky whiteleaf manzanita is a highly 
beneficial plant native to California, the berries of sticky 
whiteleaf manzanita were highly valued by the Maidu, 
Miwok, Wintu and possibly other tribes for eating and the 
making of a delicious cider (Merriam 1967). In making 
cider, the Miwok tribe would crush the berries (pai) with 
a grinding tool. Water was then poured over the crushed 
berries, collecting the entire flavor as it passed through 
(we can compare this process to making coffee)  (Figure 
2).  
 
 
Figure 2: Making manzanita cider. Crushed manzanita berries are in 
the top winnowing basket and water is poured over the berries and 
caught in a water-tight basket below. Photograph courtesy of Yosemite 
National Park. 
If any of the berries passed through, the liquid would be 
decanted (Barrett and Gifford, 1933. Du Bois, 1935). The 
Indians at Chowchilla filtered manzanita cider using deep 
round openwork bowl baskets (Merriam, 1955). The 
beverage would keep without souring for up to four days. 
The cider was sweet and always drank before 
fermentation because fermentation would make it sour 
(Barrett and Gifford, 1933. Du Bois, 1935). 
Anthropologist Cora Du bois (1935:20) describes the 
processing and cooking of the berries among the Wintu: 
”Berries pounded into coarse flour, dampened, next 
morning dried and parched with hot rocks. Winnowed. 
Fine flour boiled with water and made into sweetish 
soup.” 
 
Tribes known to have eaten the berries raw and also dried 
and stored for winter include the Wintu (Harrington, 
1984. Knudtson, 1977). However, tribes in the Yosemite 
region chewed the berries for flavor, but did not swallow 
them (Barrett and Gifford, 1933). The Maidu pounded the 
berries in mortars and ate them without other treatment 
(Merriam 1967). 
 
The berries were collected from the manzanita bush by 
hand picking into burden baskets that were hung around 
the neck or by using flat sifting baskets placed underneath 
the shrub. The branches would then be shaken and the 
berries would collect into the baskets (Barrett and 
Gifford, 1933. Dubois, 1935).   
 
Sticky whiteleaf manzanita was also used medicinally 
among Native American tribes. The Wintu tribes used the 
leaves in tea to alleviate diarrhea and they soaked the 
leaves to relieve poison oak symptoms (Knutdson, 1977). 
The Miwok tribes chewed the leaves to help ease pain 
associated with cramps and stomachaches (Barrett and 
Gifford, 1933).  
 
Indigenous stewardship methods traditionally used for 
management of this plant were frequent cool temperature 
prescribed burns.  
Distribution:  Sticky whiteleaf manzanita ranges from the 
Sierra Nevada foothills to the North Coast Ranges, 
Klamath Ranges and Siskiyou Mountains at elevations of 
152 to 1,524 meters. It is “most commonly found in the 
Sierra Nevada foothills from Shasta County to Amador 
County” (McMinn, 1939). For current distribution, please 
consult the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Website. 
 
Habitat:  Manzanita can be found in chaparral, yellow-

Adaptation 
 
 

Page 3
Sticky whiteleaf manzanita is shade intolerant, and 
therefore, often becomes the dominant or co-dominant 
plant in the landscape (Howard, 1992). 
Establishment 
A hot and forceful fire will wipe out all sticky whiteleaf 
manzanita, but will also stimulate dormant seeds in the 
soil (Howard, 1992. Hughes et al., 1987).  Seeds will 
germinate the first growing season after the fire (Howard, 
1992). This plant will become dominant in the landscape 
three to four years after a fire (Hughes et al., 1987).  
Sticky whiteleaf manzanita stands will then reach sexual 
maturity a decade after the original fire (Detling, 1961). 
Management 
To avoid severe wildfires, it is recommended to do 
prescribed burns in these communities (Green, 1977). 
Sticky whiteleaf manzanita fuels fire by consistently 
shredding bark and having branches that die off during 
drought years (Minore, 1988). The leaves and twigs 
provide optimal air circulation because of their “surface-
to-volume” ratio which helps the plant completely burn 
and intensifies the fire (Green, 1977). Furthermore, 
terpenes and flammable oils are found in the leaves and 
twigs (Philpot, 1969). In areas where fire is suppressed, 
unusually high amounts of debris from sticky whiteleaf 
manzanita will be left on the ground.  
Pests and Potential Problems 
Swiecki at el. (2003) found root and crown rot when A. 
viscida  habitat overlapped with Ione manzanita 
(Arctostaphylos myrtifolia) on Ione Formation soil. The 
pathogen was identified as Phytophthora cinnamomi. 
However, this pathogen has not been reported as causing 
significant damage to native California stands. 
Environmental Concerns 
There are no known environmental concerns associated 
with sticky whiteleaf manzanita.  
Seeds and Plant Production 
Collect seeds in August through October (Kaufmann, 
1991) in a small paper or cloth bag. Seeds should be 
completely dried and then stored in a cool, dry room with 
proper air circulation until propagation.  
 
Seed propagation can be challenging because of the thick 
coat around the seed (Hart, 2005). The seeds require at 
least two months to germinate (Emery, 1988).Seeds have 
to be scarified before germination either with fire or acid 
(Stuart and Sawyer, 2001). For example, seeds can be 
treated with dilute sulphuric acid for two to four hours.  
Seeds and acid should be put in a glass container and 
stirred periodically with a glass rod.  After scarification, 
seeds should be sown in a medium and placed outside. To 
scarify with fire, spread seeds in a damp medium, then 
place a layer of pine needles or excelsior on top to ensure 
the fire becomes hot enough. After the fire, water the 
seeds thoroughly and leave the container outside (caution: 
never use plastic containers when treating with fire).  
 
 
For vegetative propagation, cut the semi-mature previous 
season’s growth between December and January.  “Treat 
with a hormone solution for 10 seconds. Place in medium 
that is 1 peat: 10 perlite rooting mix” (Hart, 2005). Place 
in a shaded area outside, mist and water as necessary.  
After roots have established, place in a medium of  “1 
sand: 7 peat: 7 perlite.”   Whiteleaf manzanita requires 
proper drainage and aeration in the soil.

Propagation by division: Divide mature plants in 
early autumn when they start to go dormant.  With 
the appropriate garden tool, cut through the rhizome 
at intervals of 6-8 inches.  Another method is to leave 
the parent plant in place and divide sections from the 
edges of the clump.  Replant the new divisions right 
away and water them thoroughly.

Apocynum cannabinum.  The bark is removed and the 
fibers released by first rubbing between the hands 
and then drawing the fibers over a stock.  Twisting 
the fiber opposite each other and twining them 
together formed the cord. often this was 
accomplished by rolling the fibers on the thigh while 
twisting them together. 
 
Wildlife: Milkweed species are attractive to 
butterflies, bees, and other insects.  Accordingly, this 
is a wonderful horticultural plant for beautiful floral 
landscaping that attracts butterflies (particularly 
Monarchs) and other insects. 
 
Toxicity: The sap contains a lethal brew of 
cardenolides (heart poison), which produces vomiting 
in low doses and death in higher doses.  Chemicals 
from the milkweed plant make the monarch 
caterpillar s flesh distasteful to most animals.  At one 
time milkweed was classified as a noxious weed due 
to reported toxic effects on livestock, and efforts 
were made to eradicate.  Milkweeds are thought to be 
poisonous to cows and sheep.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Seed Collection: Collect seeds after pods have 
ripened, but before they have split open.  The seeds 
are wind dispersed, so be careful when gathering to 
place in a paper or burlap bag to avoid losing them.  
 
Seeds can be directly sewn into the ground in the fall.  
The seed is very viable.  Planting seed the first fall 
after collecting seeds maximizes revegetation 
success.  It is not certain how long you can store the 
seeds.  Cold treatment for three months improves 
seed germination in some milkweed species from 
higher elevations or colder climates (where it freezes 
in the winter).  
 
Revegetation successes with milkweeds seem to be 
improved by planting seeds directly in the ground.  
High mortality seems to occur with plants in pots and 
Asclepias species don t over-winter well in pots.  
Once young plants are potted, they often don t re-
emerge in the spring.  Milkweed plants naturally die 
back in winter, but will re-sprout during the next 
growing season.  However, those planted in pots will 
not resprout. 
 
Whole Plant Collections: For milkweed species with 
rhizomes, propagation by cuttings of the tuberous 
rhizome is also easy and reliable.  The cuttings 
should be made when the plant is dormant.  Each 
piece of the rhizome should have at least one bud 
(they are about two inches apart).  Timing of 
propagation is important.  Harvest or divide plants 
and move them in October at the beginning of the 
rainy season.  Get the plants in the ground by late fall 
so they can develop enough root growth to survive 
the winter.  Irrigation the first year will improve 
survival, and by the second year the root system 
should be well enough established so plants will 
survive on their own. 
 
Both seedlings and cuttings will usually bloom in 
their second year, although cuttings will occasionally 
bloom during their first year (Kindscher 1992).

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='When used for fiber, milkweed is collected in the 
autumn after the leaves have begun to senesce or dry 
up.  Plants grow in places that have been disturbed 
such as road grading and construction sites, logging 
landing fills, etc.  Pete Bunting (per comm 2-9-1999)  
says, &quot.In the fall when the milkweed has dried I 
 
 
check to see if they will break off at the ground line.  
The plants are usually a yellow tan to gray depending 
on how long they have dried.  I like the gray for 
softer string but the fibers are shorter.  The tan stalks 
have longer fibers but are also stiff and hard to work 
but very long.  I break off as many of the plants as I 
can gather as they are going to re-sprout in the spring.  
I try and let them dry some more.  Then I process 
them.  I have used plants that have over-wintered 
under snow and they were fine but had soft, short 
fiber.  After 2 winters they are usually no good but 
you have another year s stalks to pick by then.&quot.  The 
dried stalks are then split open and the fibers are 
twisted into string. 
 
Vast quantities of fiber plants are required for the 
making of nets, regalia, and cordage by California 
Indians.  Blackburn and Anderson (1993) quote Craig 
Bates of the Yosemite Museum that it takes 
approximately five stalks of milkweed or Indian 
hemp to manufacture one foot of cordage.  A Sierra 
Miwok feather skirt or cape contain about 100 feet of 
cordage made from approximately 500 plant stalks, 
while a deer net 40 feet in length (Barrett and Gifford 
1933:178) contained some 7,000 feet of cordage, 
which would have required the harvesting of a 
staggering 35,000 plant stalks. 
 
Both milkweed and dogbane were burned in the fall 
by California Indian tribes to eliminate dead stalks 
and stimulate new growth.  Burning causes new 
growth to have taller, straighter stems (with longer 
fibers).  It also stimulates flower and seed production.

Zuni people utilize the silky seed fibers, which are 
spun on a hand-held wooden spindle, made into yarn, 
and woven into fabric (especially for dancers).  
Pueblo people eat green milkweed pods and 
uncooked roots from one of the species that forms 
fleshy tubers underground. 
 
Milkweeds supply tough fibers for making cords and 
ropes, and for weaving a coarse cloth. Milkweeds 
stems are collected after the stalks dry in late fall to 
early winter.  The dried stalks are split open to 
release the fibers.  Milkweed fibers are sometimes 
mixed with fibers of Indian hemp, Apocynum 
cannabinum. 
 
The Yokia Indians of Mendocino County, California, 
ate the young blossoms of Asclepias fascicularis raw 
but not in large amounts (Balls 1962).  The most 
common use for these plants, recorded among almost 
all the tribes throughout California, was to obtain a 
kind of chewing gum from the sap of Asclepias 
fascicularis and other milkweed species.  The sticky 
white sap was heated slightly until it became solid, 
then added to salmon fat or deer grease. 
 
Wildlife: Milkweed species are attractive to 
butterflies, bees, and other insects.  Accordingly, this 
is a wonderful horticultural plant for beautiful floral 
landscaping that attracts butterflies (particularly 
Monarchs) and other insects.  Monarch butterflies are 
specific to milkweed plants.  This is the only type of 
plant on which the eggs are laid and the larvae will 
feed and mature into a chrysalis.  Eggs are laid on the 
underside of young healthy leaves.  It is important to 
have large clumps of milkweeds for the young 
caterpillars. their response to predation is to drop to 
the ground and &quot.play possum.&quot.  They cannot find 
their way back to the milkweed stems, which they 
need to survive, unless they are fairly densely spaced. 
 
Monarch, Queen and Viceroy butterflies are 
Müllerian mimics. all are toxic, and have co-evolved 
similar warning patterns to avoid predation.  Other 
insects, which utilize milkweed, are the large 
milkweed bug, common milkweed bug, red 
milkweed beetle, blue milkweed beetle, and bees. 
 
Toxicity: Milkweed sap contains a lethal brew of 
cardenolides (heart poison), which produces vomiting 
in low doses and death in higher doses.  Chemicals 
from the milkweed plant make the monarch 



Page 2
caterpillar s flesh distasteful to most animals.  At one 
time, milkweed was classified as a noxious weed due 
to reported toxic effects on livestock, and efforts 
were made to eradicate it.  Milkweeds are thought to 
be poisonous to cows and sheep.

Asclepias flowers look like crowns, with the corolla 
reflexed and hoods elevated above the corolla.  In 
narrow-leaf milkweed, the corolla is reflexed, 
greenish white, sometimes tinged purple. The hoods 
are also greenish white.  The horns are longer than 
the hoods.  Narrow-leaf milkweed is a glabrous 
perennial with glabrous to ascending stems.  Leaves 
are in whorls of 3-5, often with axillary clusters of 
small leaves.  The leaf blades are narrowly lanceolate 
with a tapered base.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Distribution='For current distribution, please consult the Plant 
Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
site.  Milkweed grows in clumps beside roadways 
and on abandoned farmlands and other open areas, 
reaching heights of 120 to 150 cm (4 to 5 ft) during 
the summer.  Milkweed species grow throughout the 
United States.  Narrow-leaf milkweed occurs on dry 
ground and sunny spots in valleys and foothills at 
elevations from 50 to 220 m.  The range extends 
through California to Washington, Utah and Baja 
California.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Seed Collection: Collect seeds after pods have 
ripened, but before they have split open. The seeds 
are wind dispersed, so be careful when gathering to 
place in a paper or burlap bag to avoid losing them.  
 
Seeds can be directly sewn into the ground in the fall.  
The seed is very viable.  Planting seed the first fall 
after collecting seeds maximizes revegetation 
success.  It is not certain how long you can store the 
seeds.  Cold treatment for three months improves 
seed germination in some milkweed species from 
higher elevations or colder climates (where it freezes 
in the winter).  
 
Revegetation success with milkweed seems to be 
improved by planting seeds directly in the ground.  
High mortality seems to occur with plants in pots. 
Asclepias species don t over-winter well in pots.  
 
 
 
Once young plants are potted, they often don t re-
emerge in the spring. Milkweed plants naturally die 
back in winter.  If you plant them in a pot, they don t 
come back the next year. If you plant in the ground, 
they do. 
 
Whole Plant Collection: For milkweed species with 
rhizomes, propagation by cuttings of the tuberous 
rhizome is also easy and reliable.  The cuttings 
should be made when the plant is dormant.  Each 
piece of the rhizome should have at least one bud 
(they are about two inches apart).  
 
Timing of propagation is important.  Harvest or 
divide plants and move them in October at the 
beginning of the rainy season.  Get the plants in the 
ground by late fall so they can develop enough root 
growth to survive the winter.  Irrigation the first year 
will improve survival, and by the second year the 
root system should be well enough established so 
plants will survive on their own.  
 
Both seedlings and cuttings will usually bloom in 
their second year, although cuttings will occasionally 
bloom during their first year (Kindscher 1992).

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='When used for fiber, milkweed is collected in the 
autumn after the leaves have begun to senesce or dry 
up.  Plants generally grow in places that have been 
disturbed, such as road grading and construction 
sites, logging landing fills, etc. Pete Bunting (pers. 
comm. 2-9-1999) says, &quot.In the fall when the 
milkweed has dried, I check to see if they will break 
off at the ground line.  The plants are usually a 
yellow tan to gray depending on how long they have 
dried.  I like the gray for softer string but the fibers 
are shorter.  The tan stalks have longer fibers but are 
also stiff and hard to work but very long.  I break off 
many of the plants as I can gather as they are going to 
re-sprout in the spring.  I try and let them dry some 
more.  Then I process them.  I have used plants that 
have over-wintered under snow and they were fine 
but had soft, short fiber.  After 2 winters they are 
usually no good but you have another year s stalks to 
pick by then.&quot.  The dried stalks are then split open 
and the fibers are twisted into string. 
 
Vast quantities of fiber plants are required for the 
making of nets, regalia, and cordage by California 
Indians.  Blackburn and Anderson (1993) quote Craig 
Bates of the Yosemite Museum that it takes 
approximately five stalks of milkweed or Indian 
hemp to manufacture one foot of cordage.  A Sierra 
Miwok feather skirt or cape contain about 100 feet of 
cordage made from approximately 500 plant stalks, 

Page 3
while a deer net 40 feet in length (Barrett and Gifford 
1933:178) contained some 7,000 feet of cordage, 
which would have required the harvesting of 35,000 
plant stalks. 
 
Both milkweed and dogbane were burned in the fall 
by California Indian tribes to eliminate dead stalks 
and stimulate new growth.  Burning causes new 
growth to have taller, straighter stems (with longer 
fibers).  It also stimulates flower and seed production.

Twisting the fiber opposite each other and twining 
them together forms the cord.  Often this is 
accomplished by rolling the fibers on the thigh while 
twisting them together. 
 
The young shoots, stems, flower buds, immature 
fruits, and roots of butterfly milkweed were boiled 
and eaten as a vegetable by various indigenous 
groups of eastern and mid-western America.  The 
Meskwaki steam the flower buds as a food source. 
they are nutritious but not considered very flavorful.  
 
The Cherokee drank an infusion of common 
milkweed root and virgin’s bower (Clematis species) 
for backaches (Moerman 1986).  The Cherokee, 
Iroquois, and Rappahannock used the sap to remove 
warts, for ringworm, and for bee stings.  The 
Cherokee used the plant as a laxative, an antidote for 
gravel and dropsy, and an infusion was given for 
mastitis.  The Cherokee took an infusion of the root 
for venereal diseases.  The Chippewa made a cold 
decoction of common milkweed root and added it to 
food to produce postpartum milk flow.  The Iroquois 
took an infusion of milkweed leaves for stomach 
medicine.  A compound decoction of plants was 
taken to prevent hemorrhage after childbirth by the 
Iroquois.  The Menominee ate the buds or a 
decoction of the root for chest discomfort.  The 
Ojibwa used the root as a female remedy.  The 
Potawatomi used the root for unspecified ailments.  
 
Common milkweed was used by the Meskwaki as a 
contraceptive (Kindscher 1992, Erichsen-Brown 
1979, De Laszlo and Henshaw 1954).  A Mohawk 
anti-fertility concoction was prepared by boiling a 
fistful of dried, pulverized milkweed and three jack-
in-the-pulpit rhizomes in a pint of water for 20 
minutes.  The infusion was drunk at the rate of one 
cup an hour to induce temporary sterility (Kindscher 
1992). 
 
Milkweed species as a group are known to contain 
cardiac glycosides that are poisonous to humans and 
livestock, as well as other substances that may 
account for their medicinal effect.  Resinoids, 
glycosides, and a small amount of alkaloids are 
present in all parts of the plant.  Symptoms of 
poisoning by the cardiac glycosides include dullness, 
weakness, bloating, inability to stand or walk, high 
body temperature, rapid and weak pulse, difficulty 
breathing, dilated pupils, spasms, and coma.

Wildlife: The cardiac glycoside in milkweed has also 
been useful as a chemical defense for monarch 
butterflies (Danaus plexippus).  Chemicals from the 
milkweed plant make the monarch caterpillar s flesh 
distasteful to most predators.  Monarch butterflies are 
specific to milkweed plants. this is the only type of

attractive to many insect species, including the large 
milkweed bug, common milkweed bug, red 
milkweed beetle, blue milkweed beetle, and bees.  
Accordingly, this is a wonderful horticultural plant 
for landscaping to attract butterflies (particularly 
monarchs), whose numbers are declining and 
migratory routes changing due to lack of appropriate 
habitat.

Common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) is a perennial 
herb growing from a deep rhizome. The hairy stems 
are usually solitary from a simple to branched and 
thickened base, and are 6-20 dm (1.9-6.5 ft) tall.  The 
opposite leaves have broadly ovate to elliptic blades 
that are 10-20 cm (3.9-7.9 in) long and 5-11 cm (1.9-
4.3 in) wide.  The leaves are sparsely hairy above and 
densely hairy below, and the petiole is 0.2-1.4 cm 
(0.08-0.77 in) long.  The inflorescence occurs in the 
upper leaf axils, and there are 20-130 flowers per 
inflorescence.  The flowers are small, 11-17 mm (0.4-
0.7 in), and bloom from May to August.  The five 
petals are green to purple-tinged, and are topped by a 
crown of five erect lobes that are rose to purple, 
rarely white.  The fruits are spindle-shaped follicles 
covered with soft hairs.  The small, round, hairy 
seeds are 6-8 mm (0.2-0.3 in) in diameter. 
 
Distribution: For current distribution, please consult 
the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site.  This plant grows throughout the 
Great Plains ecoregion from southern Canada south 
to NE Oklahoma, NW Georgia, and Texas, and east 
from North Carolina to Maine.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Adaptation: Common milkweed grows in sandy, 
clayey, or rocky calcareous soils.  It occurs along the 
 
 
banks or flood plains of lakes, ponds, and waterways, 
in prairies, forest margins, roadsides, and waste 
places. This species hybridizes with showy milkweed 
(Asclepias speciosa). 
 
Common milkweed is easily propagated by both seed 
and rhizome cuttings.  Both seedlings and cuttings 
will usually bloom in their second year, although 
cuttings will occasionally bloom during their first 
year.  Seeds and plants are available from many 
nurseries.  Common milkweed increases by 
underground shoots and can be invasive.  It is ideal in 
semi-dry places where it can spread without 
presenting problems for other ornamental species. 
 
Propagation from Cuttings: Propagation by cuttings 
of the tuberous rhizome is easy and reliable.  The 
cuttings should be made when the plant is dormant.  
Each piece of the rhizome should have at least one

1) Collect seeds after the pods have ripened, but 
before they have split open.  The seeds are wind 
dispersed, so be careful when gathering to place in a 
paper or burlap bag to avoid losing them.  
2) Eliminate weeds before planting.  Strip off any 
sod. Cultivate the soil to a fine tilth, firm the soil by 
treading or rolling, and rake lightly. 
3) Seeds can be directly sewn into the ground in the 
fall.  Sow the seed mixture (with fine sand for even 
distribution) at a rate of 1/8 oz per sq. yd (4 g per sq. 
meter) or as advised. 
4) If planting in flats or in a greenhouse, common 
milkweed seeds should be cold-treated for three 
months.  
5) The seed is very viable.  It is not certain how long 
you can store the seeds and maintain their viability.  
6) During the first summer, weed invasive plants and 
water as needed.

When used for fiber, milkweed is collected in the 
autumn after the leaves have begun to fall off, the 
stalks turn gray or tan, and the plant dries up.  If the 
milkweed stems will break off at the ground it s time 
to harvest.  Breaking off as many stalks as possible 
encourages resprouting in the spring.  The dried 
stalks are then split open and the fibers are twisted 
into string.  Vast quantities of fiber plants are 
required for nets, regalia, and cordage.

cultivated the pawpaw for fruit and are responsible 
for its widespread range today.  The Cherokee and 
many other tribes used the pawpaw fruit for food.  
The fruit, which is the largest edible fruit native to 
America, is high in amino acids.  The Iroquois used 
the mashed fruit to make small cakes that were dried 
and stored.  The dried cakes were soaked in water 
and cooked to make a sauce or relish that was served 
with corn bread.  Raw and cooked fruits were dried 
by the sun or on a fire.  These were stored for use in 
the future or taken on hunts.  The Cherokee used the 
inner bark to make cordage.  By twisting the bark, 
they made string and strong ropes.  
 
Other:  The twigs and leaves contain extracts that 
have insecticidal properties.  The leaves contain anti-
carcinogens. 
 
Wildlife: Opossum, raccoon, foxes and squirrels eat 
the fruits. Larvae of the lovely Zebra Swallowtail 
butterfly (Eurytides marcellus) feed exclusively on 
the leaves.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Description='General: Custard-apple or Annona family 
(Annonaceae).  This perennial tree or shrub grows 
from 3 to 12 m tall. The drooping, pear-shaped leaves 
are alternate, from 10 to 30 cm long, with smooth 
margins and pointed tips.  The leaves are coated with 
fine whitish hairs on the upper surface with rusty-
colored hairs on the under-side.  Leaves are aromatic, 
with a smell reminiscent of bell pepper. 
Inconspicuous but interesting flowers (4 to 5cm in 
diameter) with 3 sepals, are green upon opening and 
turn to dark purple or maroon in color.  From 1 to 4 
flowers grow in the leaf axils before leafing, usually 
in April or May.  The six velvety petals (2cm-2.5cm 
long) are stiff and curl slightly backwards.  Yellowish 
green to brown, cylindrical, mango-shaped fruits are 
7-16 cm long and grow solitarily or 2 to 4 together.  
The large fruits (5 to 16 ounces) ripen between 
August and October.  Fruits have a thin skin, which 
contain a yellow custard-like pulp that is said to taste 
like papaya.  Some varieties contain a whitish-green 
pulp that is less flavorful.  Fruits contain several flat 
2cm long seeds.  The deciduous leaves turn bright 
yellow before dropping in the fall.  
 
Similar species: A. parivflora, is called the “dwarf 
pawpaw” or “possum-simmon.”  A. tetramera, 
commonly known as ‘opossum pawpaw’, is a rare 
and endangered species from southern Florida. Other 
similar species include A. incarna, A. longifolia, A. 
obovata, A. pygmaea, A. reticulata, A. X nashii.

have a conical pyramid-like shape when grown in 
sun, and a more open structure if grown in shade. 
They can be planted in the shade of tall, open trees or 
in partial shade, although they fruit best in sun.  If 
planting in open sun, provide a shading structure to 
allow filtered sun for the first few years.  The plants 
prefer moist, slightly acidic soils and require regular 
watering, but are adaptable to many conditions.  They 
do not perform well in poorly drained soils and need 
protection from the wind.  At least two plants are 
needed for cross-pollination.   
 
Seeds:  Seeds can be sown in the fall to over-winter 
or can be stratified by exposing to cold temperature 
(32-40 degrees) for 90 to 120 days.  Seed should 
never be allowed to dry out.  If sowing seeds into 
containers use deep pots or tubes to allow for healthy 
roots. 
 
Transplanting seedlings:  Transplant seedlings in the 
spring.  Larger plants do not transplant well.  The 
roots are widely spreading, so purchase plants that 
have been grown in deep pots or tubes to insure 
healthy plants.  The roots are brittle, so use care when 
transferring from containers.  Water the transplants

Ethnobotanic: Milkweed has been used for fiber, 
food, and medicine by people all over the United 
States and southern Canada.  Fibers from the stems of 
milkweed have been identified in prehistoric textiles 
in the Pueblo region.  Tewa-speaking people of the 
Rio Grande still make string and rope from these 
fibers.  At the Zuni Pueblo, the silky seed fibers are 
spun on a hand-held wooden spindle and made into 
yarn and woven into fabric, especially for dancers.  
Pueblo people ate green milkweed pods and 
uncooked roots from one of the species that forms 
fleshy tubers underground. 
 
Milkweeds supply tough fibers for making cords and 
ropes, and for weaving a coarse cloth.  Milkweed 
stems are collected after the stalks senesce in late fall 
to early winter.  The dried stalks are split open to 
release the fibers.  Milkweed fibers are sometimes 
mixed with fibers of Indian-hemp (Apocynum 
cannabinum).  The bark is removed and the fibers 
                          Plant Guide  
 
released by first rubbing between the hands and then 
drawing the fibers over a hard surface.  The cord is  
 
formed by twisting the fiber opposite each other and 
twining them together.  Often this is accomplished by 
rolling the fibers on the thigh, while twisting them 
together. 
 
The young shoots, stems, flower buds, immature 
fruits, and roots of butterfly milkweed were boiled 
and eaten as a vegetable by various indigenous 
groups of eastern and mid-western America.   
 
Butterfly milkweed has many medicinal uses.  The 
Omahas and Poncas ate the raw root of the butterfly 
milkweed for bronchial and pulmonary troubles.  
Butterfly milkweed root was also chewed and placed 
on wounds, or dried, pulverized, and blown into 
wounds.  The Omaha tribe used butterfly milkweed 
medicine for rites belonging to the Shell Society.  
The Dakotas used the butterfly milkweed as an 
emetic.  The Menominis considered the butterfly 
milkweed, which they called the &quot.deceiver,&quot. one of 
their most important medicines.   
 
Generalized medicinal uses for milkweed species 
include 1) its use in a salve for scrofulous swelling, 
2) as a diarrhea medicine, 3) drunk by mothers 
unable to produce milk, 4) medicine for snow 
blindness and other forms of blindness, 5) relief of 
sore throat, 6) applied chewed root for swelling and 
rashes, 7) to expel tapeworm, 8) to treat colic, 9) to 
act as contraceptives, and 10) to cure snakebite.   
 
European Americans used Asclepias tuberosa, called 
&quot.pleurisy root&quot., to relieve inflammation of the lining 
of the lungs and thorax, and to relieve bronchial and 
pulmonary trouble.  Pleurisy root is a stimulant to the 
vagus nerve, producing perspiration, expectoration, 
and bronchial dilation.  As its name signifies, it is 
useful for pleurisy and mild pulmonary edema, 
increasing fluid circulation, cilia function, and 
lymphatic drainage.  The root of the butterfly 
milkweed, was officially listed in the U.S. 
Pharmacopoeia from 1820 to 1905 and in the 
National Formulary from 1916 to 1936. 
 
Milkweed species, as a group, are known to contain 
cardiac glycosides that are poisonous both to humans 
and to livestock, as well as other substances that may 
account for their medicinal effect.  Resinoids, 
glycosides, and a small amount of alkaloids are

present in all parts of the plant.  Symptoms of 
poisoning by the cardiac glycosides include dullness, 
weakness, bloating, inability to stand or walk, high 
body temperature, rapid and weak pulse, difficulty 
breathing, dilated pupils, spasms, and coma. 
 
The cardiac glycoside in milkweed has also been 
useful as a chemical defense for monarch butterflies 
(Danaus plexippus).  Chemicals from the milkweed 
plant make the monarch caterpillar s flesh distasteful 
to most predators.  Monarch butterflies are specific to 
milkweed plants.  This is the only type of plant on 
which the eggs are laid and the larvae will feed and 
mature into a chrysalis.  Eggs are laid on the 
underside of young healthy leaves.  Monarch, Queen, 
and Viceroy butterflies are Müllerian mimics, all are 
toxic, and have co-evolved similar warning patterns 
to avoid predation. 
 
Wildlife: Milkweed species are attractive to many 
insect species, including the large milkweed bug, 
common milkweed bug, red milkweed beetle, blue 
milkweed beetle, and bees.  Accordingly, this is a 
wonderful horticultural plant for landscaping to 
attract butterflies (particularly monarchs), whose 
numbers are declining and migratory routes changing 
due to lack of appropriate habitat.  Butterfly 
milkweed also has strikingly beautiful flowers. 
 
Caution: At one time, milkweed was classified as a 
noxious weed due to reported toxic effects on 
livestock, and efforts were made to eradicate it.  
Milkweeds are thought to be poisonous to cows and 
sheep.  Milkweed also can have invasive 
characteristics in disturbed areas.

species name, tuberosa,  means full of swellings or 
knobs, referring to the enlarged root system.&quot.  
Butterfly milkweed stems are hairy, erect, and grow 
in numerous clumps.  There is a watery sap within 
the stems and leaves.  The leaves are alternate, 
simple, crowded, lance-shaped, 5-10 cm long, shiny 
green, smooth above and velvety beneath.  The 
flowers are in showy, rounded to flat-topped groups 
 
 
near the ends of branches.  Each flower has 5 petals, 
bent downward, orange to red or sometimes yellow, 
topped by a crown of 5 erect hoods, each one

Harvest or divide plants and get the plants in the

growth to survive the winter.  Irrigation the first year 
will improve survival, and by the second year the 
root system should be well enough established so 
plants will survive on their own.

When used for fiber, milkweed is collected in the 
autumn after the leaves have begun to fall off, the 
stalks turn gray or tan, and the plant dries up.  If the 
milkweed stems will break off at the ground it s time 
to harvest.  Breaking off as many stalks as possible 
encourages resprouting in the spring.  The dried 
stalks are then split open and the fibers are twisted 
into string. 
 
Vast quantities of fiber plants are required for nets, 
regalia, and cordage.  Blackburn and Anderson 
(1993) quote Craig Bates of the Yosemite Museum 
that it takes approximately five stalks of milkweed or 
Indian hemp to manufacture one foot of cordage.  A 
Sierra Miwok feather skirt or cape contained about 
100 feet of cordage made from approximately 500 
plant stalks, while a deer net 40 feet in length (Barrett 
and Gifford 1933:178) contained some 7,000 feet of 
cordage, which would have required the harvesting of 
a staggering 35,000 plant stalks.

BLUE WILD INDIGO 
Baptisia australis (L.) R. Br. ex 
Ait. f. 
Plant Symbol = BAAU 
 
Contributed by: USDA NRCS Kansas Plant 
Materials Center 
Cultural:  Presently, Baptisia australis, is grown by 
many as an ornamental in outdoor flower gardens or 
as a decorative border.  It has become popular 
because it grows well in many areas outside its native 
range when planted, does well without watering, 
requires no fertilizer or pesticide treatments and 
needs no pruning.  The pods have been used in dried 
flower arrangements.  When in bloom the brightly 
colored blue flowers arranged in spikes make it very 
attractive.  However, a bouquet of fresh cut flowers 
does not last very long.  The flowers and stems turn 
black as soon as they begin to dry.   
 
 
 
The Cherokees used the plant as a source of blue dye 
for their clothes.  Early pioneer settlers copied this 
practice.  A common name, false indigo, indicates it 
is not the true indigo plant (Indigofera tinctoria L.) 
which was introduced from the India subcontinent 
and cultivated for blue dye by many landowners 
during the early settlement of America.  Some Indian 
tribes used it for medicinal purposes.  The Osage 
made eyewash from the plant.  The Cherokees would 
make a tea from it.  A hot tea was taken as a 
purgative and a cold tea to prevent vomiting.  A 
pulverized root or hot tea was held over a sore tooth 
to relieve the pain.   Indian children would use the 
dried pods with the loose seeds inside as rattles.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_='Blue wild indigo is a native, perennial, deep 
rooted warm season legume which reproduces by 
seed or rhizomes.  The leaves are alternate and 
trifoliate.  The plant is erect, rising from a branched 
root system which has root tubercles.  It branches at 
the top with the flowers in an erect short terminal 
raceme at the pinnacle.  The stems are stout and 
glabrous.  It may grow up to 5 feet tall and 3 feet 
wide.  Normally, it is about 3 feet tall and 2 feet 
wide.  The flowers are hermaphroditic, about 1 inch 
long and may range in color from light blue to deep 
purple.  The fruit is an inflated hardened pod from 1 
to 3 inches long and from 1/2 to 1 inch in diameter.  
When mature the pods contain a number of small 
seeds, which are loose.  Depending on the region it 
may flower from April (in the south) through August

(in the north).  It is in leaf approximately one month 
before flowering to one month after the pods have 
formed.  In the autumn when full maturity is reached 
the plant turns silvery-gray, and breaks off from the 
root system at ground level.  The pods stay with the 
plant for some time while the wind tumbles it around 
to a new location.  The leaves and pods turn black 
upon drying.  When it is growing if a leaf is crushed 
or stem is broken the sap turns a slate blue color 
when exposed to the air. 
Distribution: It occurs from Nebraska to Texas on the 
west to the eastern seaboard states.  It reaches into 
Canada in its middle range and New Hampshire is the 
extreme northeast area it occurs as a native.  It is 
rarely found near the Gulf or Atlantic coasts. For 
current distribution, please consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site.  
 
 
 
 
Habitat: Larger populations can be found along tree 
lines, bordering forested riparian areas and in open 
prairies or native hay meadows.  It does not grow 
well in shaded habitats.  It prefers gravelly, sandy or 
well-drained loamy soils.  It withstands prolonged 
droughts. Like many legumes it can fix nitrogen in 
the soil.

More modern literature documents this genus as more

australis contains several quinolizidine alkaloids 
including anagyrine, cystinine, lupaninne, N-
methylcystisine, rhombifoline, sparteine, and 
tinctorine.  Alkaloids have a bitter taste and make the 
plant unpalatable for grazing animals.  If other forage 
is available it is unlikely any detrimental effects from 
Baptisia will be seen.  No poisonings of people or 
pets have been recorded.  Recent German research 
indicates some Baptisia species may act as stimulants 
to the human immune system.

seeds sorted prior to bringing them inside. If these 
precautions are not taken it is likely several dozen 
weevils will immediately escape when the pod is 
opened.  Like many other legumes it has a hard seed 
coat.  The seeds must be scarified if germination is to 
occur within an artificial setting.  Also, studies 
involving stratification and soaking the seeds a full 
day prior to planting show more success than 
scarification alone.  The seeds normally germinate 
when the soil temperature nears 50 degrees 
Fahrenheit.  After seedlings emerge they can be

the patch regularly and protect it from small and large 
mammals, insects, and birds.  Keep the ground

If planting seeds of harvest brodiaea, store the seeds 
in a paper sack until autumn.  Plant the seeds before 
October 1st in a container and care for them for two 
years before out-planting.  Plant the seeds in six-inch 
pots because the corms will pull themselves down to 
the depth they require.  Plant about 100 seeds per pot.  
Place them on top of the soil and sprinkle a little soil 
over them and put one-quarter inch gravel on top.  
Set the pots in partial shade so they won t dry out so

regular weeding and the use of a very weak solution

thinning them every three years.  This involves 
picking off the cormlets and replanting them 
elsewhere in the garden.   
 
There are five major types of indigenous 
management activities conducted in California that 
were designed to ensure future corm production at 
traditional gathering sites: 1) conscious breaking off 
cormlets from the harvested parent corms and 
replanting them. 2) sparing whole plants. 3) 
harvesting the corms after plants have gone to seed 
and dumping the seeds in the hole. 4) burning areas. 
and 5) irrigation.  Periodic digging and thinning of 
the corms, and popping off the cormlets and 
replanting them may enhance grass nut numbers and 
densities.  Digging corms may in fact be a form of 
tillage, which will increase the size of the gathering 
tract, aerate the soil, lower weed competition, and 
prepare the seedbed to increase seed germination 
rates.  If harvest brodiaea populations require 
periodic disturbance to maintain and increase their 
populations, then indigenous harvesting regimes if 
reenacted, may help maintain populations.  At the 
very least--populations that become overcrowded and 
show reduced vigor should be divided and separated.

beautyberry is a native, perennial shrub.  These small, 
deciduous shrubs reach from 1 to 2 m in height.  The 
leaves are opposite, elliptical to ovate in shape (7 to 
15 cm long) and have saw-toothed margins.  The 
under-side of the leaves can be covered with white or 
rust-colored woolly hairs.  The inconspicuous blue, 
violet, pink, or white flowers are borne in axillary 
clusters that bloom from late spring to early summer.  
The flowers are funnel-shaped with four clefs.  The 
round, showy, violet or magenta drupes or fruits are 
4-5 mm in diameter.  The very juicy fruits, containing 
from 2 to 4 seeds, begin to ripen in August or 
September.  These colorful fruits remain on the 
shrubs long after the leaves drop.   
 
Distribution: For current distribution, please consult 
the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site.   
 
Habitat: American beautyberry shrubs occur in dry 
open woods, moist woods, thickets and hammocks.  
They occur as understudy species in upland pine 
forests, upper slope pine-oak forests and old-growth 
maritime forests.  These shrubs are adapted to 
climates with hot, humid summers and moderate

material used by central California Native 
Americans, who use the long white rhizomes for the 
sewing strand in coiled baskets.  White root was used 
by over one third of California tribes for basket 
weaving.  Traditionally tended white root plants may 
have rhizomes as long as 4- 6 feet in length. untended 
plants have short, twisted rhizomes.  Sandy, moist 
soils are the preferred locations for production of 
long rhizomes. 
 
                          Plant Guide  
 
Other uses of white root include gathering the shoots 
into a loose knot to hold worms for fishing or to 
gather eggs.  The Miwok occasionally used sedge 
leaves to cover the floor where spectators sat in the 
roundhouse.  Today they use pine needles. 
 
A significant portion of the riparian forest understory 
was tended prior to European settlement.  It is highly 
likely that most areas with desirable rhizomes were 
harvested every two to four years.  This maintained a 
lawn-like, grassy appearance under California 
riparian forests.  Given the high population of native 
peoples in California, particularly in the low 
elevation range of Carex barbarae, it is probable that 
most available plants in suitable soils were 
sustainably harvested. 
 
White root is one of the most difficult plants for 
basket weavers to obtain due to elimination of 
traditional gathering sites and difficulty accessing 
those still remaining.  Valley oak riparian woodlands 
have diminished to less than five percent of their 
original range.  Carex barbarae, as an understory 
dominant, has been reduced even further.  Many 
traditional gathering sites have been eliminated or 
destroyed. Where gathering sites still exist, access for 
Indian people to private or public lands has been 
difficult.  Facilitating access for tending and 
gathering traditional materials is a top priority for the 
California Indian Basketweavers Association.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_='Ecological Restoration: Carex barbarae is 
increasingly being recommended for riparian 
restoration, streambank stabilization, and erosion 
control.  Plants establish readily in a wide variety of 
environmental conditions.  Adult plants produce 
many rhizomes each year and each rhizome can be 
used for revegetation.  Subdivision of adult plants 
also results in very high plant survival and rapid 
colonization.  Seeds are fairly easy to germinate, and 
seedlings are easy to transport and replant.  
Cultivation of Carex barbarae for nursery stock has 
only been recently initiated and studies are underway 
to determine optimum revegetation procedures.  This 
plant is useful for green stripping outside riparian 
areas, causing fires to lay down before reaching the 
forested areas along rivers.  Mature plants have well-
developed, deep root systems and are therefore 
resilient to low intensity fire.

by many kinds of wildlife.  Waterfowl and ducks eat 
sedge seeds frequently in small to fair amounts.  
Sedges are also of value to rails, grouse and to seed-
eating songbirds.  Carex species seeds, along with 
insects, are the most regular item of diet of grouse 
chicks.  Birds known to eat sedge seeds include 
coots, ducks (such as wood ducks, canvasbacks, 
mallards, pintails, teal, shoveler), marsh birds and 
shorebirds (dowichers, rails, and sandpipers), upland 
gamebirds (grouse, pheasant, and wild turkey), and 
songbirds (house finch, junco, sparrow, and towhee).  
In addition to providing food for many wildlife 
species, sedges are also valuable for cover.  
Frequently they provide nesting cover for ducks, and 
their tufted growth furnishes concealment and 
bedding for other animals.  
 
Wood ducks nest in the trees above the sedges.  The 
grassy beds soften the fall of fledglings as they 
plunge from their nests to the ground.  White root 
seeds and leaves are eaten by black bear, jack rabbit, 
porcupine, squirrels, moles and other small rodents.  
The sedge plants provide cover and habitat for 
reptiles and amphibians, rabbits, raccoons, deer, 
porcupines, opossums, and skunks.  Beavers, otters, 
muskrats and minks make their way through the 
sedges as they go to and from the water.  White root 
also stabilizes the bank and provides bank overhang 
for fish and invertebrate species habitat.

stay diminutive for over a year, with plant leaves 
remaining stunted and fragile for a considerable

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_='Live Plant Collections: No more than 1/4 of the 
plants in an area should be collected. a depth of 15 
cm (6 in) is sufficiently deep for digging plugs.  This 
will leave enough plants and roots to grow back 
during the next growing season. 
 
Live transplants should be planted as soon as 
possible.  Plants should be transported and stored in a 
cool location prior to planting.  Plugs may be split 
into smaller units, generally no smaller than 6 x 6 cm 
(2.4 x 2.4 in) with healthy rhizomes and tops.  Weeds 
in the plugs should be removed by hand.  For ease in 
transport, soil may be washed gently from roots.  The

roots should always remain moist or in water until 
planted.  
 
Clip leaves and stems from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 
inches). this allows the plant to allocate more energy 
into root production.  Planting densities of 
approximately 1 meter centers provide full coverage 
the first year (given good site conditions).  Plant 
densities should be increased with fine soils such as 
clay or silt, steep slopes or prolonged inundation.  
Use an annual grass cover with white root plantings 
the first year to facilitate sediment deposition.  When 
plants are isolated clumps, erosion tends to occur 
around each plant.  The annual grass covers works 
well for mid-slope sites with minimal erosion.  For 
more extreme hydrology or steeper slopes, use filter 
fabric to stabilize sites.  
 
Ideally, plants should be planted in late fall just after 
the first rains (usually late October to November).  
This enables plant root systems to become 
established before heavy flooding and winter 
dormancy occurs.  Survival is highest when plants are 
dormant, temperatures are cool, and soils are moist.  
Plants usually need to be planted by hand, as soils are 
too moist to use machines. 
 
Seed Collections 
•  Seed can be harvested by hand or 
mechanically with a stripper header.  Collect 
seeds when they are ripe, from July to 
September.  Make sure seed heads are full. 
•  Plant clean seeds in the fall in weed free, 
moist seedbeds.   
•  Planting seeds after weeds have germinated.  
Burning, disking, raking, hoeing, or weeding 
by hand can control weeds.   
•  Most Indian people in gathering sites do not 
approve of herbicides.  Many other people 
have objections to the use of herbicides, so 
caution and sensitivity is advised. 
•  Broadcast seed and roll in or rake 1/4&quot. to 1/2&quot. 
below the soil surface. 
•  Hold off watering so seeds doesn t float out. 
•  Some seeds may be lost due to scour or 
flooding. 
and seeds. 
•  Use erosion control blankets to protect soil 
•  Plants grown from seeds and planted from 
container stock have higher transplant 
survival than direct seeding. 
•  Recommended seed density is unknown at 
this time.  In greenhouse germination 
experiment done by Stevens (1999), a high 
temperature was required for germination.  
Below 18°C, very little if any seed 
germinated.  Between 21°C and 30.5°C, 
germination of pure live seed was 14 to 23% 
for seeds grown in higher nitrate fertilizer 
treatment, and 5 to 17% germination for 
seeds grown at low nitrate fertilization 
treatment.  Above 31.5°C, seeds desiccated 
or failed to germinate, and germination 
results were very low. 
•  As expected, at high nitrate levels both high 
rates of biomass and fecundity are greatly 
increased.  Fertilizing plants at moderate 
nitrate levels increased flower stalk and seed 
production, seed weight, and seed viability.  
A number of studies show that increasing 
temperatures from 21°C to 32°C increases 
germination percentages.

Traditional Native American tending practices 
removed competing species and impediments to

through pruning rhizomes.  Plants were harvested 
every two to four years, and less than one third of the 
plants were harvested.  The season of harvest was 
late fall through early spring, coinciding with the 
times that the plants were dormant and soils were 
moist.  In some cases, plants were replanted into new

they were undoubtedly utilized by the Salinan as 
well.  The shiny black seeds were a major ingredient 
in pinole (from the Aztec word for seed flour, pinolli) 
and were valued for their high oil content.  The 
Chumash called the seed xutash or pil (Timbrook 
1986).  The name pil is reported in Onlone usage for 
redmaid seeds (Bocek 1984).  Fages (1937) names pil 
as the seed of a plant used by the Salinan.   
 
The Miwok harvested the seeds in early summer 
(Barrett &amp. Gifford1933).  The plants were pulled and 
spread out on a clean area to dry.  The seeds were 
separated by shaking or hitting the plants over the 
cleaned area or into a basket.  Then they were placed 
into a tightly woven winnowing basket where they 
were tossed, allowing the moving air to remove any 
chaff.  The seeds were then dried for storage or

were used by the Pima as splints to bind injured 
limbs and as cross pieces in the manufacture of  
 
babies  cradles.  The Seri in Mexico used a piece of 
the saguaro rib to make the mainshaft or handle of a 
compound drill stick used in fire making.  The ribs 
also were used as walking canes and in the making of 
wattle and daub house walls. 
 
Wildlife: The white-wing dove feeds on saguaro 
seeds during the fruiting season.  Gila woodpeckers 
and gilded flickers make holes in the trunks and use 
them as nests.  After these are abandoned, they are 
inhabited by elf owls and starlings.

cabinetry, paneling, and agriculture implements.   
 
Medicinal: Pecan was used by the Comanche as a 
treatment for ringworm.  They would pulverize the 
leaves and rubbed them on the infected part of the 
ringworm.  The Kiowa would consume a decoction 
made from the bark of pecan for tuberculosis 
(Moerman 1998). 
 
Wildlife: Seedling and lower branches of older pecan 
trees are browsed heavily by white-tailed deer.  Many 
birds, opossums, raccoons, and squirrels eat pecan 
nuts.  This tree provides cover for a variety of birds 
and mammals in the forests of southeastern United 
States.   
 
Agroforestry: Pecan trees are valuable species in 
alley cropping systems.  An agricultural crop is 
grown simultaneously with a long-term tree crop to 
provide annual income while the tree crop matures.  
Fine hardwoods, such as pecan trees, are planted side 
by side in alleys, or strips in alley cropping systems 
and can potentially provide high value logs for 
lumber or veneer.

General: Walnut Family (Junglandaceae).  Pecan is a 
native, medium to large sized deciduous tree ranging 
from 100-140 feet.  The leaves are alternate, 
pinnately compound, ten to twenty inches long, 
eleven to seventeen leaflets that are four to eight 
inches long (Harrar &amp. Harrar 1962).  The flowers are 
unisexual, both sexes are borne in separate clusters 
on the same tree.  The fruit is thin-shelled nuts. four 
winged from base to apex, borne in clusters of three 
to twelve (Ibid.).  A ridge is formed where the two 
halves of the outer fruit come together.  The fruit is 
dark brown in color and covered with yellow scales.  
The husk is thin and brittle.  The husk often persists 
on the branch into the winter after dropping the nut.  
The nut is thin shelled with a reddish-brown color 
and pointed at both ends.  The bark is grayish brown 
or light brown and is flat ridged and shallowly 
furrowed.

Distribution: Pecan is native from Iowa to Indiana to 
Alabama, Texas and Mexico (Dirr 1990).  This tree 
follows the river basins very closely, principally 
along the Mississippi and its tributaries, the Colorado 
River in Texas, and along some of its tributaries in 
Mexico.  For current distribution, please consult the 
Plant profile page for this species on the PLANTS 
Web site.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Adaptation TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Adaptation='Pecan trees commonly grow on rich, moist, well-
drained soils that are not subject to prolonged 
flooding.  It appears near river bottoms and on heavy 
textured soil.  This species grows in a humid climate 
usually appearing with sweet gum, water oak, 
poplars, honey locust, and American elm.  It grows 
best where summer temperatures average 24-30º C. 
Pecan is susceptible to fire damage due to the low 
insulating capacity of the bark.  Post-fire re-
colonization occurs via seeds carried to the site by 
animals and water. 
 
' WHERE symbol='cail2';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Propagation from Seed: Seeds are best sown in a cold 
frame as soon as they are ripe.  Pecan seeds show 
delayed germination and require a period of cold 
stratification.  Seeds should be stratified at 36-41º F 
for thirty to sixty days and then followed by 
incubation at room temperature.  The seedlings 
should be transplanted when they are large enough to 
handle and planted in deep pots to accommodate the 
taproot.  Put the plants in their permanent positions as 
soon as possible, preferable during the first summer, 
and give them some protection from the cold for the 
first winter (Sheat 1948).  Pecan requires a frost-free 
period of 6 to 9 months for nuts to be produced and 
mature.  The trees require 1 to 2 inches of rain per 
week during the growing season. 
 
Propogation by root sprouting: Nuts sown in the fall 
are subjected to the necessary cold stratification and 
will germinate in the spring in moist soils.  Pecan can 
also be propagated through root sprouting, but does 
not respond well to transplanting.  Pecan trees prefer 
deep, moist soils, in full sun. 
 
' WHERE symbol='cail2';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='The best time to plant pecan trees is during the 
months of December, January, and February.  The 
hole should preferable be dug six or eight inches 
wider than extended lateral roots and eight inches 
deeper than the length of the taproot.  Very little 
pruning is needed since pecan trees form a natural, 
vase shaped canopy.  Remove only diseased, dead, or 
broken limbs on a regular basis.   
 
 
 
Pecan trees are susceptible to a variety of insects, 
pests and diseases.  It is best to establish a good 
disease and insect control program to protect this 
species.  Grown in its native habitat and using local 
seed stock, pecan should not be prone to debilitating 
pests.  Pecan often suffers from zinc deficiency.  To 
compensate for this the trees should be sprayed every 
2 to 4 weeks in the spring and early summer with 
zinc sulfate.  Soil tests will ensure the proper amount 
of zinc sulfate is applied.

The Nitinaht believed that picking &quot.grasses&quot. for 
baskets and mats (such as, Carex obnupta and 
Scirpus pungens) causes fog.  The fisherman were 
always getting annoyed with the women who 
harvested these materials, because they were always 
making it foggy.  It is said that Hesaquiat men shaved 
with this &quot.grass&quot. because the edges are so sharp.  
There is a saying in Hesaquiat which means &quot.you re 
just like citapt, (Carex obnupta) you never change,&quot. 
because citapt is always the same and never seems to 
change in appearance.  
 
Erosion Control: Carex obnupta provides erosion 
control and streambank stabilization.  The dense 
swards of slough sedge provide sediment retention 
and nutrient uptake, thus contributing to water quality 
improvement.  Emergent wetland plant communities 
dominated by slough sedge provide the following 
hydrologic functions: 
•  maintaining river or stream meander patterns.   
• 
providing a broad, shallow plain where 
streamflow velocities slow and sediment 
deposition occurs.  
stormwater abatement.  
a mixing zone where brackish and 
freshwaters meet. and 
nutrient-rich habitat for aquatic organisms, 
fish, waterfowl, and predators such as otter, 
bald eagles, herons, and raccoons to feed.

Wildlife: The lens-shaped seeds of sedges are eaten 
by many kinds of wildlife.  Birds known to eat sedge 
seeds include coots, ducks (such as wood ducks, 
canvasbacks, mallards, pintails, teal, shoveler), marsh 
birds and shorebirds (dowichers, rails, and 
sandpipers), upland gamebirds (grouse, pheasant, and 
wild turkey), and songbirds (house finch, junco, 
sparrow, and towhee).  Waterfowl and ducks eat 
sedge seeds frequently in small to fair amounts.  In 
addition to providing food for many wildlife species, 
sedges are also valuable for cover.  Frequently they 
provide nesting cover for ducks, and their tufted 
growth furnishes concealment and bedding for other 
animals.  Beavers, otters, muskrats and minks make 
their way through the sedges as they go to and from 
the water.  
 
Invasive Potential: This plant is densely rhizomatous, 
and can be invasive in pastures or wet meadows.

is a robust sedge that grows 60-150 cm tall. this 
densely tufted, grasslike plant has stout, creeping 
rhizomes.  The leaves are w-shaped, coarse, with the 
margins rolled under.  The 4-8 cylindrical flower 
spikes are very large and long (5-12 cm) and loosely 
aggregated at the tip.  Carex lyngbyei is a similar 
species.

For current distribution, please consult the Plant 
Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web

San Luis County in California north through Oregon 
and Washington to British Columbia.  Slough sedge 
occurs at elevations below 900 m. 
' WHERE symbol='caob3';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_ TEXT;
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Adaptation: Slough sedge is an obligate wetland 
species that prefers fresh water.  It grows in wet, 
shallow, inundated woods, meadows, roadside 
ditches, coastal swamps, lakeshores, bogs, marshes, 
and riverbanks.  In muddy areas it can grow as a 
dense, single-species stand.  It often grows in 
association with skunk cabbage (Lysichiton 
americanum).  Slough sedge is very similar to 
Lyngbye s sedge in growth form and appearance.  
Both species tolerate brackish often saline coastal 
wetland areas. they often grow in similar habitats 
where saltwater and freshwater meet, such as at the 
mouths of rivers entering the Pacific Ocean, lagoons, 
or the Puget Sound. 
 
General: Carex obnupta may be planted from bare 
root stock, seedlings from container stalk, or directly 
seeded into the soil.  Bare root stock or seedlings are 
preferred revegetation methods, particularly in areas 
with moving water.  Since slough sedge often grows 
in areas that are hydrologically quite dynamic, with 
both tidal and fluvial influences, bare root stock 
plantings are generally recommended.  Seeds 
generally wash away in these conditions.  Also, 
plants started from seeds tend to stay diminutive for 
over a year, with plant leaves remaining stunted and 
fragile for a considerable period of time. 
 
Live Plant Collections: Live plant collections are 
appropriate only under a very limited set of 
conditions.  Loss of wetland ecosystems exceeds 
50% in most states and estuarine wetland losses have 
been as high as 90%.  Public lands that allow plant 
collections, require permits.  Permission from the 
landowner must be acquired to collect on private 
lands.  No more than 1/4 of the plants in an area 
 
 
should be collected. a depth of 15 cm (6 in) is 
sufficiently deep enough for digging plugs.  This will 
leave enough plants and roots to grow back during 
the growing season. 
 
Live transplants should be planted as soon as 
possible.  Plants should be transported and stored in a 
cool location prior to planting.  Plugs may be split 
into smaller units, generally no smaller than 6 x 6 cm 
(2.4 x 2.4 in) with healthy rhizomes and tops.  Weeds 
in the plugs should be removed by hand.  For ease in 
transport, soil may be washed gently from roots.  The 
roots should always remain moist or in water until 
planted.  
 
Clip leaves and stem from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 
inches). this allows the plant to allocate more energy 
into root production and makes plants easier to 
handle (the leaves can be sharp).  Planting densities 
of approximately 1 meter centers provide full 
coverage the first year (given good site conditions).  
If there is flowing water, increase planting densities 
to 1/2-meter centers.  Plant densities should also be 
increased with fine soils such as clay or silt, steep 
slopes or prolonged inundation. 
 
Ideally, plants should be planted in fall just after the 
first rains, depending on the climate and geographic 
location.  This enables plant root systems to become 
established before heavy flooding and winter 
dormancy occurs.  Planting survival is highest when 
plants are dormant, temperatures are cool, and soils 
are moist.  Plants usually need to be planted by hand, 
as soils are too moist to use machines. 
 
In some areas, winter storms and high tides would 
wash away newly transplanted seedlings.  While in 
other areas, avoiding high tides and high floods is 
recommended, because this combination will 
minimize plant survival.  Planting in the spring after 
high floods may be warranted in this situation.

•  Recommended seed density is unknown at 
this time.  Sedges tend to have low 
germination rates.  While exact seeding 
prescriptions are unknown at this time, 
estimates of from 25% to 50% would be 
reasonable based on other Carex species. 
•  Nitrate fertilization greatly increases both 
 
 
biomass production and fecundity.  
Fertilizing plants at moderate nitrate levels 
increases flower stalk and seed production, 
seed weight, and seed viability.

•  Clean seed - blow out light seeds. 
•  Put in water with sphagnum moss. 
•  Cold stratify seeds by putting in a cooler for 
30 days to improve germination rates. 
•  To grow seeds, plant in greenhouse in 1&quot. x 1&quot. 
x 2&quot. pots, 1/4&quot. under the soil surface. Keep 
moist at 100 ° F (plus or minus 5 degrees).  
Sedges require high temperatures and 
constant moisture for successful germination.  
Seeds begin to germinate after two weeks in 
warm temperatures.   
•  Plants are ready in 100 - 120 days to come 
out as plugs.  These plants are very small. for 
planting, larger plugs in spring will improve 
revegetation success.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='The leaves of slough sedge are cut in late summer 
(August) (Turner et al. 1983).  A knife was used to 
cut the plant at the base, as low to the ground as 
possible.  The best plants were said to be those 
growing in 10 cm (4&quot.) of water.  The cluster of leaves 
are cut off or pulled from the tender white bases, 
where they break off at or just below the ground 
level.  Only the non-flowering, vegetative plants, 
called the &quot.female&quot. plants, were gathered.  
 
The harvested sedge leaves are bundled and taken 
home, where they are sorted according to size. the 
longest ones, considered the best, were put together 
and dried.  After the leaves have dried slightly, they 
are split exactly in half lengthwise, from bottom to 
top, using the thumbnail.  After being split, the leaves 
 
 
are dried completely and bleached in the sun.  They 
can then be bundled or stored.  
 
Traditional Resource Management: Conservation 
practices include the following: 1) gathering only 
during late summer after seeds are produced. 2) 
gathering only infertile shoots without flowering 
stalks. 3) weeding out competing species and 
removing impediments to growth such a stones and 
branches. 4) pruning shoots causes sedges to 
retranslocate nutrients belowground, providing a 
nutrient reserve to stimulate new growth the 
following growing season. 5) removal of long, dense 
shoots provides good opportunities for seedling 
establishment and recruitment. 6) harvesting 
aboveground biomass maintains the sedge clone in 
juvenile and mature life stages, removing decadent 
old portions of plants and stimulating new growth. 
and 7) ownership of sedge beds provides the basis for 
careful tending and sustainable yield of valued 
resources.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Uses='Ethnobotanic: Camas was and continues to be one of 
the most important &quot.root&quot. foods of western North 
American indigenous peoples, from southwestern 
British Columbia to Montana, and south to California 
(Kuhnlein and Turner 1991).  The part of the plant 
that was relished is actually a bulb.  Camas was used 
                          Plant Guide  
 
by Northwest Coast peoples, the Coast Salish of 
Vancouver Island, western Washington groups,  
 
Squamish, Sechelt, Comox, and Kwak-waka wakw of 
the British Columbia coast.  Camas was considered to 
be one of the most important bulbs to local California 
natives.  The Maidu particularly valued great camas.  
 
Except for choice varieties of dried salmon, no other 
food item was more widely traded (Gunther 1973).  
People traveled great distances to harvest the bulbs 
and there is some suggestion that plants were 
dispersed beyond their range by transplanting (Turner 
and Efrat 1982. Turner et al. 1983).  To the Nez 
Perce people, camas is still the most important root in 
trade, and trading is traditionally impossible without 
camas bulbs (Harbinger 1964).  Dried camas is the 
most expensive form of camas, with baked and then 
raw camas being less expensive.  At marriage trades, 
the girl’s family gives roots in corn husk bags.  At 
funeral trades, the widow gives camas roots to friends 
and relatives.  The Nez Perce traded camas roots with 
the Warm Springs, Umatilla, Cayuse, Walla Walla, 
Nespelem, Yakama, Crows, and Flatheads. 
 
The bulbs were usually dug after flowering, in 
summer, although some peoples dug them in spring.  
Harvesting the bulbs traditionally took weeks or 
months among the Nez Perce.  Each family group 
&quot.owned&quot. its own camping spot and harvesting spot.  
These were passed down in families from generation 
to generation.  Turf was lifted out systematically in 
small sections and then replaced after only larger 
bulbs had been removed.  The bulbs were dug with a 
pointed digging stick.  Bulbs were broken up and 
replanted.  Annual controlled burning was used to 
maintain an open prairie-like habitat for optimum 
camas production.  Areas were harvested only every 
few years. 
 
Traditionally, camas bulbs were almost always pit-
cooked.  Within the past 100 years, camas bulbs have 
also been cooked by stovetop methods (Turner and 
Kuhnlein 1983).  The bulbs are allowed to cook for 
24-36 hours when pit-cooked (Turner and Bell 1971).  
It is probable that lengthy cooking is necessary for 
maximum conversion of the inulin in Camassia to 
fructose.  The sweetness of cooked camas gave it 
utility as a sweetener and enhancer of other foods. 
Before sugar, European traders introduced molasses, 
and honey.  Sweetening agents were in short supply 
among native peoples, and camas was highly valued

in this capacity.  Sometimes other foods, such as the 
rhizomes of springbank clover (Trifolium 
wormskioldii) and the roots of Pacific silverweed 
(Potentilla anserina ssp. pacifica) were cooked with 
the camas bulbs.  The Kalapuyan of the Willamette 
Valley in Oregon used to flavor camas with tarweed 
(Madia elegans).  Bulbs don’t keep well fresh.  They 
were cooked or sun-dried and stored for later use. 
Sometimes camas bulbs were pressed flat and made 
into camas cakes the size of biscuits before being 
dried (Turner et al. 1983).  Dried bulbs were re-
constituted by soaking in water, usually overnight. 
 
Many of the traditional camas gathering sites, such as 
Weippe Prairie and Camas Prairie in Idaho and the 
Willamette Valley in Oregon, have been converted to 
agriculture.  The average size of a camas patch 
needed to feed a five person family was 2.7 ha 
(Thoms 1989).  Camas roots are hard to find now. 
Restoration of camas prairies and access to camas 
bulbs are priorities of many Indian people.  At one 
time, “When camas was in bloom in wet meadows, 
the flowers grow so thickly that they look like a blue 
lake” (Murphey 1959).  
 
Camas stalks and leaves were used for making 
mattresses.  It was sometimes used in place of grass 
when baking camas in pits.  Camas is used by the 
Nez Perce as a cough medicine.  It is boiled, and the 
juice is strained and mixed with honey. 
 
Ornamental: Horticulturally, this plant is used for cut 
flowers, beds, borders, ground cover, rock gardens, 
and prairie restoration. 
 
Wildlife: Elk, deer, and moose reportedly graze 
camas early in the spring (Craighead, Craighead, and 
Davis 1963).  Gophers eat camas and move the bulbs 
to another area where they sprout and grow the next 
year (Watson 1988).  Indian women in Oregon’s 
Umpqua Valley robbed camas bulbs from gopher 
caches (Piper 1916).  Herbivorous insects also eat 
camas leaves.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Description='General: Lily Family (Liliaceae).  Common camas 
(Camassia quamash ssp. breviflora) is a stout, robust, 
12-28 inches (30-70 cm) tall plant with a dense 
inflorescence.  Camases are liliaceous, perennial 
herbs that grow from an edible bulb.  The leaves are 
 
 
long and narrow, grass-like, and emerge from the 
base.  Common camas flowers are light to deep blue. 
more than 3 flowers in an inflorescence may be open 
at one time.  Camas flowers have 6 tepals, 6 stamens, 
and 3 stigmas.  The inflorescence is a spike-like 
cluster borne on a leafless stem that is held above the 
leaves.  Common camas is distinguished from great 
camas (Camassia quamash ssp.quamash) by the 
following: the flowers are slightly irregular, with the 
lowest tepal curving outward away from the stem. the 
anthers are bright yellow. the plant is relatively short 
and stout, with shorter flower stalks and smaller 
bulbs. and there is no waxy powder on the leaves.   
Common camas blooms from April through June.  
The fruits are barrel-shaped to three-angled capsules, 
splitting into three parts to release many black, 
angled seeds.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Distribution TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Distribution='Common camas grows in wet meadows, wet prairies, 
swales, depressions, annual floodplains, moist 
hillsides, and streamside areas.  Camas habitat is 
often ephemeral, drying out by late spring.  Common 
camas grows throughout the American West to 
southwest Alberta, Montana, Wyoming, and Utah at 
elevations below 3300 meters.  The southern limit of 
its range in California is the high Sierra Nevada 
Mountains and Modoc Plateau.  In British Columbia, 
common camas is found in moist meadows, rocky 
outcrops, bluffs, and islands in southwestern British 
Columbia, mainly on southwestern Vancouver Island 
and the Gulf Islands.  For current distribution, please 
consult the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Common camas can be propagated from seeds or 
bulbs.  Common camas generally prefers full sun to 
partial shade, with bulb depth ranging from 2-8 
inches (most commonly 4-6 inches deep).  The bulbs 
of common camas can be substantially smaller in size 
and occur at more shallow soil depths than great 
camas.  Bulb depth appears limited by shallow water 
tables, anoxic conditions, or restrictive layers.  The 
occasional occurrence of a large, thick root beneath a 
bulb may aid in re-locating or re-establishing it at a 
greater depth.  Plants require irrigation or moist soil 
conditions to become established, and camas can be 
difficult to establish in California. 
 
' WHERE symbol='caqub2';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_LivePlant_Bulb_Collections TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_LivePlant_Bulb_Collections='Common camas is readily established by 
transplanting wild or commercially grown bulbs.  
Wild harvests should be restricted to salvage sites 
with appropriate approvals or permits.  Due to loss of 
wetland habitat throughout the United States, 

Page 3
harvesting plants from the wild is rarely appropriate 
or legal except under salvage situations.  Use of bulbs 
or seeds from local nurseries or greenhouses is 
strongly recommended. 
 
The best time to excavate bulbs is from early summer 
through mid-fall.  This is the “quiescent” period that 
follows seed maturation, foliar senescence, and 
development of the daughter bulb.  However, 
commercial bulb harvest takes place when the leaves 
are still green and must be done carefully to avoid 
damage.  The bulb tunic or covering is very thin (De 
Hertogh and Le Nard 1993).  Given that camas 
commonly occupies sites high in silt and clay that dry 
out in summer, windows for digging are often 
narrow.  There is a brief period when soils are moist 
after flowering in the spring. the next time to harvest 
is in the fall after the rains begin.  Store the bulbs in a 
dry, dark, cool, well ventilated place in a potting 
medium such as dry peat moss, similar to 
recommendations for fall planted/spring flowering 
bulbs (such as daffodils and tulips).  Keep the bulbs 
from completely drying out and transport or store at 
63-68° F (De Hertogh, Noone and Lutman 1990).  
Common camas reproduces vegetatively by offset 
bulblets (De Hertogh et. al. 1993).  However, much 
less than one percent of a wild population may 
produce offsets and bulbs may be stimulated to do so 
only as the result of a wound (Thoms 1989).  
 
Plant camas outdoors in the fall or early winter, when 
soils are moist enough to dig and prevailing soil 
temperatures are cool.  This is generally below 60°F.  
Fall planting allows for better root development and 
fulfillment of any chilling requirement for flowering 
(De Hertogh et. al. 1993).  Bulbs, bulblets, and 
offsets can be utilized.  However, if flowering is 
desired the following spring, bulbs must be of 
sufficient age (3-5 years old with 3-4 bulb leaves or 
scales) and size (Thoms 1989).  Bulb leaves are 
laminate concentric layers that comprise much of the 
bulb, reminiscent of an onion.  Bulbs with just two 
bulb leaves never flower, those with three routinely 
flower, and those with four almost always flower.  
Older bulbs will be found deeper in the ground, and 
bulbs which flower will probably be at least 0.6-0.8 
inch (1.5-2.0 cm) wide (Thoms 1989).  In the 
commercial bulb trade, the minimum size for export 
and thus flowering is a circumference of 2.4 inches (6 
cm) (De Hertogh and Le Nard 1993).  This is roughly 
equivalent to a diameter of 0.75 inch and about one-
half the diameter and circumference of great camas. 
 
The larger the bulb, the greater the planting depth can 
be.  Planting depth ranges from 0.5-1 inches for 1-2 
year old bulblets up to 4-6 inches for mature bulbs 
 
 
(as measured to their base).  Larger bulbs (1.5 inches 
in diameter or greater) can be planted deeper (8-10 
inches) if drainage is appropriate.  Commercial 
production involves planting from October to 
November in well drained soil of pH 6-7 with at least 
2% organic matter, covering with at least 3 inches of 
soil above the bulb “nose”, applying 2 inches of 
straw mulch, fertilizing with 7-14-28 fertilizer four 
weeks after planting, and harvesting in July (De 
Hertogh, Noone and Lutman 1990).  Keep the camas 
bed damp until it gets warm.  Once plants senesce 
after flowering, stop watering so seeds form and 
bulbs cure.  Suggested spacing for flower beds and 
naturalized landscapes vary from 3-4 inches apart (8-
10 per sq. ft.) to 6-8 inches apart.  Other publications 
recommend 6-8 bulbs every 12 inches for outdoor 
gardens.  A dense “natural” stand may have 9 
plants/sq. ft. (100/sq. meter) or more (Thoms 1989).  
It may be necessary to bury bulbs with a protective 
wire mesh to prevent herbivory.  The mesh needs to 
be coarse enough to allow shoots to grow through 
(De Hertogh et. al. 1993).

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_SeedCollections='Common camas propagates easily from seed.  It can 
be collected as soon as the pods mature (turn light 
brown) or split open to reveal the mature black seeds.  
Pods ripen from late May- July depending on 
latitude, longitude, moisture conditions, or elevation.  
Dry seeds can be stored frozen or in a cool, dry place 
prior to planting.  
 
Camas seed requires 42-100 days of cold  
temperatures (34-40°F) under moist stratification for 
maximum germination (90-100%)(Emery 1988, 
Guerrant and Raven 1995, Deno 1993, Northway 
pers. comm. 1998, Thoms 1989).  “Moist 
stratification” means placement of seeds which are 
“imbibed”, or have soaked up water, in layers of a 
moist medium at cool temperatures to allow for after-
ripening.  Germination also requires cool conditions 
and can occur in the dark (Northway pers. comm. 
1998).  The alternative is to plant seed outdoors in the 
fall (Sept-Oct).  One-leafed, grass-like seedlings will 
emerge in February or March under suitable 
conditions.  Seedlings require moisture through the 
spring growing period to survive.  Warm 
temperatures during seedling development can be 
lethal. 
 
Suggested site preparation methods and seeding rates 
for wetland revegetation are not well known, but a 
broadcast rate of 20 live seeds/sq. ft. for both 
Camassia sub-species resulted in poor to good 
seedling counts the following spring (0-10 or more 
seedlings/sq. ft.) (Darris, pers. comm., 1999).  

Page 4
Seedling success was dependent on weed 
competition, hydrology, type of disturbance, mulch, 
erosion, or other factors.  Camas seedlings were 
inhibited by dense stands of live grass such as Lolium 
multiflorum.  However, seedlings appeared to benefit 
when grown in the mulch of native grass 
(Deschampsia cespitosa), at least on well-drained, 
stable, slightly higher ground (Ibid).  In areas with 
wet, mild winters, soil scarification for shallow seed 
coverage or just constant moisture from irrigation or 
winter rains can result in good germination.  At least 
one grower sows seed directly on the soil surface in 
the fall (Robinson pers. comm. 1999).  However, 
other growers have found that a 1-2 inch covering of 
organic mulch is required during the first growing 
season to protect the tiny bulblet from exposure to 
dry soil, surface cracking, and extreme temperatures.  
Sawdust or a chemically killed dense stand of grass 
works well (Watson pers. comm. 1999).  Seeds 
deeper than 0.4-0.8 inch (1-2 cm) will not germinate 
successfully (Watson 1988).

repellents may be useful, particularly during the first

every spring, but the soil can be allowed to dry out 
soon after the pods mature or the leaves senesce (dry 
up and turn brown).  Moderate soil nutrient levels are 
beneficial.  In natural settings, minor soil disturbance 
(loosening, surface scarification) adjacent to existing 
specimens may enhance natural regeneration by seed.  
Late summer field burning (where and when 
permitted) may improve stand vigor, reduce 
competition from brush and certain weeds, and aid in 
regeneration.  For optimal bulb development, avoid 
mowing or grazing more than lightly, if at all, even 
during foliar senescence.  Individual plants may live 
15-20 years. 
 
Traditional Resource Management (TRM) was often 
intensive, to the point of being considered “semi-
agricultural” by some.  According to Dr. Nancy 
Turner, TRM included the following: 
•  Ownership, demarcation, and inheritance of beds 
or patches,  
•  Clearing of rock, brush, and weedy vegetation,  
•  Harvesting bulbs after seeds were produced, 
during specific times of the year,  
•  Periodic field burning in summer after digging,  
•  In some cases, sod removal then bulb removal 
followed by sod replacement,  
•  Digging or “cultivation” to keep the soil loose,

the most important &quot.root&quot. foods of western North  
 
American indigenous peoples, from southwestern 
British Columbia to Montana, and south to California 
(Kuhnlein and Turner 1991).  The part of the plant 
that was relished is actually a bulb.  Camas was used 
by Northwest Coast peoples, the Coast Salish of 
Vancouver Island, western Washington groups, 
Squamish, Sechelt, Comox, and Kwak-waka wakw of 
the British Columbia coast.  Camas was considered to 
be one of the most important bulbs to local California 
natives.  The Maidu particularly valued great camas.  
 
Except for choice varieties of dried salmon, no other 
food item was more widely traded (Gunther 1973).  
People traveled great distances to harvest the bulbs 
and there is some suggestion that plants were 
dispersed beyond their range by transplanting (Turner 
and Efrat 1982. Turner et al. 1983).  To the Nez 
Perce people, camas is still the most important root in 
trade, and trading is traditionally impossible without 
camas bulbs (Harbinger 1964).  Dried camas is the 
most expensive form of camas, with baked and then 
raw camas being less expensive.  At marriage trades, 
the girl’s family gives roots in corn husk bags.  At 
funeral trades, camas roots are given to friends and 
relatives by the widow.  The Nez Perce traded camas 
roots with the Warm Springs, Umatilla, Cayuse, 
Walla Walla, Nespelem, Yakama, Crows, and 
Flatheads. 
 
The bulbs were usually dug after flowering, in 
summer, although some peoples dug them in spring.  
Harvesting the bulbs traditionally took weeks or 
months among the Nez Perce.  Each family group 
&quot.owned&quot. its own camping spot and harvesting spot.  
These were passed down in families from generation 
to generation.  Turf was lifted out systematically in 
small sections and then replaced after only larger 
bulbs had been removed.  The bulbs were dug with a 
pointed digging stick.  Bulbs were broken up and 
replanted.  Annual controlled burning was used to 
maintain an open prairie-like habitat for optimum 
camas production.  Areas were harvested only every 
few years. 
 
Traditionally, camas bulbs were almost always pit-
cooked.  Within the past 100 years, camas bulbs have 
also been cooked by stovetop methods (Turner and 
Kuhnlein 1983).  The bulbs are allowed to cook for

24-36 hours when pit-cooked (Turner and Bell 1971).  
It is probable that lengthy cooking is necessary for 
maximum conversion of the inulin in Camassia to 
fructose.  The sweetness of cooked camas gave it 
utility as a sweetener and enhancer of other foods. 
Before sugar, European traders introduced molasses, 
and honey.  Sweetening agents were in short supply 
among native peoples, and camas was highly valued 
in this capacity.  Sometimes other foods, such as the 
rhizomes of springbank clover (Trifolium 
wormskioldii) and the roots of Pacific silverweed 
(Potentilla anserina ssp. pacifica) were cooked with 
the camas bulbs.  The Kalapuyan of the Willamette 
Valley in Oregon used to flavor camas with tarweed 
(Madia elegans).  Bulbs don’t keep well fresh.  They 
were cooked or sun-dried and stored for later use. 
Sometimes camas bulbs were pressed flat and made 
into camas cakes the size of biscuits before being 
dried (Turner et al. 1983).  Dried bulbs were re-
constituted by soaking in water, usually overnight. 
 
Many of the traditional camas gathering sites, such as 
Weippe Prairie and Camas Prairie in Idaho and the 
Willamette Valley in Oregon, have been converted to 
agriculture.  The average size of a camas patch 
needed to feed a five person family was 2.7 ha 
(Thoms 1989).  Camas roots are hard to find now. 
Restoration of camas prairies and access to camas 
bulbs are priorities of many Indian people.  At one 
time, “When camas was in bloom in wet meadows, 
the flowers grow so thickly that they look like a blue 
lake” (Murphey 1959:14).  
 
Camas stalks and leaves were used for making 
mattresses.  It was sometimes used in place of grass 
when baking camas in pits.  Camas is used by the 
Nez Perce as a cough medicine.  It is boiled, and the 
juice is strained and mixed with honey. 
 
Ornamental: Horticulturally, this plant is used for cut 
flowers, beds, borders, ground cover, rock gardens, 
and prairie restoration. 
 
Wildlife: Elk, deer, and moose reportedly graze 
camas early in the spring (Craighead, Craighead, and 
Davis 1963).  Gophers eat camas and move the bulbs 
to another area where they sprout and grow the next 
year (Watson 1988).  Indian women in Oregon’s 
Umpqua Valley robbed camas bulbs from gopher 
caches (Piper 1916).  Herbivorous insects also eat 
camas leaves.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Description TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Description='General: Lily Family (Liliaceae).  Great camas or 
Leichtlin’s camas (Camassia quamash spp. quamash) 
is a liliaceous, perennial herb that grows from an 
edible bulb.  The plant can grow from 24-48 inches 
(60-120 cm) tall.  Leaves are long and narrow, grass-
like, and emerge from the base.  The inflorescence is 
a spike-like cluster borne on a leafless stem that is 
held above the leaves.  Camas flowers are creamy-
white to deep blue-violet. they have 6 tepals, 6 
stamens, and 3 stigmas.  The white form is 
considered to be native only to the Umpqua Valley of 
Oregon.  Great camas differs from common camas 
(Camassia quamash ssp. breviflora) in the following 
ways: the flowers are regular, with tepals that twist 
together after anthesis and remain over the ovary. 
anthers are dull yellow to violet. the plant is larger, 
with longer flower stalks and bigger bulbs. and there 
is a fine, waxy powder on the leaves.  The seeds are 
usually larger as well.  The fruits are barrel-shaped to 
three-angled capsules, splitting into three parts to 
release many black, angled seeds.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Distribution TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Distribution='Great camas grows in wet meadows, woods, prairies, 
moist hillsides, and streamside areas.  Camas habitat 
is often ephemeral, and dries up by late spring.  Great 
camas grows from south Vancouver Island to 
northern California, from the coast to the Cascade 
and Sierra Nevada Mountains at elevations below 
10,800 feet (3300 meters).  This sub-species does not 
extend east of the Cascades.  In British Columbia, 
great camas is restricted to wet flats, ditches, and 
moist rocky areas on southern Vancouver Island and 
the adjacent Gulf Islands. Great camas blooms in late 
April to late June. Common and great camas often 
grow together.  For current distribution, please

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Great camas can be propagated from seeds or bulbs. 
shade tolerance, moisture requirement, and preferred 
planting depth may differ among specific phenotypes.  
Great camas is frequently found in areas with soil 
moisture persisting throughout most of the growing 
season.  Its preferred habitat includes shady 
environments, such as those that occur along riparian 
zones or under moderately dense deciduous forest 
canopies in western Oregon.  However, it can be 
found in more open habitats elsewhere within its 
natural range.  The two camas sub-species are 
generally found in the same environments.  The bulbs 

Page 3
of great camas can be substantially larger in size and 
deeper in the soil than common camas, and 
sometimes grow 16 inches or more below the surface.  
Bulb depth appears limited by shallow water tables, 
anoxic conditions, or restrictive layers.  The 
occasional occurrence of a large, thick root beneath a 
bulb may aid in re-locating or re-establishing it at a 
greater depth.  Plants require irrigation or moist soil 
conditions to become established.  Great camas can 
be difficult to establish in California. 
 
' WHERE symbol='caquq';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_LivePlant_Bulb_Collections TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_LivePlant_Bulb_Collections='Great camas is readily established by transplanting 
wild or commercially grown bulbs.  Wild harvests 
should be restricted to salvage sites with appropriate 
approvals or permits.  Due to loss of wetland habitat 
throughout the United States, harvesting plants from 
the wild is rarely appropriate or legal except under 
salvage situations.  Use of bulbs or seeds from local 
nurseries or greenhouses is strongly recommended. 
 
The best time to excavate bulbs is from early summer 
through mid-fall.  This is the “quiescent” period that 
follows seed maturation, foliar senescence, and 
development of the daughter bulb.  However, 
commercial bulb harvest takes place when the leaves 
are still green and must be done carefully to avoid 
damage.  The bulb tunic or covering is very thin (De 
Hertogh and Le Nard 1993).  Given that camas 
commonly occupies sites high in silt and clay that dry 
out in summer, windows for digging are often 
narrow.  There is a brief period when soils are moist 
after flowering in the spring. the next time to harvest 
is in the fall after the rains begin.  Store the bulbs in a 
dry, dark, cool, well ventilated place in a potting 
medium such as dry peat moss, similar to 
recommendations for fall planted/spring flowering 
bulbs (such as daffodils and tulips).  Keep the bulbs 
from completely drying out and transport or store at 
63-68° F (De Hertogh, Noone, and Lutman 1990).  
Common camas reproduces vegetatively by offset 
bulblets (De Hertogh et. al. 1993).  However, much 
less than one percent of a wild population may 
produce offsets and bulbs may be stimulated to do so 
only as the result of a wound (Thoms 1989).  
 
Plant camas outdoors in the fall or early winter, when 
soils are moist enough to dig and prevailing soil 
temperatures are cool.  This is generally below 60°F.  
Fall planting allows for better root development and 
fulfillment of any chilling requirement for flowering 
(De Hertogh et. al. 1993).  Bulbs, bulblets, and 
offsets can be utilized.  However, if flowering is 
desired the following spring, bulbs must be of 
sufficient age (3-5 years old with 3-4 bulb leaves or 
scales) and size (Thoms 1989).  Bulb leaves are 
 
 
laminate concentric layers that comprise much of the 
bulb, reminiscent of an onion.  Bulbs with just two 
bulb leaves never flower, those with three routinely 
flower, and those with four almost always flower.  
Older bulbs will be found deeper in the ground, and 
bulbs which flower will probably be at least 0.6-0.8 
inch (1.5-2.0 cm) wide (Thoms 1989).  In the 
commercial bulb trade, the minimum size for export 
and thus flowering is a circumference of 2.4 inches (6 
cm) (De Hertogh and Le Nard 1993). 
 
The larger the bulb the greater the planting depth can 
be.  Planting depth ranges from 0.5-1 inches for 1-2 
year old bulblets up to 4-6 inches for mature bulbs 
(as measured to their base).  Larger bulbs (1.5 inches 
in diameter or greater) can be planted deeper (8-10 
inches) if drainage is appropriate.  Commercial 
production involves planting from October to 
November in well drained soil of pH 6-7 with at least 
2% organic matter, covering with at least 3 inches of 
soil above the bulb “nose”, applying 2 inches of 
straw mulch, fertilizing with 7-14-28 fertilizer four 
weeks after planting, and harvesting in July (De 
Hertogh, Noone and Lutman 1990).  Keep the camas 
bed damp until it gets warm.  Once plants senesce 
after flowering, stop watering so seeds form and 
bulbs cure.  Suggested spacing for flower beds and 
naturalized landscapes vary from 3-4 inches apart (8-
10 per sq. ft.) to 6-8 inches apart.  Other publications 
recommend 6-8 bulbs every 12 inches for outdoor 
gardens.  A dense “natural” stand may have 9 
plants/sq. ft. (100/sq. meter) or more (Thoms 1989).  
It may be necessary to bury bulbs with a protective 
wire mesh to prevent herbivory.  The mesh needs to 
be coarse enough to allow shoots to grow through 
(De Hertogh et. al. 1993).

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_SeedCollections TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_SeedCollections='Great camas propagates easily from seed.  It can be 
collected as soon as the pods mature (turn light 
brown) or split open to reveal the mature black seeds.  
Pods ripen from late May- July depending on 
latitude, longitude, moisture conditions, or elevation.  
Dry seeds can be stored frozen or in a cool, dry place 
prior to planting.  
 
Camas seed requires 42-100 days of cold 
temperatures (34-40°F) under moist stratification for 
maximum germination (90-100%), (Emery 1988, 
Guerrant and Raven 1995, Deno 1993, Northway 
pers. comm. 1998, Thoms 1989).  “Moist 
stratification” means placement of seeds which are 
“imbibed”, or have soaked up water, in layers of a 
moist medium at cool temperatures to allow for after-
ripening.  Germination also requires cool conditions 
and can occur in the dark (Northway pers. comm. 

Page 4
1998).  The alternative is to plant seed outdoors in the 
fall (Sept-Oct).  One-leafed, grass-like seedlings will 
emerge in February or March under suitable 
conditions.  Seedlings require moisture through the 
spring growing period to survive.  Warm 
temperatures during seedling development can be 
lethal. 
 
Suggested site preparation methods and seeding rates 
for wetland revegetation are not well known, but a 
broadcast rate of 20 live seeds/sq. ft. for both 
Camassia sub-species resulted in poor to good 
seedling counts the following spring (0-10 or more 
seedlings/sq. ft.) (Darris, pers. comm., 1999).  
Seedling success was dependent on weed 
competition, hydrology, type of disturbance, mulch, 
erosion, or other factors.  Camas seedlings were 
inhibited by dense stands of live grass such as Lolium 
multiflorum.  However, seedlings appeared to benefit 
when grown in the mulch of native grass 
(Deschampsia cespitosa), at least on well-drained, 
stable, slightly higher ground (Ibid).  In areas with 
wet, mild winters, soil scarification for shallow seed 
coverage or just constant moisture from irrigation or 
winter rains can result in good germination.  At least 
one grower sows seed directly on the soil surface in 
the fall (Robinson pers. comm. 1999).  However, 
other growers have found that a 1-2 inch covering of 
organic mulch is required during the first growing 
season to protect the tiny bulblet from exposure to 
dry soil, surface cracking, and extreme temperatures.  
Sawdust or a chemically killed dense stand of grass 
works well (Watson pers. comm. 1999).  Seeds 
deeper than 0.4-0.8 inch (1-2 cm) will not germinate 
successfully (Watson 1988).

repellents may be useful, particularly during the first 
growing season.  Consistent soil moisture is required 
every spring, but the soil can be allowed to dry out 
soon after the pods mature or the leaves senesce (dry 
up and turn brown).  Moderate soil nutrient levels are 
beneficial.  In natural settings, minor soil disturbance 
(loosening, surface scarification) adjacent to existing 
specimens may enhance natural regeneration by seed.  
Late summer field burning (where and when 
permitted) may improve stand vigor, reduce 
competition from brush and certain weeds, and aid in 
regeneration.  For optimal bulb development, avoid 
mowing or grazing more than lightly, if at all, even 
during foliar senescence.  Individual plants may live 
15-20 years. 
 
 
 
Traditional Resource Management (TRM) was often 
intensive, to the point of being considered “semi-
agricultural” by some.  According to Dr. Nancy 
Turner, TRM included the following: 
•  Ownership, demarcation, and inheritance of beds 
or patches,  
•  Clearing of rock, brush, and weedy vegetation,  
•  Harvesting bulbs after seeds were produced, 
during specific times of the year,  
•  Periodic field burning in summer after digging,  
• 
In some cases, sod removal then bulb removal 
followed by sod replacement,  
•  Digging or “cultivation” to keep the soil loose,

venustus and Calochortus superbus have overlapping 
distributions and are hard to tell apart. They also 
were not separated as two distinct species in the first 
half of the 20th century when anthropologists were 
doing their fieldwork among tribes.  Therefore, it is 
highly likely that tribes dug the bulbs of populations 
of both species.  The large showy flowers of 
Calochortus venustus range from white, yellow, 
purple, to dark red, and have a red-brown eyespot 
above the gland on the inside of each petal.  
Sometimes there is a paler blotch above the first.  The 
base of the plant is bulblet-bearing.  The erect stems 
are branched and 1 to 6-flowered.  The linear leaves 
are basal and 1-2 dm long.  The fruit is erect, 5-6 cm, 
linear and angled. 
 
The main identifying features that distinguish 
Calochortus superbus from Calochortus venustus is 
the nectary.  On Calochortus venustus it is square, 
while on Calochortus superbus it is crescent or 
chevron-shaped.  Another difference is that the petals 
on Calochortus venustus sometimes have a second 
distal, paler spot, while with Calochortus superbus 
the petal spot is always one, generally in the yellow 
zone.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Description='General: Legume Family (Fabaceae).  Eastern redbud 
is a native, perennial, deciduous tree or shrub.  The 
plants may vary in form from dense and round (to 6 
m tall) when grown in sun, to an open, taller form (to 
12 m tall) when grown in the shade.  The trees 
produce hundreds of small pink pea flowers in the 
very early spring, even before other trees have leafed 
out.  The bright magenta-pink to lilac flowers, appear 
in small clusters, primarily on older stems.  The 
flowers are irregular, 9 to 12 cm long, with ten 
stamens.  The unique, broadly heart-shaped leaves 
are nearly circular (5 to 10 cm), with a long, slender 
petiole.  The leaves are alternate and have 5 to 9 
prominent veins that radiate palmately from the base.  
New leaves are a light green that darken with age and 
finally turn yellow in the fall.  The seeds are 
contained in a flat, thin pod (4 to 10 cm long), which 
turns from green to brown. 
 
Distribution: Eastern redbud is native to the eastern 
and south-central United States, southward to Texas.  
For current distribution, please consult the Plant 
Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
site. 
 
Habitat: Eastern redbud occurs in the forest 
understory in moist rich woods, along the banks of 
streams, in ravines, on bluffs, in open rocky woods, 
and abandoned farmlands.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Eastern redbud is widely cultivated as an ornamental 
because of the plants showy springtime flowers and 
beautiful heart-shaped leaves.  The plants are 
graceful with arching branches that look lovely as a 
specimen tree, in groupings, and in shrub borders.  
The plants do well in soils of moderate to low 
fertility and are very drought resistant.  The seeds 
have very hard seed coats that require both chilling 
and scarification for germination, unless planted in 
the fall.  Cuttings are difficult to root.  Mature plants 
do not transplant well so buy young plants that are 
balled-and-burlapped or container grown.  Transplant 
the plants in the spring or fall, in well-drained soils in 
sun to part shade.  Water the plants regularly until 
established.

American tribes that used eastern redbud for various 
purposes.  The bark was made into a tea to treat 
whooping cough.  Taking cold infusions of the roots 
and inner bark treated fevers and congestion.  An 
infusion of the bark was used to treat vomiting and 
fever.  During winters, the plants were used for 
firewood.  Because it is one of the first plants to 
flower in the spring, the blossoming branches were 
brought into the homes to “drive winter out.”  
Children were “fond of eating the blossoms” of 
eastern redbud.   
 
Wildlife/Livestock: Many birds, including bobwhite 
quails, eat the seeds.  White-tailed deer are among the 
animals that browse the foliage.  Honeybees visit the 
blossoms.  Livestock will browse on Eastern redbud.

Due to its fast-growing nature and nitrogen-fixing 
capabilities, buckbrush is a great pioneer species for new 
landscapes (Las Pilitas Nursery, 2011). It is also a 
valuable shrub species for pollinator hedgerows, and 
attracts many bees with its fragrant flowers in the early 
spring. There are several cultivars of Ceanothus cuneatus 
available at local nurseries. 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
Description 
General: Buckthorn family (Rhamnaceae).  California 
buckbrush is an erect, perennial, evergreen shrub within 
the California lilac (Ceanothus) genus.  The species 
ranges in size from 3 to 12 feet tall.  As with other 
California lilac species, buckbrush shrubs are distinct 
from other woody chaparral plants with their unique 
pattern of angular, rigid branchlets of unequal sizes.  The 
twigs are round and gray colored and do not have hairs or 
spines.  The evergreen leaves on this species are in an 
opposite arrangement, generally 0.25 - 0.5 in long.  The 
leaves are generally smooth and entire, sometimes with a 
toothed margin near the apex.  The inflorescence, 
generally less than 1 inch, is displayed as a raceme with 
several umbellate clusters, each containing many fragrant 
flowers.  The flowering period of this species is between 
March and May and the flower colors ranges from white 
to several shades of blue and lavender.  The fruits are 0.25 
- 0.5 in long and have 3 distinct horns near the top 
without crests or ridges.  Each fruit capsule contains two 
to three seeds (McMinn, 1939. Hickman, 1993).  
Ethnobotany 
As one of the dominant species in the chaparral 
ecosystem, this shrub has been utilized by California 
Native Americans for centuries.  
Buckbrush shrubs contain a significant amount of woody 
material and several California tribes including the 
Kawaiisu and the Miwok used this species for firewood 
(Zigmond, 1981. Merriam, 1967).  The twigs were also 
collected for a variety of hunting and fishing purposes. 
The Kawaiisu used the straight twigs of this shrub as the 
foreshafts for two-piece arrows.  The arrows were created 
by stripping and sharpening the Ceanothus twigs and 
fitting them inside sections of hollow Carrizo grass of 
“cane” (Zigmond, 1981).  Indians of Mendocino used 
buckbrush woody material to create fish dams (Chestnut, 
1902).

Uses 
Wildlife: Deer will forage on the leaves, shoots and 
berries of buckbrush, preferring the tender young 
seedlings to the mature plants. Additionally, small rodents 
and birds including the quail and mourning dove feed on 
the seeds (League, 2005). Buckbrush is also an important 
cover species for wildlife, due to its size and abundance 
of branchlets.  
 Buckbrush is also an important species for pollinators 
such as bees, butterflies and hummingbirds.   
Landscaping: Along with other native Ceanothus species, 
Ceanothus cuneatus is an aesthetically pleasing shrub 
commonly integrated in the outdoor landscape of homes,

Buckbrush was also used for traditional Native American 
tools. Seed beaters were constructed using the rigid 
woody material of the shrub.  Consisting of a basket with 
a handle, the seed beaters were used to “thrust over the 
spike or inflorescence of a grass of wildflower to knock 
off the grains and seeds into a burden basket” (Anderson, 
2005).  The Paiute and Miwok tribes used the rigid 
buckbrush wood to create digging sticks (Steward, 1933).  
Barrett and Gifford (1933) describe this tool as a three to 
four foot long stick that was hacked off with a sharp 
stone, scraped with flint, and hardened by fire.  The tool 
was held as a staff and thrust into the ground as a digging 
device.  Sharpened buckbrush twigs were also utilized by 
the Pit River tribe to create slender needles used in the 
piercing of earlobes of young girls (Merriam, 1967).  
Similarly, the Tubatulabal used the sharpened twigs as a 
skewer for roasted pinyon nuts (Voegelin, 1938).   
To this day, Ceanothus cuneatus is an extremely valuable 
species for basketry.  Several characteristics of buckbrush 
including its color, length and strength make it an ideal 
species for this craft.  The young shoots in particular are 
highly valued for basketry. The Miwok and Mono Indians 
historically manipulated stands of buckbrush by pruning 
and coppicing to induce rapid elongation of young growth 
and burning to encourage new seedlings (Anderson, 1991, 
2005).  
 
 Buckbrush branches are often used in the construction of 
burden baskets.  According to Barrett and Gifford (1933), 
the burden baskets used by the Miwok Indians were 
reinforced by using a hoop made of Ceanothus cuneatus 
wood, placed midway down inside the basket.  Buckbrush 
branches were also used by the Mono for the hood of 
cradleboards and the rims of winnowers and seed beaters 
(Anderson, 2005). The Sierra Miwok made shallow 
openwork scoop baskets of buckbrush called cham-ah, 
used for drying green acorns, and in later times for drying 
domesticated fruits such as peaches and figs. the 
foundation of some Miwok coiled baskets used for acorn 
mush are made of young buckbrush shoots (Merriam, 
1967). 
Distribution:   
Ceanothus cuneatus is widely distributed through 
California, Oregon and northern Baja California, Mexico, 
generally at elevations less than 6000 ft.  For current 
distribution, please consult the Plant Profile page for this 
species on the PLANTS Web site. 
Habitat:   
Buckbrush is one of the primary shrub species in the 
chaparral ecosystem.  It is commonly found on dry, rocky 
slopes and ridges along with associated shrub species 
including chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum) and 
whiteleaf manzanita (Arctostaphylos viscida) (Baker, 
1982).  In some places, Ceanothus cuneatus outcompetes 
other shrub species to form dense, impenetrable thickets 
 
(McMinn, 1939).  These ecosystems are known as 
ceanothus chaparral vegetation type.  
 
Ceanothus cuneatus is adapted to serpentine soils, and 
can therefore serve as a good indicator species for field 
identification of serpentine soils in California and Oregon 
(Kruckeberg, 1984).  It should be noted however, that this 
species is more commonly found on non-serpentine soils 
of sandstone origins (Safford and Harrison, 2004). 
 
Buckbrush is also an important shrub species in the 
montane ecosystem where it often grows as an understory 
species in pine forests and oak woodland habitats. In the 
coastal sage scrub habitat type, buckbrush is present in 
areas in or near low elevation coastal aspects, along with 
the dominant species, California sagebrush (Artemisia 
californica).  Buckbrush is also found in inland dune 
habitats in small populations. (League, 2005).   
Adaptation 
Ceanothus cuneatus is adapted to the annual summer 
drought in the Mediterranean climate zone.  In a two year 
study comparing the phenology of chaparral shrubs, it 
was found that buckbrush undergoes branch elongation, 
leaf initiation and flowering in late winter and early 
spring before the onset of annual drought (Baker, 1982). 
 
Buckbrush is also well adapted to chaparral fires, and is 
widely considered to be a “fire recruiter” species. High 
temperatures are necessary to melt and crack the cuticle 
of buried seeds, facilitating high germination rates after 
fire (League, 2005).  McMinn (1939) noted that dense 
colonies of this plant can be formed within a few years 
after a major fire disturbance.   
Establishment 
The germination and establishment of Ceanothus 
cuneatus in its natural habitat is highly correlated with 
fire regime.  Germination rates in the spring following fire 
disturbance are generally quite high, but seedling survival 
varies according to soil moisture (Sweeney, 1956).  Since 
establishment occurs after fire, buckbrush typically forms 
even-aged stands (Keeley, 1982).   
Management 
Buckbrush stand maintenance is most successful with fire 
intervals of 30-100 years (Minnich, 1999. Paysen et al., 
2000).  This fire regime allows for larger quantities of 
seeds to accumulate in the seed bank.  In the mid-
twentieth century, it was believed that Native American 
burning practices led to the increase of several chaparral 
species, including Ceanothus cuneatus in oak woodlands 
(Biswell, 1956).

Environmental Concerns 
There are no known environmental concerns associated 
with buckbrush. 
Seeds and Plant Production 
Ceanothus cuneatus fruits are usually ripe in late spring.  
When the seeds are ripe, the mature capsule bursts open 
with considerable force and the seeds can fall up to 35 
feet from the plant (Biswell and Gilman, 1961).  This 
seed-ejecting mechanism, while beneficial for the plant, 
can make seed collecting quite challenging.  One 
technique for seed collection is to tie cloth bags over 
clusters of green seed pods (Conard and Reed, 2003).  
Another method is to cut seedpod clusters before the 
capsules have split. however you must insure the seeds 
are mature, since prematurely collected seeds will not 
germinate successfully (Emery, 1988). 
Seed propagation is most successful using a combination 
of scarification and stratification techniques.  Seeds can 
be scarified with fire, or by using a hydrochloric acid  
mixture.  Seeds should then be refrigerated and stored in 
sealed containers for about two to three weeks.  In a 
greenhouse environment, germination of Ceanothus 
cuneatus was most successful when seeds were planted at 
depths of 0.5 to 1 inch (Adams, 1962. Belcher, 1985).  
Plants can also be propagated from semi-hard cuttings in 
the summer, or from root cuttings in the late fall to early 
winter.   
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
Buckbrush container stock is readily available through 
most nurseries within its range. Contact your local 
Natural Resources Conservation Service (formerly Soil 
Conservation Service) office for more information.  
 Sierra Snow  is a cultivar with showy, white flowers that 
grows2-3 meters tall and 2.5 meters wide.  It prefers full 
to partial sun and does well in plant hardiness zones 8, 9, 
10 and 11.  This cultivar thrives in dry, hot climates, is 
drought-tolerant and low maintenance, but is susceptible 
to aphids, root rot, and whiteflies (Sunny Gardens, 2011). 
‘Sierra Mt. Lilac’ is another cultivar with fragrant blue 
flowers. It typically grows into a large evergreen bush 
(about 8 feet) with a showy inflorescence during the 
spring. Due to its fast-growing nature and nitrogen fixing 
capabilities, this cultivar is commonly planted as a 
companion to slow-growing species such as oaks, 
coffeeberry and toyon (Las Pilitas Nursery, 2011). 
‘Snow Ball’ is a cultivar of Ceanothus cuneatus var. 
rigidus, otherwise known as Monterey ceanothus. It 
named for its showy white flowers which bloom in the 
early spring. This cultivar grows best in the coastal range 
climate, since it is endemic to this area and can be used as 
a scale ground cover species (Las Pilitas Nursery, 2011).

The upper leaf surface is almost smooth.  The lower 
leaf surface has long, soft, unmated hairs.  The stalk of 
the inflorescence is 1-2 cm long and is racemose with 
flowers maturing from the bottom upwards.  The 
flowers are white and have 5 petals (1.5 mm long), 5 
stamens, and 3 lobed ovaries.  The fruits or capsules 
are 3-4.5 mm wide and open at maturity to release the 
seeds.  The seeds are 2 mm long, brownish in color, 
and have a glossy surface.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_='Uses 
Ethnobotanic: Western redbud is highly valued by 
Native American basket weavers in California for 
their young, wine-red branches, harvested in the fall 
and used in the warp, weft, and designs of baskets.  If 
the branches are harvested in the spring when the 
bark slips, the white inner sapwood may also be used 
as the weft or lacing in baskets. 
 
Other: Uses include the following: landscaping, 
furniture, browsing, and stream stabilization. Western 
redbud is a good soil stabilizer along streams, and 
can withstand periodic flooding.  The flowers provide 
nectar to bees and the young shoots, leaves, and 
seedpods are browsed by goats, and too a limited 
extent by deer, sheep, and cattle.  The browse rating 
though for sheep and cattle is poor.  Horticulturists 
have planted redbud in informal and formal gardens 
and landscapes since 1886 and it has been called one 
of California s most attractive flowering shrubs in 
gardeners  manuals and horticultural guides.

February through April, any one shrub will remain in 
flower only about two weeks.  In autumn the

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Distribution='For current distribution, please consult the Plant 
Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
site.  Native to California, Arizona, and Utah, redbud 
is found in at least five plant communities including 
oak woodland, chaparral, mixed conifer forest, 
riparian woodland, and closed cone forest. 
 
' WHERE symbol='ceor9';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Adaptation: It grows at elevations of 4,000 ft. or less, 
in canyons and on rather steep slopes, in gravely, and 
rocky soils along streams, where it is never flooded.  
It also grows in the bottom of ephemeral streambeds 
in little pockets, benches, or crannies of boulder 
outcroppings.  The plant is drought tolerant, sun-
loving, and grows in a wide variety of soils, but it is 
usually found in rather harsh environments with 
course, nutrient-poor soils that are well-drained.  It 
grows mostly singly, but sometimes, in sheltered 
situations, in shrubby clumps.  
 
If possible, gather the seed from local sources, to 
maintain genetic diversity of redbud.  The seedpods 
can be collected in the fall of the year from 
September to November from redbud branches.  
Redbud seeds are adapted for prolonged periods of 
dryness and cold and they require special 
pretreatment to germinate, owing to an impervious 
seed coat plus a dormant embryo. One method is to 
place the seeds into a container and pour boiling 
water over them and let the seeds soak overnight. 
They can then be covered with damp peat moss and 
refrigerated for two months or they can be planted 
right away.  The germination of redbud seed in the 
wild is favored by fire, which cracks the seed coat 
and generates the heat needed to stimulate 
germination. 
 
Plant the treated seed in the fall in flats, spacing the 
seeds approximately one to two inches apart.  Use a 
slow-release fertilizer in the planting mix.  Cover 
with about a quarter-inch of soil (approximately 3 to 
4 times the width of the seed).  To reduce the 
possibility of damping off, keep the flats outdoors in 
a protected area with partial shade and little wind.  
Water the flats through the winter and the let the 
plants grow one full year before planting them out.  
The seedlings will be about three inches to one foot 
tall by the following fall.   Plant the seedlings in a 
sunny location with good drainage.  If gophers are a 
problem, plant redbud seedlings in cages.  Watering 
is not necessary until the following summer, in a 
normal rainfall year.  Give the young plants summer 
 
 
water for the first three years in the ground.  This 
amounts to once every two weeks in a hot climate 
and less in a coastal climate. Do not over water, as 
redbud will not tolerate summer water in the root 
crown area (at the soil level) and will suffer crown 
rot (Phytophthora sp.) if over-watered.  When leaves 
first emerge in the spring, use liquid fertilizer to 
boost growth.   
 
' WHERE symbol='ceor9';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='Pruning: Periodic pruning of redbud, after it has 
reached the minimum age of 5 years, can be 
accomplished to remove dead or dying branches that 
might harbor diseases or insects.  Pruning should take 
place in the fall, winter, or early spring, after leaf 
drop and during the dormant period.  Contemporary 
Native American weavers practice two types of 
pruning.  One technique is coppicing where the 
whole plant is cut to within several inches of the 
ground. Redbud vigorously resprouts from the 
coppice stool, sending up young straight shoots with 
a beautiful red pigment.  This can bring added color 
to gardens and also these shoots are highly valued for 
basket weaving.  Coppicing, however, should only be 
done on mature shrubs--at least a decade old.  
Flowering will be lost, until the young sprouts are 
two to three years old and shed the red pigment and 
form true bark.  The other technique is selective 
pruning within the canopy to direct the growth of the 
plant.  This pruning, leaves some older flowering 
branches, important for bees and butterflies.   
 
Burning: Before Euro-American settlement of 
California, Native Americans conducted purposeful 
burning of hillsides in the fall of the year, after 
redbud has shed its leaves, to encourage the growth 
of young, straight shoots used extensively in 
basketry.  Redbud also resprouts vigorously after 
fires.   
 
A pathogen that infects redbud leaves is Alternaria 
sp. while Botrytis sp. is a gray mold that causes 
foliage or flower blight.  Two fungi that cause root 
rot in redbud include Fusarium solani and 
Verticillium dahliae.  A fungus that infects old 
seedpods is Didymella leguminis-cytisis.  Most of 
these diseases will debilitate, but not kill redbud.  
Fire is an effective tool to use to eliminate the above-
ground pathogens inhabiting redbud.

many California Indian tribes.  The bulb was 
gathered historically in large quantities with a 
digging stick and it is still harvested today by various 
cultural groups.  Traditionally the bulbs were highly 
valued for soap for washing the body, hair, baskets, 
and utensils among the Luiseno, Pomo, Miwok, 
Yuki, Western Mono, Karuk, Wiyot, Western Mono, 
Tubatulabal, Foothill Yokuts, Cahuilla, and most

fish poison--the bulb being mashed and placed into 
quiet pools of water to cause fish to become 
immobilized and float to the water surface. The bulb 
contains saponin--which may contribute to its 
effectiveness as a soap and fish poison. 
 
If the bulb is boiled or roasted, and mashed, the paste 
is a good adhesive and is used as a glue for soaproot 
brush handles, and attaching feathers to arrows. The 
brushes are made by using the coarse &quot.horsehair-like&quot.

If establishing the plants by seed, plant them in the 
fall by October 1st and place the seeds in a deep 1-
gallon container (six inches deep).  Water the 
container thoroughly and let it drain.  Plant the seed 
the next day.  Scatter the seed on top of sandy soil.  
Sprinkle a light layer of soil over the top of the seeds.  
Place one-quarter inch gravel on top of this soil.  Set 
the pots outside and let the rains come.  If it is a 
drought year, supplement with hand watering.  The 
containers should get early morning and late 
afternoon sun, but shade in the middle of the day.  
After the plants are a year-old during dormancy, 
divide them to give them more space.  Plant them two 
inches or more apart.  At the end of the second year, 
in the summer or fall, plant them out.

The young leaves are cooked and used for human

(Plucknett and White 1979).  These young leaves are 
boiled or covered with coconut cream, wrapped in 
banana or breadfruit leaves and cooked on hot stones 
(Kubo 1970).   
 
The corms are generally cooked by baking, boiling or 
baking in the traditional ovens.

boiled and eaten by women experiencing a difficult 
childbirth.  Many tribes believed the early morning 
dew that collected in the leaf was excellent medicinal 
eyewash.  Women with dysmenorrheal were made to 
sit on taro leaves.  Juice of the petioles is styptic and 
was used to arrest arterial hemorrhage.  Taro was 
used in earache and as an external stimulant and 
rubefacient.  Taro was used as a laxative in cases of 
hemorrhoids.  Some tribes use taro as an antidote to 
the stings of wasps and other biting or stinging 
insects.  Heated tubers were applied to painful parts 
in rheumatism.  Honey mixed with tuber ash was 
used as a cure for apthae in the mouth.   
 
In Hawaii, the raw juice mixed with sugar was taken 
orally to reduce fever.  Taro was used by Hawaiians 
to treat illness ranging from constipation to 
tuberculosis.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Description TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Description='Arum Family (Araceae).  Taro is an ancient crop 
grown throughout the tropic and subtropics.  Taro is 
believed to have originated in South East Asia 
including India and Malaysia.  Spencer (1966) stated 
that taro and other edible arioida were distributed 
from east India to Formosa and the Solomon Islands.  
Taro seeds were dispersed by birds, and palm civets 
.(Panoff, 1972, Hambali, 1979).  
 
Taro, sometimes called the &quot.potato of the tropics,&quot. or 
&quot.elephant ears&quot. is a wetland herbaceous perennial 
with huge “elephant ear” like leaves.  It produces 
heart shaped leaves 2-3  long and 1-2  across on 3  
long petioles that all emanate from an upright 
tuberous rootstock, called a corm.  The petioles are 
thick, succulent, and often purplish.  The leaf petiole 
attaches near the center of the leaf.  The corm is 
 
 
shaped like a top with rough ridges, lumps and 
spindly roots, and usually weighs around 1-2 pounds, 
but can weigh eight pounds.  The skin is brown with 
white or pink flesh.  Taros can produce smaller tubers 
or &quot.cormels&quot. which grow off the sides of the main 
corm.  Under ideal growing conditions, a single taro 
plant can get 8  tall with an 8’canopy spread. 
 
There are more than 200 cultivars of taro, selected for 
their edible corms or cormels, or their tropical 
looking ornamental foliage.  These cultivars fall into 
two main groups: wetland taros, the source of the 
Polynesian food poi, which is made from the main 
corm. and upland taros, which produce numerous 
eddos that are used much like potatoes for cooking 
and in processing. 
 
Taro, although grown commercially in many areas of 
the Pacific Basin, for the most part, is a backyard 
crop planted usually in small plots near the house.  
Because taro has a high water requirement and a long 
growing season it can only grow where water is 
available most of the year.  Its ability to grow in 
waterlogged conditions allows for the utilization of 
hydromorphic soils which are unsuitable for other 
crops (Onwueme, I.C. 1985)  
 
Taro and other aroid food crops have traditionally 
been a source of food energy for Pacific Islanders.  
Taro is a plant that must be tilled and watered if it is 
to grow and perform.  The roots and suckers of many 
varieties of taro were carried along the trade routes of 
the world.  The taro plant has a triple value in that the 
stem may be used as salads, the tubers provide easily 
digested starch, with the leaves are used as a green 
vegetable.  The leaves are also used as wrapping for 
food, as plates, and as an umbrella in a rainstorm.  
Cyrtosperma (giant taro) provides for a reserve food 
crop, which grows well in low-lying areas and saline 
swamps.  
 
Distribution: For current U.S. distribution, please 
consult the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Adaptation. Taro can grow in a wide range of soil 
from upland or dry land soils that are well drained, 
non-flooded soils to soils that are in high rainfall 
areas or saturated for prolonged periods of time.  
Taro can grow in areas that only it and rice can grow 
because of standing water during the growing season.  
The upland taro is usually grown on hillsides in soil 
that is marginal in fertility and productivity.  Soils in 
these areas are usually well drained and friable.  
While lowland or wetland taro is usually planted in 

Page 3
low-lying areas where there is an abundant supply of 
water.  The soils in these areas are normally alluvial 
and of high native fertility and production.  
 
Taro can grow in areas ranging from sea level to 
1,800 m in elevation under daily average temperature 
of 21-27°C and rainfall of 250 cm annually.  Taro is 
usually planted at wide spacing of 1m x 1m at a 
density of 10,000 plants/ha in dry areas and at 
spacing as close as 45cm x 45cm or approximately 
49,000 plants/ha in wetland areas.  
 
' WHERE symbol='coes';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Plantingmaterial TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Plantingmaterial='Taro is usually the first crop planted after the 
clearance of a forest fallow because the soil if very 
fertile.  However after repeated use the soil becomes 
less productive and will require organic or inorganic 
fertilizer to maintain high yields.  If commercial 
fertilizer is used be sure not to place the fertilizer in 
the bottom of the hole with the sucker because the 
fertilizer will destroy the young sucker.  
 
In the South Pacific, “tiapuli” or setts are prepared 
from the suckers or main plant.  The tiapuli consist of 
the cormels with the petioles and are the main 
material used of propagating taro.  Small tiapuli used 
for planting can have a considerable effect on yield if 
weeding is delayed during early establishment.  
Large size planting material grows more vigorously, 
giving full ground cover earlier and hence providing 
better weed control.  Planting depth should be in a 
furrow or hole about 30 cm deep.  Planting should be 
timed to rainfall with lower rainfall areas planted 
during the early part of the rainy season for best 
survival and production.  In areas with well-
distributed rainfall or if one is using irrigation the 
effect of planting dates is less important because 
planting can occur throughout the year.  Most of the 
planting and production operation is manual in small 
communities except for occasional chemical weed 
control.  
 
In Hawaii, the planting material is called huli.  Huli 
are the cormels ( oha or keiki) that have been 
trimmed. When the kalo plant is harvested, the keiki 
are cut off from the harvested makua plant and their 
leaves and corms are cut off, leaving only about a 
quarter of an inch attached to the stem. These huli are 
then left in a cool, dry place for a day or two to allow 
the cut to heal before they are planted again. The huli 
should be kept moist so that they don’t dry out but 
should not be left in standing water otherwise they 
will rot. After a day or so, the huli will be ready for 
planting. 
Wet kalo is grown in the lowlands and on valley 
floors in man made terraces (Lo i) that are irrigated 
 
 
by diverted mountain streams. The huli may be 
planted in rows or in mounds in the lo i. They will 
grow to maturity in 9-14 months, depending on the 
variety. Wet kalo must have cold water running 
through it’s lo i because warm, standing water will 
cause the kalo to rot.

Weeding must be preformed during the first six 
months after planting.  If weeding is not done on a 
regular basis during the first six months, taro 
production can be reduced by as much as 50 to 85 
percent.  Weeding after six months is usually not 
important because the taro crop forms full ground 
cover therefore preventing young weeds from 
growing.  Unwanted vegetation can be controlled 
using mechanical means or through the use of 
approved herbicides.  
 
The taro must be weeded and mulched several times 
during the crop’s growth. Commercial fertilizers are 
also used to produce larger plants. 
 
When the crop is ready to be harvested, the taro are 
pulled out of the ground and the corms cut off. The 
new planting material will also be prepared at this 
time. If the taro is being grown for the leaves, the 
leaves should be picked about two months after 
planting when the leaves are large but still young. If 
the taro is being grown for the corms, then they 
should be harvested when the corms reach maturity. 
Taro that is being grown for the corms should not be 
used for leaves because picking the leaves while the 
corm is developing will damage the corm.

the warmer upland sites with good solar radiation 
will mature in about 12 months.  Most of the taro 
grown in the lowlands or wetland areas is harvested

and loosened from the soil and rotated in a circular 
fashion to cut and sever the roots.  Mature taro leaves

smoking the sacred pipe (Moerman 1986).  The 
leaves and/or inner bark of redosier dogwood are also 
used as a smoking mixture by the Okanagan-Colville,  
 
the Flathead, the Kootenay, and the Blackfeet peoples 
in the western United States and Canada (Hellson 
1974, Hart 1976, Turner 1978, Turner et al. 1980, 
Johnston 1987).  The Navaho-Kayentaf and Navaho-
Ramah used the plant ceremonially as a Mountain-
top-way emetic (Moerman 1986).  An infusion of 
redosier dogwood bark was used as an anti-diarrheal 
by the Chippewa and the Potawatomi, an antidote for 
weak kidneys by the Shuswap, and a pediatric aid for 
children who wet the bed by the Shuswap.  The 
Chippewa used an infusion of the bark for eruptions 
caused by poison ivy.  The Chippewa and the 
Micmac used a decoction of redosier dogwood root 
for sore eyes and catarrh.  The Okanagan and the 
Thompson Indians took a decoction of the leaves.  
Other remedies treated by redosier dogwood included 
headaches, sore throats, a wash for ulcers, a substitute 
for “larb”, and a decoction of bark was taken as an 
antidote for weakness. 
 
The Maidu of Northern California used redosier 
dogwood as a tonic, a laxative, emetic, and cathartic 
(Strike 1994).  Maidu women took a dogwood 
decoction after childbirth. 
 
The Indians of the Missouri region (Densmore 1974) 
ate the fruits.  The berries are known to be tart and 
bitter, but were nonetheless eaten by all of the 
southern Interior peoples of British Columbia, 
including the Nlaka’pamux, Lillooet, Okanagan-
Colville, Shuswap, Kootenay, Blackfeet, and the 
Flathead of Alberta and Montana (Kuhnlein and 
Turner 1991).  The fruits were gathered from August 
to October and eaten fresh, a few at a time, or, more 
commonly, were pounded and mixed with other 
fruits, such as chokecherries (Prunus virginiana) or 
Saskatoons (Amelanchier almifolia).  Some people 
mashed the berries and dried them in cakes. others 
dried and stored them.  Eating a few raw fruits was 
considered to be a good tonic among the 
Nlaka’pamux and the Okanagan-Colville, who ate 
them raw as a kind of “relish” (Turner 1978. Turner 
et al. 1990).   
 
Redosier dogwood is used for basketweaving.  
Sometimes called red willow, both Salix species and 
Cornus sericea are used interchangeably.

the sacred pipe ceremony.  Dreamcatchers, 
originating with the Potawotami, are made with the

ate the white, sour berries, while others used the 
branches for arrow-making, stakes, or other tools.  In 
California, peeled twigs were used as toothbrushes 
for their whitening effect on teeth (Strike 1994).  
Bows and arrows were made from Cornus shoots.  
The inner bark is used for tanning or drying animal 
hides.

element.  Indian people from the mid-Columbia 
River used redosier dogwood to make “ribbons” for 
basket decorations (Schlick 1994).  If gathered in the 
early spring, the bark will retain its deep red color 
when dried and could be mistaken for cherry.  The 
Hidatsa, Arikara, and Mandan made twill plaited 
burden baskets with two-toned dark and light 
designs. these baskets were made of willow (Salix 
nigra), redosier dogwood, and boxelder (Acer 
negundo) splints (Turnbaugh et al. 1986, Hart 1976).  
Willow and redosier dogwood were used by the 
Cheyenne, Arapaho, Kiowa, Pawnee, and Teton 
Sioux to make a coarsely coiled gambling basket for 
dice. 
 
The Ojibwa and the Chippewa used redosier 
dogwood bark as a dye.  The inner bark was mixed 
with other plants or minerals and used to make a red 
dye, a light red dye, a black dye, and an ecru or 
“khaki” colored dye (Densmore 1974).  
 
Wildlife: The fleshy fruits of dogwoods are very 
valuable to wildlife, particularly in the Northeast 
(Martin et al. 1951).  The fruit ripens in late summer, 
and besides being available through the fall, some of 
the berries may persist on the plants into the winter 
months.  Wildlife browse the twigs, foliage, and 
fruits.  Birds known to eat the fruit include: wood 
ducks, eastern bluebirds, cardinals, catbirds, long-
tailed chats, crows, purple finches, yellow-shafted 
flickers, crested flycatchers, grosbeaks, kingbirds, 
American magpies, mockingbirds, crested mynah 
birds, orioles, robins, yellow-bellied sapsuckers, 
European starlings, tree swallows, scarlet tanagers, 
brown thrashers, thrushes, vireos, pine warblers, 
cedar waxwings, and woodpeckers.  Game birds who 
eat both the fruits and buds include grouse, ring-
necked pheasants, band-tailed pigeons, greater prairie 
chickens, bobwhite quail, and wild turkeys.  The 
shrubs provide excellent nesting habitat for 
songbirds.  Mammals that eat the fruit and foliage 
include black bear, beaver, mountain beaver, 
cottontail rabbits, raccoons, eastern skunks, squirrels, 
chipmunks, mice, and rats.  Deer, elk, Mountain goat, 
and moose browse the twigs and foliage. 
 
Landscaping &amp. ornamental: Redosier dogwood is 
often planted as an ornamental, both to beautify the 
landscape and to attract birds.  Dogwood is often 
used for landscaping and as a secondary plant in 
windbreaks.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Description='General: Dogwood Family (Cornaceae).  Redosier 
dogwood is a woody deciduous shrub generally 1.4-6 
m (4.6-20 ft) tall.  The bark and twigs are reddish to 
purple and fairly smooth from autumn to late spring. 
after the leaves have fallen, the deep burgundy 
branches add color to the winter landscape.  The 
bark, twigs, and leaves are bright green in spring 
through summer.  The simple, opposite leaves are 5-
10 cm (2-4 in) long, dark green above and hairy and 
lighter-colored below, with smooth margins, rounded 
bases, pointed tips, and falsely parallel veins. 
Flowering occurs from June to August.  The 
inflorescence is a cyme, with 2-3 mm (0.08-0.12 in) 
white to cream-colored flowers.  The white berries 
are smooth on the faces, furrowed on the sides.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_ TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_='Redosier dogwood grows in soils that are 
saturated for at least a portion of the growing season.  
Redosier dogwood is common on the edges of lakes, 
ponds, within wetlands, and along streams.  Not as 
tolerant of long-term root saturation as are some 
other shrubs, dogwood seems to prefer wetland 
margins where soils are nitrogen-rich, saturated, and 
shallowly inundated in the spring, and may be 
completely dry by late summer.  It is tolerant of 
fluctuating water tables.  The “osier” in redosier 
dogwood is derived from French, meaning “willow-
like”. it is often called red willow because of its red 
stems. 
 
Propagation from cuttings: Redosier dogwood can be 
started easily by division, french layering, and 
hardwood cuttings.  To propagate suckers by 
division: 
•  Lift a root with suckers on it without disturbing 
the parent plant.  Check that there are fibrous 
roots at the base of the suckers. 
•  Remove the suckering roots by cutting it off 
close to the parent plant.  Firm the soil around 
the parent plant. 
•  Cut the main root back to the fibrous roots, then 
divide the suckers so that each has its own roots.  
Cut back the top-growth by about half. 

Page 3
•  Treat each sucker or hardwood cutting at the 
base with IBA at 20,000 ppm liquid formulation 
to promote rooting.  Alternatively, treatment 
with 2 percent IBA talc. this will promote 
rooting on both suckers and stem cuttings. 
•  Replant the suckers in open ground in prepared 
holes with good potting soil.  Firm the soil 
around the suckers and water. 
•  Before growth starts in the spring, lift the plant.  
Break the clump into sections, retaining those 
with vigorous shoots and well-developed roots. 
•  Prune any damaged roots, and cut back the top-
growth by one-third to a half to reduce water 
loss.  Replant the divisions in the open and water 
in dry weather. 
•  Ultimately, simply lift a suckering root, sever it 
from the parent plant, and then replant it in the 
open. 
 
To ensure survival of cuttings or suckers through the 
following winter in cold climates, the potted cuttings 
should be kept in heated cold frames or poly-houses 
to hold the temperature between 0-7°C (32-45°F).  
Rooted cuttings that had shoot growth in the fall, but 
were not given nitrogen, had the best over-winter 
survival in a cold frame with microfoam. 
 
French layering: Layering is a method where a stem 
is encouraged to develop roots before being removed 
from the parent plant. 
• 
In spring, plant a rooted layer or young plant, 
label it, and grow it for a season.  Then, in the 
dormant season, cut back the stem to within 3 
inches (8 cm) of the ground.  
In the following spring, apply a balanced 
fertilizer at the rate of 2-4-oz/sq yd (60-110 g/sq 
m).  Space the stems evenly again. dropping each 
into a 2-inch (5-cm) deep trench.  Peg down each 
stem and cover with soil, leaving the shoot tips 
exposed.  Hill up all but 2-3 inches (5-8 cm) of 
the new shoots as they develop, until the mound 
is 6 inches (15 cm) high.  Water as needed. 
• 
•  After leaf fall, carefully fork away the soil from 
around the new shoots until the stems that were 
laid horizontally are exposed.  Cut these flush 
with the basal area of the stems.  Then cut the 
stems to separate the rooted sections.  Pot these 
or plant them out in the open garden, and label 
them.  The same redosier dogwood basal area 
may be used to propagate further layers. 
 
Propagation by seed: Redosier dogwood is 
established easily from seed.  The best germination is 
obtained if the seeds are gathered as soon as the fruit 
starts to color or ripen, from August to October.  If 
 
 
the seeds are allowed to dry out, it is best to remove 
seeds from the fruit and soak in water.  
 
The best results are obtained from fall sowing of 
freshly harvested seeds.  Fruits collected too late to 
sow in the fall should be stored, pre-chilled until the 
next season, and sown outdoors the following fall.  
To effectively condition the seed for germination, 
store for two months in moist sand at 5ºC for 90 days.  
After pre-chilling, expose the seeds to fluctuating 
temperatures from 12/72ºC for 10 days (Young and 
Young 1992).  With some species, the warm 
stratification period may be replaced by mechanical 
scarification or soaking in sulfuric acid.  Seeds sown 
in nursery beds should be covered with 0.25-0.5 in 
(0.6-1.25 cm) of soil.  Fall-sown beds should be 
mulched during the winter. 
 
' WHERE symbol='cose16';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='Redosier dogwood is often coppiced in late fall after 
the leaves turn brown and fall off the stem.  Cut all 
stems to approximately 2-3 in (5-8 cm) from the base 
before growth begins in spring.  Apply fertilizer 
around the shrub to promote new growth, then apply 
mulch around the base.  Coppicing stimulates the 
growth of new, vigorous stems whose deep burgundy 
color is especially vivid. 
 
Traditional resource management: Redosier 
dogwood was traditionally tended by pruning or 
burning to produce long straight stems.  
•  Often basket weavers will prune many redosier 
dogwood stems, sometimes replanting the stems, 
so there will be nice straight basketry material 
the following year. 
•  Before gathering, offerings of thanks and prayers 
for permission to gather are given. Often tobacco 
or sage or other offerings are given before 
beginning to gather. 
•  Basket weavers process materials with their 
hands and mouths.  Herbicides sprayed along 
streams have a much higher health risk for 
humans when they are processed and used for 
traditional materials. 
 
Overgrazing, especially by livestock and big game, 
frequently changes plant species composition and 
growth form, density of stands, vigor, seed 
production of plants, and insect production.  
Livestock grazing can cause the replacement of bird 
and mammal species requiring the vertical vegetation 
structure of riparian habitat to species, which are 
ubiquitous in their habitat preferences.  Previous 
heavy cattle grazing changed the bird and small 
mammal community composition in riparian areas 
through reduction of shrub and herbaceous cover.

decoction after childbirth. 
 
The fruits were eaten by the Indians of the Missouri 
region (Densmore 1974).  The berries are known to 
be tart and bitter, but were nonetheless eaten by all of 
the southern Interior peoples of British Columbia, 
including the Nlaka’pamux, Lillooet, Okanagan-
Colville, Shuswap, Kootenay, Blackfeet, and the 
Flathead of Alberta and Montana (Kuhnlein and 
Turner 1991).  The fruits were gathered from August 
to October and eaten fresh, a few at a time, or, more 
commonly, were pounded and mixed with other 
fruits, such as chokecherries (Prunus virginiana) or 
Saskatoons (Amelanchier almifolia).  Some people 
mashed the berries and dried them in cakes. others 
dried and stored them.  Eating a few raw fruits was 
considered to be a good tonic among the 
Nlaka’pamux and the Okanagan-Colville, who ate 
them raw as a kind of “relish” (Turner 1978. Turner 
et al. 1990).   
 
Redosier dogwood is used for basket weaving.  
Sometimes called red willow, both Salix species and 
Cornus sericea are used interchangeably.  
Differences in stem color create a multi-hued design 
element.  Indian people from the mid-Columbia 
River used redosier dogwood to make “ribbons” for 
basket decorations (Schlick 1994).  If gathered in the 
early spring, the bark will retain its deep red color

Ethnobotanic: Native Americans smoke the inner 
bark of redosier dogwood in tobacco mixtures used in 
the sacred pipe ceremony.  Dream catchers, 
originating with the Potawotami, are made with the 
stems of the sacred redosier dogwood.  Some tribes 
ate the white, sour berries, while others used the 
branches for arrow-making, stakes, or other tools.  In 
California, peeled twigs were used as toothbrushes 
for their whitening effect on teeth (Strike 1994).  
Bows and arrows were made from Cornus shoots.  
The inner bark is used for tanning or drying animal 
hides. 
 
The Apache, Cheyenne, Dakota, Montana Indians, 
Ojibwa, Potawatomi, Omaha, Ponca, and Thompson 
Indians all use the inner bark in a tobacco mixture for 
smoking the sacred pipe (Moerman 1986).  The 
leaves and/or inner bark of redosier dogwood are also 
used as a smoking mixture by the Okanagan-Colville, 
the Flathead, the Kootenay, and the Blackfeet peoples 
in the western United States and Canada

when dried and could be mistaken for cherry.  The 
Hidatsa, Arikara, and Mandan made twill plaited 
burden baskets with two-toned dark and light 
designs. these baskets were made of willow (Salix 
nigra), redosier dogwood, and boxelder (Acer 
negundo) splints (Turnbaugh et al. 1986, Hart 1976).  
Willow and redosier dogwood were used by the 
Cheyenne, Arapaho, Kiowa, Pawnee, and Teton 
Sioux to make a coarsely coiled gambling basket for 
dice. 
 
The Ojibwa and the Chippewa used redosier 
dogwood bark as a dye.  The inner bark was mixed 
with other plants or minerals and used to make a red 
dye, a light red dye, a black dye, and an ecru or 
“khaki” colored dye (Densmore 1974).  
 
Wildlife: The fleshy fruits of dogwoods are very 
valuable to wildlife, particularly in the Northeast 
(Martin et al. 1951).  The fruit ripens in late summer, 
and besides being available through the fall, some of 
the berries may persist on the plants into the winter 
months.  Wildlife browse the twigs, foliage, and 
fruits.  Birds known to eat the fruit include: wood 
ducks, eastern bluebirds, cardinals, catbirds, long-
tailed chats, crows, purple finches, yellow-shafted 
flickers, crested flycatchers, grosbeaks, kingbirds, 
American magpies, mockingbirds, crested mynah 
birds, orioles, robins, yellow-bellied sapsuckers, 
European starlings, tree swallows, scarlet tanagers, 
brown thrashers, thrushes, vireos, pine warblers, 
cedar waxwings, and woodpeckers.  Gamebirds who 
eat both the fruits and buds include grouse, ring-
necked pheasants, band-tailed pigeons, greater prairie 
chickens, bobwhite quail, and wild turkeys.  The 
shrubs provide excellent nesting habitat for 
songbirds.  Mammals that eat the fruit and foliage 
include black bear, beaver, mountain beaver, 
cottontail rabbits, raccoons, eastern skunks, squirrels, 
chipmunks, mice, and rats.  Deer, elk, Mountain goat, 
and moose browse the twigs and foliage. 
 
Landscaping &amp. ornamental: Redosier dogwood is 
often planted as an ornamental, both to beautify the 
landscape and to attract birds.  Dogwood is often 
used for landscaping and as a secondary plant in 
windbreaks.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Description='General: Dogwood Family (Cornaceae).  Redosier 
dogwood is a woody deciduous shrub generally 1.4-6 
m (4.6-20 ft) tall.  The bark and twigs are reddish to 
purple and fairly smooth from autumn to late spring. 
after the leaves have fallen, the deep burgundy 
branches add color to the winter landscape.  The 
bark, twigs, and leaves are bright green in spring 
through summer.  The simple, opposite leaves are 5-
10 cm (2-4 in) long, dark green above and hairy and 
lighter-colored below, with smooth margins, rounded 
bases, pointed tips, and falsely parallel veins. 
Flowering occurs from June to August.  The 
inflorescence is a cyme, with 2-3 mm (0.08-0.12 in) 
white to cream-colored flowers.  The white berries 
are smooth on the faces, furrowed on the sides.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_='Redosier dogwood grows in soils that are 
saturated for at least a portion of the growing season.  
Redosier dogwood is common on the edges of lakes, 
ponds, within wetlands, and along streams.  Not as 
tolerant of long-term root saturation as are some 
other shrubs, dogwood seems to prefer wetland 
margins where soils are nitrogen-rich, saturated, and 
shallowly inundated in the spring, and may be 
completely dry by late summer.  It is tolerant of 
fluctuating water tables.  The “osier” in redosier 
dogwood is derived from French, meaning “willow-
like”. it is often called red willow because of its red 
stems. 
 
Propagation from cuttings: Redosier dogwood can 
be started easily by division, French layering, and 
hardwood cuttings.  To propagate suckers by 
division: 
•  Lift a root with suckers on it without disturbing 
•  Cut the main root back to the fibrous roots, then 
divide the suckers so that each has its own roots.  
Cut back the top-growth by about half. 
•  Treat each sucker or hardwood cutting at the 
base with IBA at 20,000 ppm liquid formulation 
to promote rooting.  Alternatively, treatment 
the parent plant.  Check that there are fibrous 
roots at the base of the suckers. 
•  Remove the suckering roots by cutting it off 
close to the parent plant.  Firm the soil around 
the parent plant. 

Page 3
•  Replant the suckers in open ground in prepared 
holes with good potting soil.  Firm the soil 
around the suckers and water. 
with 2 percent IBA talc. this will promote 
rooting on both suckers and stem cuttings. 
•  Before growth starts in the spring, lift the plant.  
Break the clump into sections, retaining those 
with vigorous shoots and well-developed roots. 
•  Prune any damaged roots, and cut back the top-
growth by one-third to a half to reduce water 
loss.  Replant the divisions in the open and water 
in dry weather. 
•  Ultimately, simply lift a suckering root, sever it 
from the parent plant, and then replant it in the 
open. 
 
To ensure survival of cuttings or suckers through the 
following winter in cold climates, the potted cuttings 
should be kept in heated cold frames or poly-houses 
to hold the temperature between 0-7°C (32-45°F).  
Rooted cuttings that had shoot growth in the fall, but 
were not given nitrogen, had the best over-winter 
survival in a cold frame with microfoam. 
 
French layering: Layering is a method where a stem 
is encouraged to develop roots before being removed 
from the parent plant. 
• 
In spring, plant a rooted layer or young plant, 
label it, and grow it for a season.  Then, in the 
dormant season, cut back the stem to within 3 
inches (8 cm) of the ground.  
In the following spring, apply a balanced 
fertilizer at the rate of 2-4-oz/sq yd (60-110 g/sq 
m).  Space the stems evenly again. dropping each 
into a 2-inch (5-cm) deep trench.  Peg down each 
stem and cover with soil, leaving the shoot tips 
exposed.  Hill up all but 2-3 inches (5-8 cm) of 
the new shoots as they develop, until the mound 
is 6 inches (15 cm) high.  Water as needed. 
• 
•  After leaf fall, carefully fork away the soil from 
around the new shoots until the stems that were 
laid horizontally are exposed.  Cut these flush 
with the basal area of the stems.  Then cut the 
stems to separate the rooted sections.  Pot these 
or plant them out in the open garden, and label 
them.  The same redosier dogwood basal area 
may be used to propagate further layers. 
 
Propagation by seed: Redosier dogwood is 
established easily from seed.  The best germination is 
obtained if the seeds are gathered as soon as the fruit 
starts to color or ripen, from August to October.  If 
the seeds are allowed to dry out, it is best to remove 
seeds from the fruit and soak in water.  
 
The best results are obtained from fall sowing of 
freshly harvested seeds.  Fruits collected too late to 
sow in the fall should be stored, pre-chilled until the 
next season, and sown outdoors the following fall.  
To effectively condition the seed for germination, 
store for two months in moist sand at 5ºC for 90 days.  
After pre-chilling, expose the seeds to fluctuating 
temperatures from 12/72ºC for 10 days (Young and 
Young 1992).  With some species, the warm 
stratification period may be replaced by mechanical 
scarification or soaking in sulfuric acid.  Seeds sown 
in nursery beds should be covered with 0.25-0.5 in 
(0.6-1.25 cm) of soil.  Fall-sown beds should be 
mulched during the winter. 
 
' WHERE symbol='coseo';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='Redosier dogwood is often coppiced in late fall after 
the leaves turn brown and fall off the stem.  Cut all 
stems to approximately 2-3 in (5-8 cm) from the base 
before growth begins in spring.  Apply fertilizer 
around the shrub to promote new growth, then apply 
mulch around the base.  Coppicing stimulates the 
growth of new, vigorous stems whose deep burgundy 
color is especially vivid. 
 
Traditional resource management: Redosier 
dogwood was traditionally tended by pruning or 
burning to produce long straight stems.  
•  Often basket weavers will prune many redosier 
dogwood stems, sometimes replanting the stems, 
so there will be nice straight basketry material 
the following year. 
•  Before gathering, offerings of thanks and prayers 
for permission to gather are given. Often tobacco 
or sage or other offerings are given before 
beginning to gather. 
•  Basket weavers process materials with their 
hands and mouths.  Herbicides sprayed along 
streams have a much higher health risk for 
humans when they are processed and used for 
traditional materials. 
 
Overgrazing, especially by livestock and big game, 
frequently changes plant species composition and 
growth form, density of stands, vigor, seed 
production of plants, and insect production.  
Livestock grazing can cause the replacement of bird 
and mammal species requiring the vertical vegetation 
structure of riparian habitat to species, which are 
ubiquitous in their habitat preferences.  Previous 
heavy cattle grazing changed the bird and small 
mammal community composition in riparian areas 
through reduction of shrub and herbaceous cover.

leaves and/or inner bark of redosier dogwood are also 
used as a smoking mixture by the Okanagan-Colville, 
the Flathead, the Kootenay, and the Blackfeet  
 
peoples in the western United States and Canada 
(Hellson 1974, Hart 1976, Turner 1978, Turner et al. 
1980, Johnston 1987).  The Navaho-Kayentaf and 
Navaho-Ramah used the plant ceremonially as a 
Mountain-top-way emetic (Moerman 1986).  An 
infusion of redosier dogwood bark was used as an 
anti-diarrheal by the Chippewa and the Potawatomi, 
an antidote for weak kidneys by the Shuswap, and a 
pediatric aid for children who wet the bed by the 
Shuswap.  The Chippewa used an infusion of the 
bark for eruptions caused by poison ivy.  The 
Chippewa and the Micmac used a decoction of 
redosier dogwood root for sore eyes and catarrh.  The 
Okanagan and the Thompson Indians took a 
decoction of the leaves.  Other remedies treated by 
redosier dogwood included headaches, sore throats, a 
wash for ulcers, a substitute for “larb”, and a 
decoction of bark was taken as an antidote for 
weakness. 
 
The Maidu of Northern California used redosier 
dogwood as a tonic, a laxative, emetic, and cathartic 
(Strike 1994).  Maidu women took a dogwood 
decoction after childbirth. 
 
The fruits were eaten by the Indians of the Missouri 
region (Densmore 1974).  The berries are known to 
be tart and bitter, but were nonetheless eaten by all of 
the southern Interior peoples of British Columbia, 
including the Nlaka’pamux, Lillooet, Okanagan-
Colville, Shuswap, Kootenay, Blackfeet, and the 
Flathead of Alberta and Montana (Kuhnlein and 
Turner 1991).  The fruits were gathered from August 
to October and eaten fresh, a few at a time, or, more 
commonly, were pounded and mixed with other 
fruits, such as chokecherries (Prunus virginiana) or 
Saskatoons (Amelanchier almifolia).  Some people 
mashed the berries and dried them in cakes. others 
dried and stored them.  Eating a few raw fruits was 
considered to be a good tonic among the 
Nlaka’pamux and the Okanagan-Colville, who ate 
them, raw as a kind of “relish” (Turner 1978. Turner 
et al. 1990).   
 
Redosier dogwood is used for basket weaving.

Sioux to make a coarsely coiled gambling basket for 
dice. 
 
The Ojibwa and the Chippewa used redosier 
dogwood bark as a dye.  The inner bark was mixed 
with other plants or minerals and used to make a red 
dye, a light red dye, a black dye, and an ecru or 
“khaki” colored dye (Densmore 1974).  
 
Wildlife: The fleshy fruits of dogwoods are very 
valuable to wildlife, particularly in the Northeast 
(Martin et al. 1951).  The fruit ripens in late summer, 
and besides being available through the fall, some of 
the berries may persist on the plants into the winter 
months.  Wildlife browse the twigs, foliage, and 
fruits.  Birds known to eat the fruit include: wood 
ducks, eastern bluebirds, cardinals, catbirds, long-
tailed chats, crows, purple finches, yellow-shafted 
flickers, crested flycatchers, grosbeaks, kingbirds, 
American magpies, mockingbirds, crested mynah 
birds, orioles, robins, yellow-bellied sapsuckers, 
European starlings, tree swallows, scarlet tanagers, 
brown thrashers, thrushes, vireos, pine warblers, 
cedar waxwings, and woodpeckers.  Game birds who 
eat both the fruits and buds include grouse, ring-
necked pheasants, band-tailed pigeons, greater prairie 
chickens, bobwhite quail, and wild turkeys.  The 
shrubs provide excellent nesting habitat for 
songbirds.  Mammals that eat the fruit and foliage 
include black bear, beaver, mountain beaver, 
cottontail rabbits, raccoons, eastern skunks, squirrels, 
chipmunks, mice, and rats.  Deer, elk, Mountain goat, 
and moose browse the twigs and foliage. 
 
Landscaping &amp. ornamental: Redosier dogwood is 
often planted as an ornamental, both to beautify the 
landscape and to attract birds.  Dogwood is often 
used for landscaping and as a secondary plant in 
windbreaks.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Description='General: Dogwood Family (Cornaceae).  Redosier 
dogwood is a woody deciduous shrub generally 1.4-6 
m (4.6-20 ft) tall.  The bark and twigs are reddish to 
purple and fairly smooth from autumn to late spring. 
after the leaves have fallen, the deep burgundy 
branches add color to the winter landscape.  The 
bark, twigs, and leaves are bright green in spring 
through summer.  The simple, opposite leaves are 5-
10 cm (2-4 in) long, dark green above and hairy and 
lighter-colored below, with smooth margins, rounded 
bases, pointed tips, and falsely parallel veins. 
Flowering occurs from June to August.  The 
inflorescence is a cyme, with 2-3 mm (0.08-0.12 in) 
white to cream-colored flowers.  The white berries 
are smooth on the faces, furrowed on the sides.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_ TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_='Redosier dogwood grows in soils that are 
saturated for at least a portion of the growing season.  
Redosier dogwood is common on the edges of lakes, 
ponds, within wetlands, and along streams.  Not as 
tolerant of long-term root saturation as are some 
other shrubs, dogwood seems to prefer wetland 
margins where soils are nitrogen-rich, saturated, and 
shallowly inundated in the spring, and may be 
completely dry by late summer.  It is tolerant of 
fluctuating water tables.  The “osier” in redosier 
dogwood is derived from French, meaning “willow-
like”. it is often called red willow because of its red 
stems. 
 
Propagation from cuttings: Redosier dogwood can be 
started easily by division, French layering, and 
hardwood cuttings.  To propagate suckers by 
division: 
•  Lift a root with suckers on it without disturbing 
the parent plant.  Check that there are fibrous 
roots at the base of the suckers. 
•  Remove the suckering roots by cutting it off 
close to the parent plant.  Firm the soil around 
the parent plant. 

Page 3
•  Cut the main root back to the fibrous roots, then 
divide the suckers so that each has its own roots.  
Cut back the top-growth by about half. 
•  Treat each sucker or hardwood cutting at the 
base with IBA at 20,000 ppm liquid formulation 
to promote rooting.  Alternatively, treatment 
with 2 percent IBA talc. this will promote 
rooting on both suckers and stem cuttings. 
 
•  Replant the suckers in open ground in prepared 
holes with good potting soil.  Firm the soil 
around the suckers and water. 
•  Before growth starts in the spring, lift the plant.  
Break the clump into sections, retaining those 
with vigorous shoots and well-developed roots. 
•  Prune any damaged roots, and cut back the top-
growth by one-third to a half to reduce water 
loss.  Replant the divisions in the open and water 
in dry weather. 
•  Ultimately, simply lift a suckering root, sever it 
from the parent plant, and then replant it in the 
open. 
 
To ensure survival of cuttings or suckers through the 
following winter in cold climates, the potted cuttings 
should be kept in heated cold frames or poly-houses 
to hold the temperature between 0-7°C (32-45°F).  
Rooted cuttings that had shoot growth in the fall, but 
were not given nitrogen, had the best over-winter 
survival in a cold frame with microfoam. 
 
French layering: Layering is a method where a stem 
is encouraged to develop roots before being removed 
from the parent plant. 
• 
In spring, plant a rooted layer or young plant, 
label it, and grow it for a season.  Then, in the 
dormant season, cut back the stem to within 3 
inches (8 cm) of the ground.  
In the following spring, apply a balanced 
fertilizer at the rate of 2-4-oz/sq yd (60-110 g/sq 
m).  Space the stems evenly again. dropping each 
into a 2-inch (5-cm) deep trench.  Peg down each 
stem and cover with soil, leaving the shoot tips 
exposed.  Hill up all but 2-3 inches (5-8 cm) of 
the new shoots as they develop, until the mound 
is 6 inches (15 cm) high.  Water as needed. 
• 
•  After leaf fall, carefully fork away the soil from 
around the new shoots until the stems that were 
laid horizontally are exposed.  Cut these flush 
with the basal area of the stems.  Then cut the 
stems to separate the rooted sections.  Pot these 
or plant them out in the open garden, and label 
them.  The same redosier dogwood basal area 
may be used to propagate further layers. 
 
 
Propagation by seed: Redosier dogwood is 
established easily from seed.  The best germination is 
obtained if the seeds are gathered as soon as the fruit 
starts to color or ripen, from August to October.  If 
the seeds are allowed to dry out, it is best to remove 
seeds from the fruit and soak in water.  
 
The best results are obtained from fall sowing of 
freshly harvested seeds.  Fruits collected too late to 
sow in the fall should be stored, pre-chilled until the 
next season, and sown outdoors the following fall.  
To effectively condition the seed for germination, 
store for two months in moist sand at 5ºC for 90 days.  
After pre-chilling, expose the seeds to fluctuating 
temperatures from 12/72ºC for 10 days (Young and 
Young 1992).  With some species, the warm 
stratification period may be replaced by mechanical 
scarification or soaking in sulfuric acid.  Seeds sown 
in nursery beds should be covered with 0.25-0.5 in 
(0.6-1.25 cm) of soil.  Fall-sown beds should be 
mulched during the winter. 
 
' WHERE symbol='coses';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='Redosier dogwood is often coppiced in late fall after 
the leaves turn brown and fall off the stem.  Cut all 
stems to approximately 2-3 in (5-8 cm) from the base 
before growth begins in spring.  Apply fertilizer 
around the shrub to promote new growth, then apply 
mulch around the base.  Coppicing stimulates the 
growth of new, vigorous stems whose deep burgundy 
color is especially vivid. 
 
Traditional resource management: Redosier 
dogwood was traditionally tended by pruning or 
burning to produce long straight stems.  
•  Often basket weavers will prune many redosier 
dogwood stems, sometimes replanting the stems, 
so there will be nice straight basketry material 
the following year. 
•  Before gathering, offerings of thanks and prayers 
for permission to gather are given. Often tobacco 
or sage or other offerings are given before 
beginning to gather. 
•  Basket weavers process materials with their 
hands and mouths.  Herbicides sprayed along 
streams have a much higher health risk for 
humans when they are processed and used for 
traditional materials. 
 
Overgrazing, especially by livestock and big game, 
frequently changes plant species composition and 
growth form, density of stands, vigor, seed 
production of plants, and insect production.  
Livestock grazing can cause the replacement of bird 
and mammal species requiring the vertical vegetation 
structure of riparian habitat to species, which are 

Page 4
ubiquitous in their habitat preferences.  Previous 
heavy cattle grazing changed the bird and small 
mammal community composition in riparian areas 
through reduction of shrub and herbaceous cover.

1/4 of the plants in an area should be collected. 
 
These plants establish extremely well from seed.  
Seed production is prolific and germination rates are 
high.  In wetland areas, revegetation of Cyperus 
occurs naturally where there is water, wind, or animal 
dispersal, or from the seed bank.  It is likely that 
Cyperus will re-vegetate naturally. seeding or 
planting in native plant communities is not a good 
idea because of its invasive nature.  This plant grows 
in gardens that are irrigated, or where there is some 
natural moisture. 
 
Establishment from Seed 
•  Collect nutgrass seed in the fall and broadcast 
seed in late fall or early spring.  Seeds can be 
broadcast on a moist and bare soil surface.  
Cover with a shallow layer of soil.  
•  To collect and store seed, collect when seed is 
ripe and store in a dry and cool place.  Clean 
seed by blowing out the light seed. 
•  Plant seeds in the greenhouse in 1&quot. x 1&quot. x 2&quot. 
pots, 1/4&quot. under the soil surface.  Keep soil 
surface moist.  Put in temperature of 100 degrees 
F (plus or minus 5 degrees).  Seeds begin to 
germinate after a couple weeks in warm 
temperatures.   
•  Plants are ready in 100 - 120 days to come out as 
plugs.  By planting seeds in August, plugs are 
ready to plant in soil by November.  These plants 
are very small. growing plants to a larger size 
will result in increased revegetation success.  
•  Nutsedge would do well grown in wild gardens 
or cultivated for its edible tubers.  Cyperus 
species tolerate disturbance, moderate grazing, 
and trampling.

kinds of brodiaeas have gained popularity as cut-
flower crops. 
 
Wildlife: Corms are eaten by both small and large 
mammals included black bears, mule deer, exotic 
wild pigs, and pocket gophers.  The corms of blue 
dicks are highly desirable to vertebrates, and it 
appears that some corms are sacrificed to corm-eating 
animals as a price for the dispersal of others.  The 
mammals detach the tiny corms as they go, aerating 
soil, preparing the seedbed, thinning the plant 
population, and leaving cormlets behind.  Once 
dislodged, cormlets may take less time to reach 
flowering size.

communities including vernal pools, coastal strand, 
mixed evergreen forest, chaparral, valley grassland, 
desert scrub, coniferous forests, oak woodlands, 
montane scree, and on the fringe of coastal salt marsh 
and redwood forest.   
It appears that it does not colonize after fire by seed, 
but rather is a permanent resident all along, occurring 
as inconspicuous corms in the soil throughout mature 
chaparral, often not flowering until an appropriate 
disturbance.  With fire, plants are released from 
unfavorable shaded environments with brush 
competition, and vigorously flower in open 
environments with increased soil nutrients. 
 
If possible, obtain the seed and corms from local 
sources near where they will be planted, to maintain 
genetic diversity of blue dicks and for the best 
adaptation to local conditions.  Some plant nurseries 
may label their corms and seeds according to 
geographic source. 
 
Propagation by seed: Seeds sown in the fall usually 
readily germinate and do not need special treatment.  
If sown at other times of the year the seeds may need 
one month s stratification.  If planting seeds, they will 
take several years to reach flowering size.  Scatter 
seeds and rake them lightly into the soil in full or 
partial sunlight.  If planting seeds in pots--then place 
them in reduced sunlight on the east or north side of a 
building or under a deciduous tree.  Plant the seeds at 
a depth, which equals the width of the seeds.  They 
should be planted in a well-drained soil.  Water the 
seeds after planting and don t let the soil dry out 
completely.  Water them again when the surface is 
dry to the touch.  Water the seeds gently so as not to 
exhume the seed.  If using a watering can, diffuse the 
water flow with a sprinkler fan or head.  Protect the 
seeds from animals and cold, dry winds, and from 
weed competition.  The seedlings should be watered 
through the spring.  At the beginning of hot weather, 
the leaves will start to yellow.  At this time, cease 
watering.  If the seeds are in pots, then move them in 
summer to a darker area, such as a carport or garage 
and keep a screen on them to keep out foraging 
animals.  When the weather cools down once again, 
move the pots back outside and go through a full rain 
or watering cycle once again.  After 24 months, the 
corms can be planted in full sun or filtered shade in 
October or November.  Plant them about six inches 
apart or scatter the corms and plant them where they 
fall to give them a look of a &quot.natural&quot. distribution.  
After one bloom, the plants should be well 
established so that they don t need to be weeded or 
watered unless it is a dry winter.  If it is a dry winter, 
then water every three weeks. 
 
 
 
Corms are the easiest to start.  Plant bigger corms 3-4 
inches deep and smaller corms 1-2 inches deep in 
well-drained soil in full sun in the autumn, and the 
plants can tolerate afternoon sun.  Space the corms 
one-inch apart.  If pocket gophers are a problem, you 
may want to dig a hole and line it with chicken wire 
mesh, before planting corms.  (Plastic mesh won t 
stop gophers.)  Water the plants (wet, but not soggy) 
and then wait for the winter rains.  The plant is 
common in climates that have rain in winter and 
spring, and a summer dry season.  Therefore, 
simulate these conditions in the garden.  The plant is 
intolerant of frequent summer water and should not 
be planted near lawns or plants that require a lot of 
moisture during the summer.  Weed around the plants 
regularly.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='There are five major types of indigenous 
management activities conducted in California that 
were designed to ensure future corm production at 
traditional gathering sites: 1) conscious breaking off 
cormlets from the harvested parent corms and 
replanting them. 2) sparing whole plants. 3) 
harvesting the corms after plants have gone to seed 
and dumping the seeds in the hole. 4) burning areas. 
and 5) irrigation.  Periodic digging and thinning of 
the corms, and popping off the cormlets, and 
replanting them may enhance blue dicks numbers and 
densities.  Digging corms may in fact be a form of 
tillage, which will increase the size of the gathering 
tract, aerate the soil, lower weed competition, and 
prepare the seedbed to increase seed germination 
rates.  If blue dicks populations require periodic 
disturbance to maintain and increase their 
populations, then indigenous harvesting regimes, if 
reenacted, may help maintain populations.  At the 
very least, populations that become overcrowded and 
show reduced vigor should be divided and separated. 
 
Traditionally, various tribes in California have 
burned areas of blue dicks to reduce plant 
competition, facilitate gathering, recycle nutrients, 
and increase the size and number of corms.  Today 
grasslands that have been burned may exhibit 
thousands of blue dicks plants where none appeared 
to occur before.  Corms and bulbs may sit for a 
decade or more and wait for fire or other favorable 
environmental conditions before breaking ground.  
Suppression of fire may cause increased shade and 
plant competition and decrease population numbers 
of blue dicks.

General: Lily Family (Liliaceae).  Blue dicks is an 
herbaceous perennial.  Major identifying features of 
blue dicks include a dense cluster of purple-blue or 
occasional white flowers with six fertile stamens, a 
twisted and fleshy stem, two basal leaves, a set of 
membranous, petal-like stamen appendages around 
the anthers, and angular black seeds.  It reproduces 
from seed and vegetative means in the form of corms.  
The cormlets are attached to the parent corm by 
stolons or sessile, produced in the axils of the old leaf 
bases on the mature corm. 
 
Blue dicks may reach two feet in height, thrives in 
open disturbed environments, and it frequently occurs

gathered with digging sticks in over half of 
California, parts of the Great Basin and Southwest.  
These corms formed an important starch source in the

continue to dig the corms before flowering, during 
flowering, or after seeding depending upon the tribe 
and individual family.  Traditional gathering sites 
were visited annually, over long periods of time and 
there are references to gathering tracts of different 
kinds of corms and bulbs specifically owned and 
maintained by particular families.  Today different 
kinds of brodiaeas have gained popularity as cut-
flower crops. 
 
Wildlife: Corms are eaten by both small and large 
mammals included black bears, mule deer, exotic 
wild pigs, and pocket gophers.  The corms of blue 
dicks are highly desirable to vertebrates, and it

disturbance.  With fire, plants are released from 
unfavorable shaded environments with brush 
competition, and vigorously flower in open 
environments with increased soil nutrients. 
 
If possible, obtain the seed and corms from local 
sources near where they will be planted, to maintain 
genetic diversity of blue dicks and for the best 
adaptation to local conditions.  Some plant nurseries 
may label their corms and seeds according to 
geographic source. 
 
Propagation by seed: Seeds sown in the fall usually 
readily germinate and do not need special treatment.  
If sown at other times of the year the seeds may need 
one month s stratification.  If planting seeds, they will 
take several years to reach flowering size.  Scatter 
seeds and rake them lightly into the soil in full or 
partial sunlight.  If planting seeds in pots--then place 
them in reduced sunlight on the east or north side of a 
building or under a deciduous tree.  Plant the seeds at 
a depth, which equals the width of the seeds.  They 
should be planted in a well-drained soil.  Water the 
seeds after planting and don t let the soil dry out 
completely.  Water them again when the surface is 
dry to the touch.  Water the seeds gently so as not to 
exhume the seed.  If using a watering can, diffuse the 
water flow with a sprinkler fan or head.  Protect the 
seeds from animals and cold, dry winds, and from 
weed competition.  The seedlings should be watered 
through the spring.  At the beginning of hot weather, 
the leaves will start to yellow.  At this time, cease 
watering.  If the seeds are in pots, then move them in 
summer to a darker area, such as a carport or garage 
and keep a screen on them to keep out foraging 
animals.  When the weather cools down once again, 
move the pots back outside and go through a full rain 
or watering cycle once again.  After 24 months, the 
corms can be planted in full sun or filtered shade in 
October or November.  Plant them about six inches 
apart or scatter the corms and plant them where they 
fall to give them a look of a &quot.natural&quot. distribution.  
After one bloom, the plants should be well 
established so that they don t need to be weeded or 
watered unless it is a dry winter.  If it is a dry winter, 
then water every three weeks. 
 
Corms are the easiest to start.  Plant bigger corms 3-4 
inches deep and smaller corms 1-2 inches deep in 
well-drained soil in full sun in the autumn, and the 
plants can tolerate afternoon sun.  Space the corms 
one-inch apart.  If pocket gophers are a problem, you 
may want to dig a hole and line it with chicken wire 
mesh, before planting corms.  (Plastic mesh won t 
stop gophers.)  Water the plants (wet, but not soggy) 
and then wait for the winter rains.  The plant is 
 
 
common in climates that have rain in winter and 
spring, and a summer dry season.  Therefore, 
simulate these conditions in the garden.  The plant is 
intolerant of frequent summer water and should not 
be planted near lawns or plants that require a lot of 
moisture during the summer.  Weed around the plants 
regularly. 
' WHERE symbol='dicap';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='There are five major types of indigenous 
management activities conducted in California that 
were designed to ensure future corm production at 
traditional gathering sites: 1) conscious breaking off 
cormlets from the harvested parent corms and 
replanting them. 2) sparing whole plants. 3) 
harvesting the corms after plants have gone to seed 
and dumping the seeds in the hole. 4) burning areas. 
and 5) irrigation.  Periodic digging and thinning of 
the corms, and popping off the cormlets, and 
replanting them may enhance blue dicks numbers and 
densities.  Digging corms may in fact be a form of 
tillage, which will increase the size of the gathering 
tract, aerate the soil, lower weed competition, and 
prepare the seedbed to increase seed germination 
rates.  If blue dicks populations require periodic 
disturbance to maintain and increase their 
populations, then indigenous harvesting regimes, if 
reenacted, may help maintain populations.  At the 
very least, populations that become overcrowded and 
show reduced vigor should be divided and separated. 
 
Traditionally, various tribes in California have 
burned areas of blue dicks to reduce plant 
competition, facilitate gathering, recycle nutrients, 
and increase the size and number of corms.  Today 
grasslands that have been burned may exhibit 
thousands of blue dicks plants where none appeared 
to occur before.  Corms and bulbs may sit for a 
decade or more and wait for fire or other favorable 
environmental conditions before breaking ground.  
Suppression of fire may cause increased shade and 
plant competition and decrease population numbers 
of blue dicks.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Uses='Ethnobotanic: The purple coneflower, Echinacea 
angustifolia, was and still is the most widely used 
medicinal plant of the Plains Indians (Kindscher 
1992).  It was used as a painkiller and for a variety of 
ailments, including toothache, coughs, colds, sore 
throats, and snake bite.  Echinacea angustifolia was 
used as an analgesic by the Cheyenne, the Dakota, 
the Fox, and the Winnebago (Moerman 1986).  
Purple coneflower is used as an antidote for 
poisonous conditions, snake bite, and other poisonous 
bites by the Winnebago, Ponca, Pawnee, Omaha, 
Dakota, and by most Montana tribes (Gilmore 1977).  
The root was used to relieve toothache by the Dakota, 
Omaha, Pawnee, Ponca, Teton Sioux, and 
Winnebago (Moerman 1986).  The Cheyenne chewed 
the root to stimulate the flow of saliva, which was 
especially useful for Sun Dance participants as a 
thirst preventative (Hart 1981).  A wash was used as 
                          Plant Guide  
 
a dressing for burns to relieve pain by the Dakota, 
Winnebago, Omaha, Pawnee, and Ponca. 
 
 
The Fox used purple coneflower as an anti-
convulsive and gastro-intestinal aid. The Kiowa 
chewed coneflower root for coughs and sore throats.  
The Omaha and Pawnee used a smoke treatment as a 
remedy for headache.  A poultice of smashed roots 
were applied as an anesthetic to arms and hands by 
the Omaha, and a poultice was applied to enlarged 
glands as a treatment for diseases such as mumps by 
the Pawnee, Ponca, Dakota, and Winnebago.  Purple 
coneflower was used to increase endurance in the 
sweat lodge ceremony by the Dakota, Pawnee, 
Ponca, and Winnebago.  The Lakota ate the root and 
green fruit when they were thirsty or perspiring 
(Rogers 1980, Munson 1981).  The Teton Sioux used 
coneflower to cure tonsillitis.  The Omaha and Ponca 
used the plant as eyewash.  When the roots were 
mixed with blazing star (Mentzelia laevicaulis) and 
boiled, the resulting tea was drunk for smallpox 
(Kindscher 1992).  Purple coneflower roots mixed 
with puffball (Lycoperdon species) spores and skunk 
oil were used in the treatment of boils.  The smoke 
from burning purple coneflower was used as a 
treatment for distemper in horses by the Ponca, 
Dakota, Pawnee, and Winnebago. 
 
The Omaha, the Lakota, and the Ponca sometimes 
used the seed heads to comb their hair (Kindscher 
1992).  Purple coneflower stalks were used in play by 
Pawnee children.  They would whirl two flower 
stalks one around the other, the two stalk touching by 
the flower heads.  
 
The purple coneflower was the only native prairie 
plant popularized as a medicine by folk practitioners 
and doctors, and was used extensively as a folk 
remedy (Kindscher 1992).  The use of the purple 
coneflower root was used by early settlers in 
Oklahoma as an aid in nearly every kind of sickness.  
If a cow or a horse did not eat well, people 
administered Echinacea in its feed. 
 
Echinacea is widely used as an herbal remedy today, 
primarily as an immuno-stimulant.  Echinacea 
angustifolia root was found to possess mild antibiotic 
activity against Streptococcus and Staphyloccus 
aureus (Stoll et al. 1950).  A pentane-oil extracted 
from the root was found to be inhibitory to Walker 
carcinosarcoma 256 and P-388 lymphocytic leukemia

(Voaden and Jacobson 1972).  Italian investigators 
found the wound-healing effects of Echinacea to be 
attributable to echinacin B (Bonadea et al. 1971).  
Perhaps the most important finding so far is the 
discovery of large, highly active polysaccharide 
molecules in E. angustifolia that possess 
immunostimulatory properties (Wagner and Proksch 
1985, Wagner et al. 1985).  Stimulation of the 
immune system appears to be strongly influenced by 
dose level.  Recent pharmacological studies indicate 
that a 10-mg/kg daily dose of the polysaccharide over 
a ten-day period is effective as an immuno-stimulant.  
Increases in the daily dosage beyond this level, 
however, resulted in “markedly decreased 
pharmacological activity” (Wagner and Proksch 
1985, Wagner et al. 1985).  Other research has shown 
that the purple coneflower produces an anti-
inflammatory effect and has therapeutic value in 
urology, gynecology, internal medicine, and 
dermatology (Wagner and Proksch 1985).   
 
Echinacea angustifolia also contains chemical 
compounds that are insecticidal.  One such 
compound is toxic to mosquitoes and houseflies. 
another substance, echinolone, disrupts insect 
development (Hartzell 1947, Jacobson 1954, Voaden 
and Jacobson 1972).  Researchers in the Horticulture 
Department of South Dakota State University are 
currently attempting to identify the Echinacea 
angustifolia germplasm containing the highest level 
of echinolone.  It will be used in manufacturing and 
insecticide for sunflower crops (Foster 1991). 
 
Ornamental: The purple coneflower is often grown 
simply for its ornamental value, especially for its 
showy flowers.  The best possibility for obtaining a 
new cultivar is in the hybrids between Echinacea 
purpurea and Echinacea angustifolia var. 
angustifolia, whose progeny are compact, rounded, 
and bushy plants about two feet in diameter 
(McGregor 1968).

leaves begin to turn brown.  Wash roots and remove 
most for use.  Then carefully divide the crown by 
hand to make one to five “plantlets.”  Replant the 
divisions as soon as possible.  It is important that they 
don’t dry out, so if replanting is delayed a couple of 
hours, dip the plants briefly in water and keep them 
in a sealed plastic bag in a cool, shady place until you 
are ready to replant them.  When replanting, ensure 
that the remaining fine roots are well spread out in 
the planting hole and the soil is pressed firmly around 
the plant.  These plantlets can be grown in flats in the 
greenhouse during the winter to re-establish their root 
systems, then replanted in the field the following 
spring for another round of production.

germination.  Actually, when the proper steps are 
take, it has extremely dependable germination.  
The following information is provided by Richo 
Cech (1995). 
•  Seeds require a 12-week period of cold 
conditioning, or cold stratification, to germinate. 
•  Outdoors, scatter seed thinly on well-limed, 
weed-free, open beds in the fall or early winter, 
covering the seed with a light sifting of potting 
soil.  The seed is thereby subjected to the optimal 
conditions of oscillating temperatures, an 
extremely important pre-germination 
environment for Echinacea seed. 
•  An acceptable alternative to outdoor cold 
conditioning is to mix the seeds with damp sand 
and switch between the refrigerator and freezer 
several times over a period of 12 weeks.  This 
seed may then be sown directly in the garden or 
field.  The conditioned seed may also be sown in 
flats and placed in the greenhouse or outside. 
•  Another method of cold stratification is to wrap 
the seeds in wet peat moss and place them in a 
plastic bag in the refrigerator for two to four 
months.  Plant seeds in deep plug trays. this 
allows the taproot to develop straight down to a 
depth of six or eight inches prior to 
transplanting.   Seeds should be barely covered 
with soil when planted. 
•  E. angustifolia seedlings have a tendency toward 
transplant shock and slow growth, especially if 
the development of the taproot is compromised 
by keeping seedlings in the flats or plots too 
long.  Seedlings have little vigor and must be 
carefully weeded and watered. 
•  For field cultivation, close spacing of the plants 
allows for optimal root yield per area planted.  
Plants may be thinned to 6-12 inch spacing in the 
row or bed.  Keep relatively free of weeds and 
water occasionally during dry spells.  Over-
watering should be avoided, for the root crowns 
are subject to rotting.  A sparing side dressing of 
organic compost, usually in the mid-spring, will 
assist this sometimes slow-growing herbaceous 
perennial in outranking competitive weeds. 
 
An ounce of well-cleaned E. angustifolia seed 
contains approximately 8,000 seeds.  A pound 
contains around 128,000 seeds.  Given a very tight 
spacing of six inches between the plants and one foot 
between the rows, an acre would contain 87,200 
plants.  Given a 68% germination rate, a pound of 
good seed could produce an acre of plants.  This 
same acre, dormant harvested for the roots at the end 
of the second year of growth, would produce (at ¼ lb. 
per root) 21,800 lbs of fresh root.

1986).  The Delaware used an infusion of coneflower 
root for gonorrhea and found it to be highly effective. 
 
The purple coneflower was the only native prairie 
plant popularized as a medicine by folk practitioners 
and doctors.  It was used extensively as a folk remedy 
(Kindscher 1992).  Purple coneflower root was used 
by early settlers as an aid in nearly every kind of 
sickness.  If a cow or a horse did not eat well, people 
administered Echinacea in its feed. 
 
Echinacea is widely used as an herbal remedy today.  
A purple coneflower product containing the juice of 
the fresh aerial parts of Echinacea purpurea was 
found to make mouse cells 50-80 percent resistant to 
influenza, herpes, and vesicular somatitis viruses.  
This product was available in Germany in 1978 
(Wacker and Hilbig 1978).  Perhaps the most 
important finding so far is the discovery of immuno-
stimulatory properties in Echinacea purpurea and E. 
angustifolia (Wagner and Proksch 1985, Wagner et 
al. 1985).  Stimulation of the immune system appears 
to be strongly influenced by dose level.  Recent 
pharmacological studies indicate that a 10-mg/kg 
daily dose of the polysaccharide over a ten-day 
period is effective as an immuno-stimulant.  
Increases in the daily dosage beyond this level, 
however, resulted in “markedly decreased 
pharmacological activity” (Wagner and Proksch 
1985, Wagner et al. 1985).  Other research has shown 
that the purple coneflower produces an anti-
inflammatory effect and has therapeutic value in 
urology, gynecology, internal medicine, and 
dermatology (Wagner and Proksch 1985). 
 
Ornamental: The purple coneflower is often grown 
simply for its ornamental value, especially for its 
showy flowers.  The best possibility for obtaining a 
new cultivar is in the hybrids between Echinacea 
purpurea and E. angustifolia var. angustifolia, whose 
progeny are compact, rounded, and bushy plants 
about two feet in diameter (McGregor 1968).

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Native Echinacea species are dwindling in the wild 
from loss of habitat and over-harvesting.  E. 
purpurea is not as threatened as E. angustifolia.  In 
the wild, E. purpurea grows sporadically along 
waterways, with a few scattered individuals.  Plant 
densities are too low for efficient harvest for 
commercial purposes.  E. purpurea is the most 
widely adaptable species for cultivation.  It is cold 
and heat hardy, easy to grow, and boasts high yields.  
Bioactive constituents of E. purpurea compare 
favorably with E. angustifolia, although there are 
proportional differences.  E. angustifolia has more of 
the alkylamides, while E. purpurea has more of the 
equally immune enhancing caffeic acid derivatives.  
They are both effective medicines.  A combination of 
both probably affords the most broad-spectrum 
immune-enhancing effect.  Historically, E. purpurea 
was rarely utilized by pharmaceutical companies.  
 
It takes three to four years for roots to reach 
harvestable size (Foster 1991).  Yields for cultivated, 
dried roots of three-year-old Echinacea purpurea 
grown at Trout Lake, Washington, were 131 kg/ha 
(1,200 lbs/acre) (Foster 1991).  According to Richo 
Cech (1995), a mature two-year old E. purpurea 
plant yields 2.25 pounds of fresh flowering aerial 
portions and 0.5 pounds of fresh root per plant.

initially and eliminates the tedious nurturing and 
 
 
tending of the slow-growing seedlings (Kindscher 
1992).  Harvest roots when plants are dormant, when 
leaves begin to turn brown.  Wash roots and remove 
most for use.  Then carefully divide the crown by 
hand to make one to five “plantlets.”  Replant the 
divisions as soon as possible.  It is important that they 
don’t dry out, so if replanting is delayed a couple of 
hours, dip the plants briefly in water and keep them 
in a sealed plastic bag in a cool, shady place until you 
are ready to replant them.  When replanting, ensure 
that the remaining fine roots are well spread out in 
the planting hole and the soil is pressed firmly around 
the plant.  These plantlets can be grown in flats in the 
greenhouse during the winter to re-establish their root 
systems, then replanted in the field the following 
spring for another round of production.

The following information is provided by Richo 
Cech (1995). 
•  The seed can be spring-planted without cold, or 
cold stratification, to germinate. 
•  Propagation is easily done in flats, which are 
sown with approximately ¼ ounce of seed per 
flat, evenly sprinkled on the surface and covered 
with about ¼ inch of potting soil.  
•  The flats are left outdoors through the winter and 
watered if necessary. 
•  A light screen over the flats will diminish the 
severity of heavy rain and snow, and will also 
keep out cats. 
•  Spring germination can be greatly enhanced by 
bringing the flat of cold-conditioned seed into 
the greenhouse, whereupon rapid germination 
may be expected. 
•  Once the second set of true leaves appears, the 
seedlings are put into pots or are spaced at 
approximately two inch centers in another deep 
flat.  Seedlings must be carefully weeded and 
watered. 
In late spring or early summer, the hardy 
seedlings, now with a four-to-six inch root 
system, may be transplanted into the field or 
garden one or two feet apart. 
• 
•  Regular spacing with one foot between the plants 
and two feet between the rows will result in 
approximately 21, 800 plants per acre.  A 
generous two-foot spacing with three feet 
between the rows will result in approximately 
7,500 plants per acre.  
•  Timely watering during dry periods greatly 
increases the size of this plant.  A sparing side 
dressing of organic compost, usually in the mid-

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Description='General: Ephedra Family (Ephedraceae).  Gray 
ephedra is a dioecious, xerophytic shrub with jointed 
or fluted stems and scale-like leaves.  Leaf scales are 
in twos, 2-6mm long, sheathing to about the middle, 
and obtuse to acute at the apex.  The inflorescence is 
conelike and the staminate flowers have united 
filaments.  The ovulate spikes are distinctly stalked 
and the seeds are usually paired.

all the creosote bush deserts at mostly 1,000 to 4,000 
ft (305-1,220 m) elevation and sometimes it is found 
in the desert grassland up to 5,000 ft. (1,524 m).  It 
inhabits California in the eastern Mojave and 
Colorado deserts, southern Nevada in Clark and 
Lincoln counties, southwestern Utah, Arizona in the 
Grand Canyon area and in the Mojave.  It also occurs 
in Arizona and Colorado deserts, New Mexico along 
the Gila and Pecos river drainage, TransPecos Texas, 
the Edwards Plateau, and at scattered locations on the 
Rio Grande Plain, Baja California to Coahuila and 
Central Mexico (Benson and Darrow 1981).

On good seed years abundant collections of ephedra 
seeds can be obtained by flailing the fruiting 
branches over an open tray (Young 1986).  Seed is 
harvested by hand from native stands.  No seed fields 
have been established and no work has been done to 
determine the best method of mechanically 
harvesting the seed.  The plants  response to clipping 
for harvest is also undetermined (USDA 1983).  
Collected seed was cleaned with ease to a high purity 
with a fanning mill equipped with a No. 12 top screen 
and a No. 1/12 bottom screen (Kay 1975a).

The plant is still prepared as a 
beverage and drank today.  The 
Panamint and Owens Valley 
Paiute of California ate the 
seeds.  The Moapa Paiute and 
Shoshone in the Great Basin 
brewed a tea from the twigs to 
treat venereal diseases.  The Shoshone also imbibed a 
tea to stimulate urination and made the powdered 
twigs into poultices for sores.  The Kawaiisu steeped 
a tea of the twigs for backache.  The Cahuilla in 
southern California made a tea to cure stomach and 
kidney ailments and to cleanse their system.  The 
Zuni prepared and drunk a tea from the plant, minus 
the root, to treat the first stage of syphilis. 
 
Ephedra s unique and attractive evergreen or gray 
foliage makes it a desirable species for environmental 
plantings.  It is also used in preparation of herbal teas 
(Keeler 1989). 
 
Wildlife and livestock: Mountain quail eat Ephedra 
seeds.  Deer, bison, and antelope browse the plant.  
Gray ephedra is usually grazed heavily and seems to 
be perfectly safe for grazing livestock since it induces 
neither toxicity in ewes or cows, nor congenital 
deformities in lambs (Keeler 1989).  New seedlings 
should be protected from grazing based on the key 
species in the mix.  Proper use is based on one-half 
the current year s growth (USDA 1983).

The seeds germinate best at alternating temperature 
requirements with quite cold nighttime temperatures.  
Seedlings grow rapidly and can be easily transplanted 
(Young 1986).  Germination of gray ephedra seed 
was optimal when the temperature alternated between 
20 C (16 hours) and 25 C (2 hours).  It germinates 
well in the range of 10 and 20 C, but is highest at 20 
C (Kay 1977). 
 
Gray ephedra should perform best on limy sites, most 
textures, excluding clay and silty clay textures.  
According to Young, Evans, and Kay (1977), 
Ephedra nevadensis appears to have an adaptation for 
seed germination under osmotic potentials as low as -
12 bars and thus could be seeded in salt-desert 
conditions.  Depth-of-planting studies resulted in the 
emergence of 30% (42% on a viable-seed basis, with 
insect damaged seed removed) from a depth of 1 cm 
over a 10-day period with temperatures averaging 
about 10 C.  Total emergence was similar at 2 cm, 
though slightly delayed.  Roughly 13% (18% viable 
seed) emergence, delayed further, was recorded for 4 
cm (Kay 1975).  Seed storage at room temperature 
for 12 months after maturity reduced germinability 
(Young 1977).

This plant is still highly valued as a beverage today 
by many tribes and it is utilized as a tonic and blood 
purifier.  The twigs were mixed with the inner bark  
 
of Purshia tridentata to make a tea for drinking by 
the Shoshone to treat gonorrhea.  The Hopi used the 
plant in the treatment of syphilis.  The Paiute and 
Shoshone also used a steeped tea made from the 
twigs as a regulator for kidney or sometimes bladder 
disorders.  Washoe women imbibed a tea for delayed 
or difficult menstruation.  The Kawaiisu of California 
steeped a tea for backache.  The Navaho of Arizona 
gathered the twigs and leaves and boiled them with 
alum to produce a light-tan color. 
 
The vivid green foliage presents a striking contrast to 
an often-dull gray desert environment.  It has been 
widely planted as an ornamental.  This species is 
used in seed mixtures for re-vegetating depleted 
game ranges in the mountain shrub and juniper-
pinyon types and optionally in the sagebrush type in 
Utah.  Characteristics and qualities also are suited for 
soil stabilization and highway and park 
beautification. 
 
Wildlife: The mountain quail eats The seeds of 
Ephedra species and the plant is browsed by deer, 
bison, and antelope.

mass of yellow clusters of pollen sacs, and the green 
ovules (later brown seeds) are an obvious but less 
conspicuous feature of the female plant.  At the 
Tucson PMC, green ephedra begins flowering in 
mid-to late-April.  The pollen cones are spheroidal 
and 3 to 4 mm in diameter.  The pollen sacs are 
relatively large, 0.5 mm long and 0.5 to 0.6 mm 
broad, and are practically lacking stalks.  The ovulate 
cones have stalks 2 to 10 mm long, ovoid, and 5 to 7 
mm long.  The cone scales are in about 3 to 5 pairs, 
not membranous, and ovately shaped.  They are 
green at the middles, lighter colored and thinner 
toward the margins, 2 to 5 mm long, and not stalked.  
The seeds are more or less boat-shaped, the flat 
&quot.deck&quot. of each facing the other member of the pair.  
They are dark greenish lead color, 5 to 7 mm long, 
about 2 to 2.5 mm broad, and not beaked (Benson 
and Darrow 1981). 
 
At the onset of the flowering period, plants bearing 
ovules exert a structure called a micropylar tube at 
the apex of the ovule.  The micropylar tube allows 
the ovule to produce and display a small droplet from 
the exerted end of the tube.  This droplet is called a 
pollination droplet and it serves as a receptacle for 
airborne pollen (Pater 1991).

' WHERE symbol='epvi';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Adaptation: Green ephedra is tolerant of calcareous, 
weakly saline, and slightly saline-alkaline (sodic) 
sites and it is sometimes found growing in clayey 
soils.  It thrives in dry, well-drained sites and it is 
intolerant of wet sites and poor drainage.  The plant is 
drought-resistant, markedly so after initial seedling 
establishment.  Local plant materials are winter-
hardy.  Distant southern or lower altitude seed 
sources may be frost-sensitive, especially in the 
seedling stage.  Ephedra sites are not commonly 
burned due to sparse, discontinuous fuels but some 
plants survive wildfire and spread by roots.  Green 
ephedra is more vigorous in full sunlight but it also 
grows in partial shade of open woodlands.  Plants are 
weakly competitive due to slow growth rate 
compatible with other shrubs and herbs, but more so 
after seedlings are firmly established (Pater 1991). 
 
General: Harvest the seeds by knocking them from 
the shrubs into containers or onto a dry, clean canvas 
using an office clipper seed separator.  A Shop-Vac 
vacuum cleaner also has potential as a harvesting 
tool.  Seed quality is not standardized.  There is 90% 
purity, about 60% germination, 54% Pure Live Seed 
(PLS), and an estimated 25,000 seeds per pound 
(Pater 1991). 
 
Propogration by seed: Plant seed 1 to 2 cm deep. 
preferably by drilling in a well prepared, firm 
seedbed.  Always mix the seeds with other species 
when re-vegetating game ranges to help control 
weeds and counterbalance slow rates of growth and 
establishment.  One-half to one pound per acre of 
seed is used in 17 to 19 and 28 to 30 pounds per acre 
total seed mixes when drilling and broadcasting, 
respectively.  Seeding can be sown by airplane on 
disked or plowed lands or such seeded areas can be 
anchor-chained when no site preparation proceeds 
seeding.  Plant before the growing season with soil 
moisture most dependably adequate for good 
germination and seedling establishment.  Seedings 
are made in late fall, early winter, or spring in 
intermountain areas (Pater 1991). 
 
About half of the seed will germinate in 5 to 12 days, 
and most germination is completed in 14 days in lab 
tests.  Alternating 59 degree F to 87 degrees F (15.0-
30.5 degrees C) day and 36 degrees F to 41 degrees F 

Page 3
(2.2-5.0 degrees C) night temperatures are optimal 
for germinating seed.  Constant 55 degrees F (12.7 
degrees C) also gave good germination.  Germination 
may be improved by an after ripening period.  
Results from Utah game range revegetation 
evaluations suggest seedling vigor and growth rate 
are rather weak. plants take five to ten years to attain 
two foot heights.  Germination was reduced in -4 to -
16 bars osmotic potential solutions. optimum was 0 
to -4 bars (Pater 1991).

Choctaw used the plant to treat gonorrhea.  The 
Alabama and Koasati tribes used the plant 
ceremonially as well as medicinally.  The Koasati 
believed the plant to contain magical powers, which 
could kill an enemy merely by striking him with it.  
The roots are collected in the autumn.  Some Native 
Americans still use the plant today. 
  
Other: The unique shape and color of 
rattlesnakemaster flower sprays make them an 
unusual addition to fresh and dried flower 
arrangements.  For best results, cut the flowers before 
they open completely.

General: Carrot or parsley family (Apiaceae, 
formerly Umbelliferae).  These hardy, perennial or 
biennial herbs, resembling a cross between a yucca 
and a thistle, can be a little over a meter to two 
meters tall.  The solitary, erect stem has parallel ribs 
and branches near the top, ending in globe-shaped 
flowers.  The stem has alternate leaves, which are 
narrow, lance-shaped and pinnately veined.  The 
broad, stiff basal leaves (20-90cm long, 9cm wide), 
are usually absent at the time of flowering.  Leaves 
can be slightly toothed along the edges.  The plants 
flower from spring to fall.  The white to blue flower 
heads are 1-1.5 cm with 2mm-long flower petals.  
Spiny, bluish, leaflike bracts extend beyond the 
flowering heads giving them an unusual appearance.  
Fruits are short and oblong, from 2 to 4mm, with 
scales.

tea, decoction, or poultice.  The flowers and the 
bitter, aromatic leaves may be used fresh or dried.  
The leaves and flowers were made into a “bitter or 
sweetish-soapy” tasting tea that was drunk to relieve 
headaches and other symptoms of tuberculosis.  
Infusions of Yerba santa leaves and flowers were 
used to treat fevers, coughs, colds, stomachaches 
asthma, rheumatism pleurisy, and to purify the blood.  
The Kawaiisu drank Yerba Santa tea instead of water 
for a month to treat gonorrhea (Zigmond 1981).  The 
Salinan used an infusion of the leaves as a balm for 
the eyes.  Later, those at the San Antonio mission 
made eye balm by placing the leaves in corked glass 
bottles and allowing them to sweat in the sun.   
 
Leaves were smoked or chewed to relieve asthma, 
coughs, colds, headaches, and stomachaches.  Heated 
leaves were placed on the forehead to relieve 
headaches (Bocek 1984) and other aches and sores 
(Barrett &amp. Gifford 1933).  The sticky leaves 
conveniently stay in place upon the skin.  Mashed 
leaves were applied externally to sores, cuts, wounds, 
and aching muscles.  Mashed leaves were also used 
to reduce the swelling and relieve pain caused by 
bone fractures (Barrett &amp. Gifford 1933).  Yerba 
Santa, used alone or combined with other herbs, was 
applied to infected sores on humans and animals.  
The branches and leaves were burned in steam baths 
to treat rheumatism.  The Ohlone wove the leaves 
into skirts and aprons.   
 
Wildlife: Bees visit the flowers of Yerba Santa, which 
make a deliciously spicy amber honey.  Seedlings 
and young plants are relatively nutritious and 
palatable but the bitter compounds in mature Yerba 
Santa shrubs discourage most large herbivores.  
However it is an important forage crop for black-
tailed deer in the winter when other food sources are 
unavailable.  Birds and small mammals eat the seed 
capsules.   
 
Livestock: Goats will sometimes eat the leaves and 
stems.  Cattle will avoid Yerba Santa in favor of 
more palatable plants, which can be a problem in 
highly grazed areas where it can become the 
dominant plant (Howard 1992).   
 
Other: Yerba Santa can be used for rehabilitating and 
stabilizing disturbed areas (Howard 1992).  The seeds 
germinate readily in disturbed soils.  The shallow, 
spreading root system can help to stabilize areas 
subject to erosion caused by runoff.

Ethnobotanic: Yerba Santa was highly valued by 
many California tribes including the Salinan, Ohlone, 
Miwok, Pomo, and Yokuts who continue to use it for 
various medicinal purposes.  The Spanish who came 
to early California were so impressed with the plant 
that they gave it the name Yerba Santa, meaning holy 
plant.  Yerba Santa was introduced to the Spanish 
Padres at Mission San Antonio de Padua by the 
Salinan tribe and it became one of three major 
medicinal herbs used at the mission (Heinsen 1972).   
 
The plants can be harvested at any stage, but are best 
in the fall when the leaves are sticky and aromatic 
(Hedges &amp. Beresford 1986).  The Kashaya Pomo 
recommend gathering the leaves just before the plant 
begins to produce flowers (Goodrich et al. 1980).

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_='Description 
General: Waterleaf family (Hydrophyllaceae).  Yerba 
Santa is a perennial evergreen shrub (5 to 22 dm) 
native to California and Oregon.  The stems are black 
with shredding outer bark.  The lance shaped leaves 
(4 to 15cm long) are thick and leathery with a 
glutinous upper surface.  The leaves are dark green 
above with lighter green beneath and can have either 
smooth or saw-toothed edges.  Older leaves often 
turn black due to a condition called sooty fungus.  
The white to purple trumpet-shaped flowers (8 to 
17mm) grow in branched panicles at the stem ends.  
The flowers bloom from May to June or July.  The 
small capsulate fruits (2-3mm) ripen in September 
and contain from 2 to 20 small black seeds.   
 
Distribution: Yerba Santa occurs from the Coast 
Ranges in California from Monterey County to the 
Klamath range in Siskiyou County as well as in the 
Sierra Nevada Range from Kern County in California 
to the Oregon counties of Klamath and Jackson in the 
north (Howard 1992).  For current distribution, please 
consult the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site.   
 
Habitat: Yerba Santa grows below 1600-m elevation 
on dry rocky hillsides and ridges.  It can be found in 
patches on chaparral slopes, forests, canyons, and 
along riverbanks.  It is abundant in some annual 
grasslands and oak woodlands.  Yerba Santa is often 
found in disturbed areas and early to mid 
successional communities.

climate of California.  Yerba Santa is a “fire-
following” species (Emery 1988).  Seeds stored in the 
soil for decades germinate readily during the first 
spring after a fire (Howard 1992).  Older plants can 
sprout from their underground stems, called 
rhizomes, following disturbances such as fire.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Gather seeds in September and October as the fruit 
capsules ripen.  Yerba Santa seeds can be planted in 
the fall or early spring.  The seeds will store 
indefinitely if kept in a dry, cool location.  Prior to 
sowing, mix the seeds with several parts of moist 
 
 
sand.  This helps to ensure even distribution.  Seeds 
can be sown directly into a prepared bed or into flats 
filled with a mixture of equal amounts of soil, sand, 
and leafmold.  Heating the seeds in an oven for 5 
minutes at 194 °F may increase germination rates 
(Emery 1988).  Alternatively the seed coat can be 
scarified in order to allow moisture and air to enter 
(Mirov &amp. Kraebel 1939).  This may be accomplished 
by rubbing the seeds between two pieces of 
sandpaper.  Adding charate (burned and ground plant 
stems) to the soil may also increase germination 
success.  When the seedlings are large enough to 
handle they should be transplanted into larger pots.  
The plants can be placed into the ground the 
following spring.   
 
The plants are sunloving and do not tolerate shade.  
Plants may be grown in any texture of soil but prefer 
it to be slightly acidic and moderately fertile.  The 
shallow roots allow them to establish in thin as well 
as deep soils.  The plants are tolerant of serpentine 
soils.   
 
When selecting a site keep in mind that after two 
years Yerba Santa can reproduce vegetablely through 
rhizomes.  These underground stems can spread as 
much as 2.5 m in one year under excellent conditions 
(Howard 1992) and may overrun other plants (Halse 
1993).  This vegetative spread results in cloned 
patches with plants spaced from 20 to 25cm apart.

and inflammation of the nose and throat.  The tea was 
used to break fevers. The plant was boiled and mixed 
with tallow to make a balm that could be spread upon 
sores on the skin.  It was used for as an eye medicine 
to treat “dimness of sight.”  It was used as an 
astringent, a diuretic, and as an aid for kidneys or the 
gout.  The Cherokee and Houma tribes boiled the 
roots to make a drink for “menstruation troubles” and 
to induce miscarriages (to treat “suppressed 
menstruation”).  It was also used to treat hemorrhages 
and for spitting of blood.  The Catawba used a drink

and stems can be sparsely pubescent to quite hairy. 
The genus name, Erigeron stems from the Greek eri, 
&quot.early&quot. and geron &quot.old man,&quot. probably because of the 
plant’s hairy appearance.  The common name 
“fleabane” is from Old English and it refers to the 
plant’s odor, which supposedly can repel fleas. 
Similar species: Erigeron pulchellus has fewer ray 
flowers (40-60).  E. quercifolius is shorter with violet 
or blue flowers.  E. strigosus is an annual from 30-
90cm tall, which lacks the clasping leaves 
surrounding the stem.  Low Erigeron (E. pumilis 
Nutt.) is from 5-30cm tall and can have white, pink, 
or bluish rays. 
 
Distribution: For current distribution, please consult

like grains of rice.  The bulbs grow relatively close to 
the surface and are easily extracted.  Bulbs were dug 
in spring (before flowering) or in summer or fall 
(after flowering) using a digging stick, a wooden 
spade, or the fingers.  Chocolate lily bulbs were 
cooked immediately, or could be partially dried, then 
stored in a cool place for winter use.  They were 
cooked for about 30 minutes in a cedarwood box, by 
boiling for a short time then mashing to a paste, or 
occasionally, by baking in ashes.  Chocolate lily 
bulbs were used as an item of trade.  Even when 
cooked, they are slightly bitter, and some people used 
to soak them in water overnight to reduce the bitter 
flavor.  In Fritillaria species, the major carbohydrate 
is reported to be starch (Yuanovsky and Kingsbury 
1938).

This plant tolerates shade, but prefers sun.  It may be

Fritillaria species are frequently found in areas with 
soil moisture persisting throughout most of the 
growing season.  Fritillaria propagates readily from 
seed, and the rice-like bulblets can be used for 
propagation.  This species grows well in well-
drained, loam soils that are neutral to slightly acid. 
 
' WHERE symbol='fraf2';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_LivePlant_bulb_Cultivation TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_LivePlant_bulb_Cultivation='Fritillaria species have bulbs that do well in moist 
shade.  Bulbs may be planted in pots or in a 
greenhouse bed or bulb frame.  It is best to store 
Fritillaria bulbs in slightly moist bark, peat, shredded 
wood, or some other material.  Buy the bulbs as early 
as possible before they begin to grow.  Bulbs tend to 
deteriorate or rot if kept too long. 
 
Plant bulbs in soil that is rich in nutrients and humus 
and also retains moisture.  Incorporate plenty of leafy 
mold or some other organic matter, such as well-
rotted manure or compost, before planting.  Acid-
loving woodland bulbs thrive in the peat garden 
where at least half the soil is leaf mold, peat, or 
compost. 
 
Bulbs in containers should not be allowed to dry out 
when in growth and should be fed regularly with a 
high-potassium fertilizer to boost flower production.  
Wait until seeds have set and foliage begins to 
senesce before lifting bulbs out of soil, clean them, 
and store them in a cool, moist place.  Watch bulbs to 
prevent them from rotting or being affected by a 
fungal disease.   
 
Bulbs can increase naturally by forming bulblets 
around the bulb (the “rice” in “Indian rice”). 
Propagate the bulbs by separating these bulblets from 
the mother bulb and planting.  Bulbs should be 
separated every year or two.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_SeedCultivation TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_SeedCultivation='This species grows readily from seed.  Most bulbs 
take 3-5 years to reach mature flowering stage.  
Fritillaria species do not flower regularly even in 
nature, and so are described as shy-flowering.  When 
seed capsules form, they begin to split when they are 
ripe.  Collect immediately, as seeds may be shed 
quickly.  Let the seeds dry without heat, and store 
them until sown in labeled paper packets in a cool, 
dry, airy place.  Do not use plastic bags, as the seeds 
are likely to rot. 
 
 
 
The best times to sow seeds are fall, but if seed is 
available earlier, sow immediately.  Germination 
should follow in early spring. 
 
The recommended potting soil for seed germination 
and emergence is a commercial sand-based mix. with 
one-quarter part coarse sand added if the mixture 
does not have a sandy appearance.  Space large, flat 
seeds of Fritillaria one seed’s width apart.  Sieve a 
light covering of the soil mix over the seeds so that 
they are no longer visible, and then cover with a 
generous layer of grit or aquarium gravel.  Label the 
pots with the plant name, seed source, and date.  
Stand the pots in a shady place in the open garden, or 
plunge them in a sand frame, and keep them moist. 
 
When the seedlings have germinated, bring the pots 
into full light in a cold frame or greenhouse.  Keep 
them moist until they show definite signs of dying 
down, and then water them very sparingly.  
Fritillaria seedlings should be kept slightly moist 
during this senescent period.  Start watering again in 
early fall, or as soon as there is new growth, and keep 
the pots watered until the growth dies down.  Leave 
most bulbs for two growing seasons before repotting, 
unless they grow vigorously.  Larger bulbs are 
formed if these seedlings are fed the second year.  
Use a commercial liquid feed as used for tomatoes, 
but at half the manufacturer’s recommended strength.  
After two years, remove the bulbs from the pots after 
they have died back.  Separate out the bulblets, clean 
them gently, and repot them in clean, moist soil.  For 
Fritillaria species, use a soil mix of one part 
sterilized leaf mold, one part peat or compost, and 
one part sterilized soil, with a further 1.5 parts of 
coarse horticultural sand or seed-grown perlite.  It is 
better to grow seedlings in pots for 3-4 years before 
planting them outside.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Uses='White ash is a good tree for open areas such as parks 
and campuses. it also is used as a lawn, shade, and 
street tree, even though its potential large size can 
make it incongruous with a small area.  It is an erect, 
graceful tree, often with bronze-purple fall foliage.  It 
is easy to transplant and numerous cultivars have 
been developed, including seedless (male) forms.  
Other selections are based on yellow to orange and 
purple fall colors, persistence of leaves in the fall, 
height, crown shape (broadly to narrowly oval) and 
density, growth vigor, and cold hardiness.  White ash 
also has been used in re-vegetating disturbed sites.   
The wood of white ash is valued for its strength, 
hardness, heavy weight, and elasticity (shock 
resistance).  Native Americans appreciated its 
usefulness for tools and implements, and it is used 
extensively today for tool handles.  Its use in wooden 
baseball bats is famous.  The wood is also used in 
furniture, doors, veneer, antique vehicle parts, 
railroad cars and ties, canoe paddles, snowshoes, 
boats, posts, ties, and fuel.  White ash is the most 
valuable timber tree of the various ashes.   
White ash was used by Native Americans for a 
variety of medicinal purposes: a decoction of the 
leaves as a laxative and general tonic for women after 
childbirth. the seeds as an aphrodisiac, a diuretic, an 
appetite stimulant, a styptic, an emetic, and as a cure 
for fevers. and a bark tea for an itching scalp, lice, 
snakebite, and other sores.  Juice from the leaves has 
been applied to mosquito bites for relief of swelling 
and itching.    
White-tailed deer and cattle browse white ash and 
beaver, porcupine, and rabbits may eat the bark of 
young trees.  The seeds are eaten by wood duck, 
northern bobwhite, turkey, grouse, finches, 
grosbeaks, cardinals, fox squirrel, mice, and many 
other birds and small mammals.  The tendency of 
white ash to form trunk cavities makes it valuable for 
cavity nesters such as redheaded, red-bellied, and 
pileated woodpeckers.  Once primary nest excavators 
have opened up the bole, it is an excellent habitat for 
secondary nesters such as wood ducks, owls, 
nuthatches, and gray squirrels.

furrow pattern.  Leaves are deciduous, opposite, 
pinnately compound, 20-38 cm long, leaflets usually 
7(5-9), short-stalked, ovate to ovate-lanceolate or 
elliptic, acuminate, 6-13 cm long and 3-6 cm wide, 
sometimes with a few teeth near the tip, dark green 
and smooth above, whitish below.  Flowers are 
numerous, very small, green to purplish, in small 
branched clusters near the branch tips, usually either 
male (staminate) or female (pistillate), a single tree 
usually bearing only one sex (the species dioecious). 
Fruits are samaras 2.5-5 cm long, hanging in clusters, 
with a narrow wing extending about 1/3-1/4 of the 
way down the cylindrical body.  The common name 
is in reference to the white color of the wood.   
This species flowers in April-May, the male first, 
before appearance of the leaves. fruiting August-
October, the seeds dispersed September-November.  
The pollen is already airborne during the 7-10 days 
when the female flowers are receptive. 
Variation within the species: A number of variants 
have been described within the species, including F. 
americana var. biltmoreana (Beadle) J. Wright ex 
Fern. (= F. biltmoreana Beadle) and F. americana 
var. microcarpa A. Gray, but the distinctions 
between these have not been generally confirmed and 
formal variants are not currently recognized. 
Diploids (2n=46), tetraploids (2n=92), and 
hexaploids (2n=138) occur within the species, but it 
is difficult to associate differences in ploidy level 
with other patterns of variation.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Distribution TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Distribution='White ash grows over most of eastern North 
America, absent only from the outer Atlantic and 
Gulf coastal plains.  It occurs from Nova Scotia west 
to eastern Minnesota and south to Texas and northern 
Florida, northward barely into southern Quebec and 
Ontario.  It is cultivated in Hawaii.  For current 
distribution, please consult the Plant Profile page for 
this species on the PLANTS Web site.  
' WHERE symbol='fram2';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Adaptation: White ash grows best on deep, well-
drained, moist soils with other hardwoods at 
elevations of about 0-1050 meters.  It rarely forms 
pure stands.  It occurs on middle slopes in the 
Northeast, on slightly elevated ridges in the 
floodplains of major streams in the coastal plain, and 
on slopes along major streams in the central states.  
Primary associates are eastern white pine, northern 
red oak, white oak, sugar maple, red maple, yellow 
birch, American beech, black cherry, eastern 
hemlock, and yellow poplar.  
White ash is primarily characteristic of early and 
intermediate stages of succession.  The seedlings are 
shade tolerant but can also establish in full sun. 
Mature individuals are shade intolerant – after 
persisting for a few years in moderately dense shade, 
trees developing inside closed stands reach the 
overstory by responding quickly to openings in the 
canopy.  
General: White ash begins producing seed at a 
minimum age of 20 years.  A good seed crop is 
produced at intervals of 2-3 years, although the males 
flower heavily each year.  To best overcome 
dormancy, stratify under moist conditions for 30 days 
at 14/30° C (night/day) then for 60 days at 5° C.  A 
forest floor seed bank may retain viable white ash 
seeds for 3-4 years.  Germination can occur on 
mineral soil, humus, or leaf litter, and seedlings 
develop best in partial sun.  Mature trees may reach 
200 years of age.   
White ash resprouts from the root crown after 
logging or fire.  Sprouting ability decreases with age.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='White ash prefers moist, deep soils for best growth 
but is adaptable to a wide range of soil pH.  Full sun 
is best.  Young plants are easily transplanted and 
established.  White ash has been successfully used in 
the reclamation of strip mines in Ohio, Kentucky, and 
Pennsylvania.  Seedlings provide a better start than 
direct seeding, and planting should be in mixtures 
with other hardwoods.  White ash is more ornamental 
than green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) but is less 
adaptable, grows at a slower rate, and is more 
susceptible to pests and diseases.  
Bud grafting generally propagates white ash 
cultivars.  The species also can be propagated by 
conventional methods of grafting and layering. open 
field and bench grafting of unpotted stock have been 
successful.   
Fire kills the aboveground stem and crown of white 
ash, but it resprouts from the root crown after fire. 
White ash is moderately susceptible to decay and 
insect damage induced through fire damage.

decline is thought to result from multiple causes – 
MLO plus various fungi and viruses, as well as 
atmospheric pollution and drought.  Maintenance of 
good tree vigor is the primary control 
recommendation.   
White ash is sensitive to ozone, sulfur dioxide, 
nitrous oxides, and associated acid deposition, which 
may cause the appearance of necrotic lesions on the 
leaves.  Most of recent ash decline has occurred in 
areas with high levels of these gases.

clustered rice-like bulblets.  The stems are 20-50 cm 
tall, sturdy and unbranched, bearing 1-3 whorls of 5-
11 lance-shaped leaves.  The flowers of Indian rice 
are bell-shaped and nodding, each with greenish-
brown to brownish- purple tepals, sometimes 
streaked with yellow.  The flowers have a 
disagreeable odor.  The capsules are angled and many 
seeded.  The species are attractive in native garden,

uncommon in the wild.  In addition, salt marsh, 
estuarine wetland, and freshwater wetland habitat has 
declined by over 90 percent throughout much of the 
United States.  Wild harvesting for non-traditional 
use should be restricted to salvage sites with 
appropriate approvals and permits.  
 
Fritillaria species are frequently found in areas with 
soil moisture persisting throughout most of the 
growing season.  It is often found on coarse-grained 
soils of glacial origin.  Riceroot tolerates shade, but 
prefers sun.  Fritillaria propagates readily from seed, 
and the rice-like bulblets can be used for propagation.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_LivePlant_Bulb_Cultivation TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_LivePlant_Bulb_Cultivation='Fritillaria species have bulbs that do well in moist 
shade.  Bulbs may be planted in pots or in a 
greenhouse bed or bulb frame.  It is best to store 
Fritillaria bulbs in slightly moist bark, peat, shredded 
wood, or some other material.  Buy the bulbs as early 
as possible before they begin to grow.  Bulbs tend to 
deteriorate or rot if kept too long. 
 
Plant bulbs in soil that is rich in nutrients and humus 
and also retains moisture.  Incorporate plenty of leafy 
mold or some other organic matter, such as well-
rotted manure or compost, before planting.  Acid-
loving woodland bulbs thrive in the peat garden, 
where at least half the soil is leaf mold, peat, or 
compost. 
 
Bulbs in containers should not be allowed to dry out 
when growing and should be fed regularly with a 
high-potassium fertilizer to boost flower production.  
Wait until seeds have set and foliage begins to 
senesce before lifting bulbs out of soil, then clean 
them and store them in a cool, moist place.  Watch 
bulbs to prevent them from rotting or being affected 
by a fungal disease.   
 
Bulbs can increase naturally by forming bulblets 
around the bulb (the “rice” in “Indian rice”).  
Propagate the bulbs by separating these bulblets from 
the mother bulb and planting them.  Bulbs should be 
separated every year or two.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_SeedPropagation TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_SeedPropagation='This species grows readily from seed.  Most bulbs 
take 3-5 years to reach mature flowering stage.  
Fritillaria species do not flower regularly even in 
nature, and so are described as “shy-flowering.”  
Collect seed immediately when capsules are ripe, as 
they split and seeds may be shed quickly.  Let the 
seeds dry without heat, and store them until sown in 
labeled paper packets in a cool, dry, airy place.  Do 
not use plastic bags, as the seeds are likely to rot. 
 
The best times to sow seeds are fall, but if seed is 
available earlier, sow immediately.  Germination 
should follow in early spring. 
 
The recommended potting soil for seed germination 
and emergence is a commercial sand-based mix. with 
one-quarter part coarse sand added if the mixture 
does not have a sandy appearance.  Space large, flat 
seeds of Fritillaria one seed’s width apart.  Sieve a 
light covering of the soil mix over the seeds so that 
 
 
they are no longer visible and then cover with a 
generous layer of grit or aquarium gravel.  Label the 
pots with the plant name, seed source, and date.  
Stand the pots in a shady place in the open garden, or 
plunge them in a sand frame, and keep them moist. 
 
When the seedlings have germinated, bring the pots 
into full light in a cold frame or greenhouse.  Keep 
them moist until they show definite signs of dying 
down, and then water them very sparingly.  
Fritillaria seedlings should be kept slightly moist 
during this senescent period.  Start watering again in 
early fall, or as soon as there is new growth, and keep 
the pots watered until the growth dies down.  Leave 
most bulbs for two growing seasons before repotting, 
unless they grow vigorously.  Larger bulbs are 
formed if these seedlings are fed the second year.  
Use a commercial liquid feed as used for tomatoes, 
but at half the manufacturer’s recommended strength.  
After two years, remove the bulbs from the pots after 
they have died back.  Separate out the bulblets, clean 
them gently, and repot them in clean, moist soil.  For 
Fritillaria species, use a soil mix of one part 
sterilized leaf mold, one part peat or compost, and 
one part sterilized soil, with a further 1.5 parts of 
coarse horticultural sand or seed-grown perlite.  It is 
better to grow seedlings in pots for 3-4 years before 
planting them outside.

Uses 
Ethnobotanic: The bark is cut at one end of the 
branches and peeled off in long strips.  These are 
washed and rubbed between the hands.  Three strands 
are rolled together on the upper thigh to make 
cordage a type of string or rope that was made into a 
pack strap and tumpline by the Kawaiisu.  The wood 
was also sometimes substituted for willow in the 
making of Kawaiisu baby cradles.  The inner bark 
was soaked in water and the infusion drank as a 
physic by the Kawaiisu.  Many other California tribes 
utilized the bark for cordage including the Owens 
Valley Paiute, Sierra Miwok, Western Mono, and 
Tubatulabal.  The Sierra Miwok made a hoop of the 
bark wrapped with buckskin for the hoop and pole 
game.  The Tubatulabal used rope made of 
flannelbush to lash bundles of tules together for a 
raft, to tie up crooks on pinyon staves, to bundle 
firewood into a load, and for two ends of a pack 
strap.  The Western Mono used the young split 
branches to tie together their looped stirring sticks 
and to assemble different types of cone-shaped 
storage bins for acorns and manzanita berries.

The plants grow in extremely rocky areas and are 
often found in crevices of rocks.  In southern 
California, these plants are found in areas containing 
very gritty soil and low rainfall.  Buy small seedlings 
and plant them in the fall in a pile of roadfill with no 
clay (mostly gravel and rock and very little soil).  
Plant the seedlings in mounds in full sun.  Plant in 
shallow holes and make sure that no soil covers the 
top of the ball of soil that contains the seedlings.  
Cover the soil with gravel and rock, then water.  
Keep the mound moist until new growth is several 
inches long (not over 4 inches), then stop watering.  
Water at the edge of the mound making sure that the 
water doesn t get within fifteen inches of the trunk of 
the plant.  Leave the shrub alone from then on and 
use no fertilizer.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='You can prune this shrub at any time of the year.  
Tribes in the Sierra Nevada burned individual shrubs 
or areas where the shrubs grew in the fall or winter to 
induce rapid elongation of young epicormic branches 
which were harvested and split for cordage.

flavor.  It was gathered and eaten raw by the Makah, 
Quileute, and Quinault of western Washington.  It 
was also harvested for its fruit by the native peoples 
of Alaska and coastal British Columbia.  The Wiyot, 
Pomo, and other tribes in California savored the 
fruits.  The plant is also used medicinally by the 
Quileute by chewing the leaves and spitting them on 
burns. 
 
Wildlife: The Portola wood rat and the valley quail 
eat the fruit and leaves of wild strawberries.

BLACK ASH 
Fraxinus nigra Marsh. 
Plant Symbol = FRNI 
 
Contributed By: USDA NRCS National Plant Data 
Center &amp. the Biota of North America Program 
darker colored with more grain and used largely for 
furniture and interior finish.   
 
 
Ethnobotanic: Black ash is an important tree for the 
making of lacrosse sticks used by the Mohawk and 
other tribes of the Eastern United States.  Trunks at 
least 6 to 8 inches across are harvested for their bark.  
The Abnaki, Ojibwa, Malecite, Meskwaki, and other 
cultural groups use the bark to make baskets.  The 
inner bark of the black ash was used to make a bark 
barrel by the Iroquois which was used for storing 
dried vegetables, fruits, and seeds, as well as 
clothing.  The tree traditionally was a valuable 
medicine to many tribes in Eastern North America.  
The Iroquois steeped the bark of the tree together 
with the roots and bark of other plants to treat 
rheumatism.  The Menomini used the inner bark of 
the trunk as a valuable medicine and as a seasoner for 
other medicines.  The Meskwaki made a tea from a 
mixture of the wood with the root of Smilacina 
racemosa to loosen the bowels.  They also used the 
inner bark of the trunk as a remedy for any internal 
ailments.  Non-Indian settlers used a bark infusion as 
a bitter tonic. 
 
Black ash is not an outstanding ornamental, but it is 
cold tolerant, good for wet soils, and relatively 
tolerant of atmospheric pollution.  Cultivars and 
hybrids have been developed, emphasizing upright 
growth, oval crown form, growth vigor, bright yellow 
fall foliage, persistence of fall foliage, and 
seedlessness.   
 
Wildlife: The winged seeds are eaten by a number of 
birds including wood ducks, quail, bobwhite, purple 
finches, and pine grosbeaks.  Mammals also eat the 
seeds including beaver, porcupines, and white-footed 
mice.  Rodents and sometimes wild turkeys shuck off 
the wing and eat only the seed inside.  White-tailed 
deer and moose feed on the twigs and foliage.

corky-ridged and shallowly furrowed, divided into 
large irregular plates with thin, papery scales that rub 
off easily.  Leaves are deciduous, opposite, 15-40 cm 
long, pinnately compound with 7-11 oval to lance-
shaped leaflets each 8-14 cm long, tapered to a long 
slender tip, only the end leaflet stalked, with finely 
toothed margins, dark green above, lighter green 
beneath with some rusty hairs, turning purple to 
brown in the fall.  Flowers are small, purplish, 
usually in clusters near the branch tips. some trees 
produce either male flowers or female flowers, but 
others have a mixture of the two kinds while others 
have bisexual flowers (the species polygamo-
dioecious).  Fruits are winged nutlets (samaras) 2-4.5 
cm long and 1cm wide, winged to the base, borne in 
terminal or axillary clusters, the cluster hanging at 
maturity.   The common name is perhaps in reference 
to the dark wood. the other common names are 
clearer in allusion.    
  
Variation within the species: Variants have not 
generally been recognized within black ash.    
 
Distribution: Black ash is native to the Great Lakes 
and Acadia regions of North America, in 
southeastern Canada from Newfoundland to eastern 
Manitoba, south to Iowa, Illinois, West Virginia, and 
Virginia.  For current distribution, please consult the 
Plant Profile page for this species on the PLANTS 
Web site.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Adaptation TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Adaptation='Black ash most commonly grows in moist to wet 
muck or shallow organic soils, especially in swamps, 
floodplains, terraces, ravines, and on small, poorly 
drained upland pockets.  It also may grow on sands 
and loams with high water tables.  It can tolerate 
standing water for many weeks, but best growth is on 
better-drained sites.   
 
It is a shade intolerant pioneer species and normally 
becomes established in even-aged pockets or stands 
following some kind of disturbance.  Seedlings, 
saplings, and sprouts tend to dominate the 
regeneration layer under partial openings in the 
canopy.  It sometimes occurs in pure stands, 
especially on wetter upland sites, but usually is mixed 
with eastern white cedar, tamarack, black spruce, 
balsam fir, American elm, red maple, and silver 
maple.  It is also may be sparsely present in mature 
forests dominated by larch, birch, and even beech-
maple.   
 
Flowering: May-June, with the leaves or just before. 
fruiting: June-September dispersed: July-October.   
  
' WHERE symbol='frni';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Adaptation: The habitat of the tree is in wet woods 
and swamps and it occurs in Delaware, West 
Virginia, Indiana and Iowa, north into the Canadian 
provinces of Newfoundland, Quebec, and Manitoba. 
 
Planting: Black ash is difficult to grow.  Good seed 
crops in black ash are produced irregularly (1-8 year 
intervals).  Seeds may remain dormant for up to 8 
years under natural conditions.  Most do not 
germinate until the second spring after being 
released.  The seed can germinate in hardwood leaf 
litter or under 0.6-1.8 centimeters of soil.  Grass, 
brush, and hardwood reproduction must be controlled 
for successful seedling establishment. 
 
Ash fruits are usually gathered in the autumn when 
their color has faded from green to yellow or brown.  
Clusters should be collected by hand or with pruners 
and seed hooks or gathered from the ground.  
Samaras should be spread in shallow layers for 
complete drying.  Plant the seeds in the fall of the 
year, one-half inch below the surface of the soil 
through drilling or broadcasting.  No stratification 
methods appear to work.  Some recommend 
stratifying seeds 60 days at 14/30 C° (night/day), then 
90 days at 5° C.  Otherwise, stored seeds are best 
sown as soon as possible in a cold frame or an 
outdoor seedbed.  In direct planting of the seed, one 
must be patient as it may take two winters before the 
seeds to germinate.  During this time, keep the soil 
moist during the growing season.  The seeds usually 
germinate the second spring--and after germination 
the seedlings grow rapidly, up to one foot per year.  
 
Shade the beds for a short time after germination.  
Keep the bed weed-free even though the seeds 
haven t germinated.  Mulching with wood chips, 
straw, or burlap helps keep down the weeds.  Also, 
the area needs to be deer-proofed, as the deer like to 
browse the young seedlings.  At the end of the second 
year out-plant the seedlings during the spring, while 
they still are dormant.  The soil should have good 
drainage and no standing water.  The plants need full 
sunlight.  Space the plants 4 to 8 feet apart.  After 
out-planting, no care is needed.  Pruning may be 
required to keep straight stems for certain 
ethnobotanical purposes. 
 
Older trees of black ash are known to have reached 
130 years, but older ones probably exist.

Black ash produces fast-growing sprouts from stumps 
up to 30 cm in diameter.  Sprouts originate from 
adventitious buds on the sides of the stump and at the 
root crown.  Trees also will root sucker.

inadequate natural regeneration or loss of advanced 
regeneration because of rising water tables or 
increased competition with grass and brush.   
 
As with many other tree species on wet sites, 
individuals of black ash are shallowly rooted and 
subject to windthrow.   
 
Black ash is easily damaged by fire and can be killed 
or top-killed by severe fire but it probably sprouts 
from the root crown following such damage.  Burned 
sites also may be re-colonized through the wind-
dispersed seed.

are bushy and branch upwards from the woody base. 
The non-woody stems range from smooth to having 
some short hairs.  The stems may be resinous and 
therefore sticky when touched.  The leaves are 
alternate and range from linear to linear and 
threadlike in shape.  The leaves are from 5 to 60 mm 
long and 1 to 3 mm wide.  Dense clusters of flowers 
form at the ends of the stems.  There are 3 to 8 ray 
florets per cluster and 2 to 6 disk florets per cluster.  
The flattened part of the ray corolla or ligule is 
yellow in color and 1 to 3 mm long.  The whorl of 
bracts that is found at the base of the flower cluster is 
3 to 6 mm tall and 2 mm across.  The bracts are 
narrow and green in color at the apex and along the 
midnerve.  The achenes have a modified calyx 
consisting of 8 to 10 acute scales.  The acute scales of 
the ray achenes are about one-half as long as those of

general construction, cabinet work, sills, interior 
finish, fine furniture, railway sleepers, bridge 
timbers, crossties, fence posts and rails, and fuel 
wood (Table 1) and (Table2).  Fence posts may last 
for more than 50 years, although the rot resistant 
wood is soft and staples pull out easily.  Kentucky 
coffeetree lumber is available but not common.  The 
fruit is high in saponins and is used as soap.  The 
leaves have been used as a fly poison.  Due to the 
tree’s toxic plant parts such as the leaves and raw 
seeds, there is little wildlife usage as a source of 
food. 
 
Ornamental: Used for ornamental purposes in large 
area landscape plantings and parks.  In the fall, 
ripening pods contrast nicely with clear yellow fall 
foliage.  Decorative clusters of the large pods rattling 
in the wind make for an exceptional winter 
ornamental.  The species was introduced into 
cultivation before 1748.  Kentucky coffeetree has 
been slighted in the landscape industry.    
 
Ethnobotanic: While native to North America, Native 
Americans introduced the tree to some parts of the 
continent as they used the pulp from the wood to treat 
insanity.   The pulp was also used in home remedies 
to combat fever and treat headaches.  The Omahas 
mixed the bark of Kentucky coffeetree and 
gayfeather (Liatris aspera Michx.) with a pulverized 
portion of buffalo-gourd (Cucurbita foetidissima H. 
B. K.) and used it as an appetizer and tonic.  A tea 
was also made from the leaves and pulp and used as a 
laxative. Certain Indian tribes reportedly roasted the 
beans (seeds) for food.  Early settlers used the beans 
of the tree as a substitute for coffee. CAUTION! The 
seeds and pods are poisonous. ' WHERE symbol='gydi';

suggested as a possible toxin.  It can be destroyed by 
thoroughly heating the beans for at least three hours 
at 150˚C.  The beans contain saponins which are 
more toxic to fish than to other animals.  Hunting 
tribes traditionally put large quantities of the beans in 
streams and lakes to stupefy or kill fish.  
 
Pioneer settlers used the coarse-grained, light brown 
to reddish-brown wood in cabinetry.  Children used 
the beans in their games. 
 
Conservation: Kentucky coffeetree was formerly 
planted around farmsteads. It is tolerant to a wide 
range of conditions such as drought, chalk 
(limestone), and urban conditions.  The tree has been 
planted on mine spoils for soil reclamation and 
stabilization.  Due to its reasonably strong wood 
Kentucky coffeetree will tolerate some ice without 
losing branches.  This pest free tree is an alternative 
to ash and elm where they have been ravaged by 
insects and disease.

' WHERE symbol='gydi';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Description TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Description='General:  Kentucky coffeetree is the only member of 
the genus Gymnocladus native to North America.  
The word gymnocladus comes from the Greek for 
naked branch, referring to the few stout twigs, which 
are conspicuous year round.  The word dioicus relates 
to dioecious, meaning there are male and female 
trees.  The tree lies dormant for about 6 months of the 
year, thus the name Dead Tree or Stump Tree. 
 
 Although a member of the legume family 
(Fabaceae), Kentucky coffeetree is not a nitrogen 
“fixer”.  It is a medium to large, round-barked, native 
deciduous tree reaching heights of 18 to 30-m with a 
spread of 12 to 15-m.  In open areas, the tree 
produces an open, rounded crown, but in native 
woods it grows to 23-m with few branches.  Large 
specimen trees, such as Georgia’s champion tree 
stands 39.6-m tall in Pickens County, are uncommon. 
 
 
(The National Registry of Big Trees reports a 
specimen Kentucky coffeetree from Lake Co., Ohio, 
standing at 25-m with a spread of 23.5-m and a 
circumference of 5.2-m at DBH).  Kentucky 
coffeetree’s short trunk, 0.3 to 0.8-m in diameter, 
divides into several large branches that end in 
contorted, stout twigs.  Its unique, thick, dark bark is 
gray to grayish-brown, often marked with deep, 
irregular furrows and plates that curl at their sides.  
 
The alternate, bipinnately compound leaves are the 
largest of any native species, measuring from 0.3 to 
0.9-m in length by 4.6 to 6.1-dm in width, arranged 
in feather-fashion in 5 to 9 pairs of pinnae, the lowest 
are reduced to simple leaflets.  Typically the leaves 
consist of six to 14 entire. more or less ovate (almond 
shaped) leaflets, 5 to 8-cm long, acute, rounded or 
cuneate at the base, pubescent beneath when young, 
short petioled, and swollen at the base.   Leaves 
emerge late in the spring with a striking pink-bronze 
color, turning to a dark bluish-green above in 
summer.  Fall color is often a golden yellow, but the 
leaves drop early. 
  
Winter buds are small, reddish, and often placed 
above one another in close formation (superposed).  
Terminal buds are absent.  The buds are small, 
downy, almost entirely imbedded in twigs, and 
surrounded by a hairy ring of bark.   
   
The stout twigs are light brown to greenish-brown 
with whitish patches, somewhat zigzag or wavy, 
large heart shaped leaf scar, with a wide salmon-pink 
to brown colored pith.   
 
Flowering and Fruiting: The greenish-white 
dioecious or polygamo-dioecious, inconspicous 
flowers appear in May and June, after the leaves, and 
are borne in terminal racemose clusters. The fruit is a 
tardily dehiscent, flat, thick, woody legume that 
ripens in September or October and usually persists 
unopened on the tree until late winter or early spring. 
The dark brown or red brown pod is 15 to 25-cm 
long, 2.5 to 5-cm wide, and usually contains 4 to 8 
olive-green or dark brown to almost black seed 
separated by a mass of brown pulp. 
Wood Characteristics: The wood is of heavy density 
(specific gravity of 0.53 green, 0.60 dry) with a 
coarse, straight grain. Its sapwood is narrow and 
yellowish white and the heartwood is light red to red 
or reddish brown.  It is without characteristic odor or 
taste.  Growth rings are conspicuously ring porous, 
resembling ash, honeylocust (Gleditsia triacanthos 
L.) or sassafras [Sassafras albidum (Nutt.) Nees.].  
The wood is frequently confused with that of honey

Distribution: Kentucky coffeetree is uncommon in its 
native habitat.  It can only be found in small colonies 
in temperate forests.  The natural range extends from 
New York and Pennsylvania west to Minnesota, 
southward to Oklahoma, and east to Kentucky and 
Tennessee (Schopmeyer, 1974). The species is also 
found in the Dakotas, Texas, Georgia, and the 
Carolinas (PLANTS Database). naturalized in 
Alabama, West Virginia, Virginia, and Delaware 
(Steyermark, 1975). It is believed to have been 
introduced into some areas by Native Americans.  
For current distribution, please consult the Plant 
Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
site. 
 
Habitat: Kentucky coffeetree grows in moist soils in 
bottom-land woods or rocky open wooded hillsides 
with other hardwood trees.  It is commonly found on 
limestone soils and seldom found on unglaciated 
sites.  The tree occurs sometimes in small colonies of 
rather widely separated individuals resulting from 
root suckers.  Kentucky coffeetree can be found 
growing in association with sweetgum, tupelo, oaks, 
 
 
and hickories, also black walnut, basswood, elm, and 
pawpaw in temperate forests.

The leaves, seeds and pulp are poisonous and are 
toxic to livestock, humans, and pets.  Sprouts eaten in 
the spring have produced toxicosis.  Leaves, young 
sprouts, and seeds with gelatinous mater around them 
contain the toxin.  Cattle have reportedly died after 
drinking from pools of water contaminated by fallen 
leaves and seeds from the tree.  There is at least one 
anecdotal report of a human poisoning by Kentucky 
coffeetree. 
 
Clinical Signs:  “Clinical signs include rapid onset 
(within 1 hour) of intense gastrointestinal irritation, 
profuse diarrhea and straining, vomiting, 
hypertension, bradycardia, respiratory depression, 
muscle paralysis, and convulsions.  Animals often 
display depression.  Death usually occurs within a

hard pods are produced that abscise differentially 
from late fall into winter.  The flat pods range in size 
from 13 to 25-cm long and 4 to 5-cm wide.  Pods 
may be collected from the ground and run through 
some type of flail device to expose the seeds.  The

sunflowers were tall and in full bloom, the buffaloes 
were fat and the meat good” (Gilmore 1977). 
 
Helianthus seeds were eaten by many California 
natives, and often ground up and mixed with other 
seeds in pinole (Strike 1994).  The sunflower was 
used for food in Mexico and had reputed medicinal 
value in soothing chest pains (Heiser 1976).  
Francisco Hernandez, an early Spanish explorer, 
ascribed aphrodisiac powers to the sunflower (Ibid.). 
 
Charles H. Lange, an anthropologist at the University 
of Texas, wrote that “among the Cochiti, a reliable 
‘home remedy’ for cuts and other wounds is the juice 
of freshly crushed sunflower stems.  The juice is 
smeared liberally over the wounds, bandaged, and 
invariably results in a speedy recovery, with never a 
case of infection” (Heiser 1976). 
 
According to Moerman (1986) sunflowers were used 
in the following ways: 
•  The Cherokee used an infusion of sunflower

•  The Dakota used an infusion of sunflowers for

•  The Gros Ventres, Rees, and Mandan used 
sunflowers ceremonially. oil from the seeds were 
used to lubricate or paint the face and body. 
•  The Gros Ventres, Mandan, Rees, and Hidatsa 
used sunflower seeds as a stimulant, taken on a 
war party or hunt to alleviate fatigue. 
•  The Hopi used the sunflower plant as a “spider 
medicine” and dermatological aid. 
•  The Navajo ate sunflower seeds to stimulate the

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Uses='Ethnobotanic: The sunflower is a native domesticated 
crop.  During the last 3,000 years, Indians increased 
the seed size approximately 1,000 percent.  They 
gradually changed the genetic composition of the 
plant by repeatedly selecting the largest seeds 
(Yarnell 1978). 
 
Originally cultivated by North American Indians, it 
has a long and interesting history as a food plant 
(Kindscher 1987).  Sunflower seeds were and still are 
eaten raw, roasted, cooked, dried, and ground, and 
used as a source of oil.  Flower buds were boiled.  
The roasted seeds have been used as a coffee 
substitute.  The Mescalero and Chiricahua Apache 
made extensive use of wild sunflowers.  The Hidatsa 
used wild verse cultivated sunflowers in the 
production of cooking oil because the seeds of their 
smaller flower heads produced superior oil (Wilson 
1917).  In the Northeast, sunflowers are part of the 
Onandaga (Iroquois) creation myth (Gilmore 1977).  
In the Southwest, the Hopi believe that when the 
sunflowers are numerous, it is a sign that there will 
be an abundant harvest (Whiting 1939).  In the

•  The Navaho-Kayenta used the plant for the sun

prevent prenatal infections caused by the solar

•  The Navaho-Ramah used a salve of pulverized

falling on a person and as a moxa of the pith to 
remove warts.

•  The Thompson Indians used powdered 
sunflower leaves alone or in an ointment on 
sores and swellings. 
•  The Zuni used a poultice of sunflower root to 
treat snakebite, along with much ritual and 
ceremony. 
 
Purple and black dyes extracted from wild sunflowers 
were used to dye basketry materials.  A yellow dye 
was also derived from the ray flowers.  The Hopi 
Indians grew a sunflower variety with deep purple 
achenes, and obtained a purple dye by soaking them 
in water (Heiser 1976).  The dye was used to color 
basketry or to decorate their bodies.   
The Teton Dakotas boiled flower heads from which 
the involucral bracts had been removed as a remedy 
for pulmonary troubles (Gilmore 1977).  Pawnee 
women who became pregnant while still nursing a 
child took a sunflower seed medicine to prevent 
sickness in the child (Kindscher 1992).  In the 
southwest, Zuni medicine men cured rattlesnake bites 
by chewing the fresh or dried root, then sucking the 
snakebite wound (Camazine and Bye 1980).  
 
The wild sunflower was worn in the hair of the Hopi 
Indians of Arizona during various ceremonies, and 
carved wooden sunflower disks found at a prehistoric 
site in Arizona almost certainly were employed in 
ceremonial rituals (Heiser 1976). 
 
Agricultural: Early American colonists did not 
cultivate sunflowers.  The sunflower probably went 
from Mexico to Spain, and from there to other parts 
of Europe (Heiser 1976).  The Russians developed 
the Mammoth Russian or Russian Giant sunflower 
and offered these varieties as seeds, which in 1893 
were reintroduced to the United States.  Sunflowers 
are used as a source of vegetable oil.  The seeds are 
used for snacks and for bird food.  
 
Medicinal: Medicinal uses for the sunflower utilized 
by the Europeans include use as a remedy for 
pulmonary affections, a preparation of the seeds has 
been widely used for cold and coughs, in the 
Caucasus the seeds have served as a substitute for 
quinine in the treatment of malaria, and sunflower 
seeds are used as a diuretic and expectorant (Heiser 
1976).  Sunflower pith has been used by the 
Portuguese in making moxa, which was used in the 
cauterization of wounds and infections.  An infusion 
from the flowers has been used to kill flies.  
 
A variety of terpenoid compounds have been found 
in Helianthus species, primarily sesquiterpene 
lactones and diterpenes (Gershenzon and Mabry 
1984).  These substances probably offer sunflowers 
protection against some insects. 
 
Horticultural: Sunflowers are cultivated as 
ornamentals or garden plants, where the blooms are 
cherished for their beauty, and the seeds can be eaten 
by both humans and wildlife.  Game birds, songbirds, 
and rodents (Martin et al. 1951) eat the large, 
nutritious seeds of sunflowers.  These attractive 
weedy plants are of outstanding value to wildlife in 
the prairies and other parts of the West.  Birds eating 
the seeds include Wilson snipes, doves, grouse, ring-
necked pheasants, quail, blackbirds, bobolinks, lazuli 
buntings, black-capped chickadees, cowbirds, white-
winged crossbills, crows, house finches, goldfinches, 
purple grackles, horned larks, longspurs, 
meadowlarks, white-breasted nuthatches, 
pyrrhuloxias, ravens, sparrows, and tufted titmice.  
Small mammals who relish the seeds include the least 
chipmunk, eastern pocket gopher, ground squirrels, 
lemmings, meadow mice, pocket mice, white-footed 
mice, prairie dogs, and kangaroo rats.  Muskrats eat 
the stems and foliage.  Antelope, deer, and moose 
browse on the plants. 
 
Industry: Sunflower stalks have been used as fuel, 
fodder for livestock, food for poultry, and ensilage 
(Heiser 1976).  In the Soviet Union, after the dried 
flower stalks have been used for fuel, the ashes are 
returned to the soil.  The seed hulls could be used for 
“litter” for poultry or returned to the soil or 
composted.  A few years ago, it was found that the 
hulls could be used in fuels.  Today the hulls are used 
in the Soviet Union in manufacturing ethyl alcohol 
and furfural, in lining plywood, and in growing yeast.  
The stems have been used as a source of commercial 
fiber.  The Chinese have used this fiber for the 
manufacturing of fabrics.  Other countries are 
experimenting with the use of fiber in paper.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_='Seed Propagation: When the soil has warmed up to at 
least 45ºF (7ºC) in the spring, sow hardy sunflower 
seeds where they are to flower.  Seeds can also be 
sown in pots or seed trays and either planted out in 
their final positions in late fall or overwintered in a 
cold frame to be planted out in spring.  This 
technique is particularly useful in gardens with clay 
soil that is slow to warm up in spring. 
 
There are two main methods of sowing outdoors in 
situ: broadcast and in drills.  For both, prepare the 
seedbed first.  Dig over the soil to one spade’s depth, 
then rake over and firm.  Broadcast Sowing: Sprinkle 
seeds thinly and evenly on the surface of the prepared 
seedbed and rake them in lightly.  Label seedbeds, 
then water the area gently but thoroughly with a fine 
spray.  Sowing in Drills: Using either a trowel tip or 
the corner of a hoe, mark out shallow drill holes 3-6” 
(8-15 cm) apart, depending on the ultimate size of the 
plant.  Sow seeds thinly and evenly by sprinkling or 
placing them along each drill at the appropriate 
depth.  Carefully cover with soil and firm.  Label 
each row and water gently but thoroughly with a fine 
spray. 
 
To prevent overcrowding, the seedlings usually need 
to be thinned.  To minimize disturbance to a seedling 
being retained, press the soil around it after thinning 
the adjacent seedlings.  Water the newly establishing 
seedlings fairly frequently until the roots have 
developed.  Support is required for the sunflower 
stems.  Stakes help support the stem and protect the 
seedlings from rodent or bird damage.  Birds and 
small mammals love both the sunflower seeds and 
the tender young seedlings.  A scarecrow or netting 
may be necessary to protect the plants from 
herbivores.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='In pre-European settlement times, the Hidatsa 
cultivated sunflowers in the following ways (Wilson 
1917): 
 
 
1) Garden plots were created from wooded and 
brushy areas in river bottomlands. 
2) Brush cleared for planting was spread over the 
plots and burned, for it was conventional wisdom that 
burning trees and brush “softened the soil and left it 
loose and mellow for planting”.  Burning also added 
nutrients to the soil. 
Before setting fire to the fields, the dry grass, leaves, 
and brush were removed from the edges of the fields 
so the fire wouldn’t spread. 
3) Plots were allowed to lay fallow, and were taken 
out of production for two years to let them 
rejuvenate. 
4) Sunflowers were the first seeds planted in the 
spring.  Planting was done using a hoe.  Three seeds 
were planted in a hill, at the depth of the second joint 
of a woman’s finger.  The three seeds were planted 
together, pressed into the loose soil by a single 
motion, with the thumb and first two fingers.  The 
hill was heaped up and patted firm.  Sunflowers were 
planted only around the edges of a field.  The hills 
were placed eight or nine paces apart.  
There were several varieties of sunflowers. black, 
white, red, and striped colors occurred in the seeds. 
5) Seeds were harvested by spreading sunflower 
heads on the roof to dry.  The heads were laid face 
downward, with the backs to the sun.  After the heads 
had dried for four days, the heads were threshed by 
laying them on the floor face downwards and beating 
them as a stick.  An average threshing filled a good-
sized basket, with enough seed left over to make a 
small package. 
6) Parched sunflower seeds were pounded in the corn 
mortar to make meal.  Sunflower meal was used in a 
dish called four-vegetables-mixed. it included beans, 
dried squash, pounded parched sunflower seed, and 
pounded parched corn. 
7) Sunflower seed balls were made of sunflower seed 
meal.  In the olden times, every warrior carried a bag 
of soft skin with a sunflower-seed ball, wrapped in a 
piece of buffalo-heart skin.  When worn with fatigue 
or overcome with sleep and weariness, the warrior 
took out his sunflower-seed ball, and nibbled at it to 
refresh himself. 
Each garden plot was “owned” and tended by a 
woman who cleared it.  It was kept cleared of weeds 
and birds were chased off.

leathery.  The small, white flowers are arranged in 
large terminal clusters and each flower has 5 petals, 5 
sepals, and 10 stamens.  The fruits are bright red or 
yellow drupe-like pomes with dry pulp and contain 3 
to 6 seeds.  They persist through winter.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_='Seeds: Clean off as much of the pulp as possible and 
then put the fresh seeds in water and let them rot for 
one week.  This is a good technique for getting the 
seed separated from the fleshy part of the fruit. If the 
seeds have been stored, they need three months 
stratification before planting.  Plant the seeds directly 
in the ground in the fall and water them.  Plant them 
in full sun in almost any soil type.  If the seedlings 
come up too thick, thin them.  This shrub makes a 
magnificent hedge plant and birds love the fruits.  
Seeds may also be planted in containers for the first 
year and then planted out in the second fall. 
 
Cuttings: Cut 4-5 inch tips of the semi ripe wood in 
early summer and strip off the lower half of the 
leaves and dip each cutting into a rooting hormone.  
Put the cuttings into a rooting medium such as 
perlite-sand in four-inch pots spaced about one-half 
inch apart.  Keep the pots watered and sheltered from 
wind and direct sun.  The cuttings take about two to 
three months to root.  New growth on the tops of the 
plants signifies root development.  After rooting, 
transplant each plant into individual pots, one plant 
per pot.  Plant each plant in a light, loose soil in 
partial shade, and water it, keeping it moist and 
protecting it from hot sun, winds, and animals.  The

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Uses='Ethnobotanic: Many tribes in California gathered the 
fruit for food including the Salinan, Maidu, Karok, 
Sierra Miwok, Pomo, Luiseno, Hupa, Wappo, and 
Yuki.  It is important to wait until the red fruits are 
very ripe before picking and eating them.  They are 
boiled or roasted before consuming or sometimes 
they are eaten raw.  Among the Sierra Miwok, the 
fruits were boiled and baked in a deep narrow earth 
oven.  Another preparation technique was to store the 
fruits in a basket for two months until they had 
softened and then they were parched with coals in a 
basket and eaten.  The fruits were reputed to be 
slightly puckery.  The Yuki made the leaves and bark 
into a decoction for medicinal use in treating 
stomachache and various body aches and pains. 
 
Wildlife: Upland game birds such as band-tailed 
pigeons and songbirds including northern red-
breasted sapsuckers, thrashers, and wren-tits consume 
the fruits.  Small mammals such as the large-eared 
wood rat and the portola wood rat also feed on the 
fruits.

Ethnobotanic: Sweetgrass was and still is used 
ceremonially through burning the dried and braided 
grass stems for an incense or smudge.  The fragrant 
smoke is used for purification and to carry prayers to 
the Great Spirit.  Hierochloë literally translates from 
Greek as sacred (hieros) and grass (chloë) or “holy 
grass” (Hitchcock et al. 1973).  Indian people call 
sweetgrass the “grass that never dies.”  Even when it 
is cut, it retains its fragrance and spirit (Youngbuck 
pers. comm. 1999).  Today, sweetgrass is used inter-
tribally throughout the country.  Sweetgrass was used 
ceremonially by many tribes, including the Omaha, 
Ponca, Kiowa, Dakota, Lakota, Blackfeet, Cheyenne, 
Pawnee, and Winnebago (Jordan 1965, Moerman 
1986).  The Cheyenne, Blackfeet, and Lakota use 
sweetgrass in the Sun Dance (Kindscher 1992, Hart 
1976).  Sweetgrass symbolizes life’s growth for the 
Cheyenne (Ibid.).  
 
Sweetgrass was the most popular perfumery of the 
Blackfeet, who braided it and kept it with their 
clothes like a sachet or carried it in small bags 
(McClintock 1909).  The Cheyenne mixed sweetgrass 
with pineapple weed (Matricaria matricarioides) to 
use as a perfume (Hart 1976).  The Thompson 
Indians used an infusion of the plant as a wash for the 
hair and body (Moerman 1986).  The Blackfeet and 
the Gros Ventre used sweetgrass as a hair rinse to 
achieve a lustrous shine (Hart 1976).  
 
Blackfeet women made a tea from sweetgrass that 
was drunk to stop vaginal bleeding after birth and to 
expel the placenta (Hellson 1974).  Women burned 
sweetgrass braids after their moon time to finish the 
cleansing.  Blackfeet men drank sweetgrass tea to 
treat venereal infections.  Both sexes drank a tea from 
this plant to treat coughs and sore throats.  Windburn 
and chapping were treated through an infusion of 
sweetgrass stems soaked in water or a salve of 
sweetgrass water and grease.  The sweetgrass water 
was also used as an eyewash.  Sweetgrass was mixed 
with seeds of meadow rue (Thalictrum occidentale) 
to make a tea to clear congested nasal passages 
(Kindscher 1992).  The Karok of northern California 
used an infusion of sweetgrass to treat women who 
had suffered a miscarriage (Strike 1994).  Pregnant 
women drank this infusion to arrest fetus growth.  
The Karok also fed sweetgrass to sick dogs. 
 
Among the Chippewa, sweetgrass was used as an 
incense or smudge in ceremony, as a spiritual 
medicine, and in basketweaving (Densmore 1974).

The use of incense is more characteristic of the Plains 
Indians than of the Algonquian tribes (Ibid.).  
According to Densmore, “Men would smudge before 
hunting to purify body and spirit.  Medicine men kept 
sweetgrass in the bag with their medicinal roots and 
herbs.  Strands of sweetgrass were made into coiled 
basketry by means of cotton thread.  This took the 
form of bowls, oval and round, and of flat mats.  
Birch bark was sometimes used as the center of these 
baskets, with the coils of sweetgrass being sewed 
around it.”  
 
Sweetgrass was used in coiled baskets, primarily in 
the northeast.  The Paiute used sweetgrass woven 
with willow bark in the hoods of cradleboards.  The 
Central-Northern Algonkians, Iroquoians, and 
Hurons edged woodsplint basketry and vessel borders 
with sweetgrass (Turnbaugh et al. 1986).  Central-
Northern Algonkian peoples are known for their 
production of flexible weft-twined bags, and some 
created bundle-coiled baskets of sweetgrass.  
Northern New England basketry intermixed wood 
splints with twisted or braided sweetgrass in one 
basket (Pelletier 1982, Turnbaugh et al. 1986).  In the 
northeast, the Ojibwe, Potawatomi, Winnebago, 
Menominee, Mohawk, Penobscot, Passamaquoddy, 
and Abenaki (Turnbaugh et al. 1986) made coiled 
baskets of sweetgrass.  In the Plains cultural area, 
rawhide containers enjoyed much greater popularity 
than did woven or stitched basketry.  The Arapaho 
and Mandan may have also used sweetgrass in their 
coiled baskets (Ibid.).   
 
Wildlife: Rodents and small mammals (such as pika) 
browse on sweetgrass (Martin 1951). 
 
Restoration: Sweetgrass is a useful plant for wetland 
and riparian restoration and mitigation and spring 
protection/renovation.  Sweetgrass has potential for 
conservation use for erosion control on moderately 
sloping, hillside seeps.  Seeps are sometimes erosive 
because the soil stays liquid and the saturated 
conditions inhibit the growth of many plants.  The 
sod-forming and moisture tolerant characteristics of 
sweetgrass will stabilize the seep (Ivan Dozier pers. 
comm. 1999).

In its native habitat, sweetgrass grows primarily in

The following information on the propagation of 
sweetgrass is obtained from the Bridger Plant 
Materials Center (1996 and 1999) and Susan 
Winslow (1999). 
 
Propagation from Cuttings: Sweetgrass can be 
propagated easily from container or bare rootstock, as 
it produces many rhizomes.  It can also be propagated 
from seed.  However, in nature, sweetgrass is a 
sporadic seed producer, and germination rates are 
fairly low (25-30%), so propagation from seed is

more difficult than from cuttings or division of 
plants.  
 
Handling and care requires commitment and attention 
to detail to maximize survival.  Initially, the plants 
should remain in the pots for an additional 2-3 weeks 
after you receive them, and watering must occur 
every day while in the pots.  This is because of the 
possibility of lingering transplant shock and because 
the soil in the pots dries out fairly quickly.  The 
plants will continue to grow and thrive in the original 
containers for quite a period of time while site 
location and preparation efforts are finalized. 
 
Pick the sites where sweetgrass is to be transplanted 
carefully, and prepare the site properly before 
planting.  It is advisable to keep the immediate 
planting area clear of competing vegetation, which 
may simply mean hand weeding around individual 
plants, or a mechanical means may be required.  
Sweetgrass grows in wetter areas in its natural 
habitat, and during the establishment period irrigation 
is likely to be required.  Soil should be kept very wet 
to moist. 
 
For plants grown in greenhouse flats or collected 
from the wild, it is best to dig up and separate plants 
in late fall or winter (Hartman et al. 1990).  This is 
the “quiescent” period that follows seed maturation, 
and leaves are senescent (dried up and brown 
colored).  When separating plants, ensure that each 
“plantlet” has a rhizome or rhizome bud.  Each plant 
should be planted in full sun in a light, loose soil.  
Plants should be planted on 3-foot centers. they will 
fill in and make solid stands of sweetgrass in one to 
two years.  Plants need to be kept moist, and need 
frequent watering.  Plants may need to be protected 
from herbivores, such as rabbits or gophers.  Dogs 
love sweetgrass and will selectively eat the shoots 
and roll in the grass.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='After the plants have established and grown to a 
minimum height of 4 to 6 inches (to avoid damaging 
small seedlings), routinely weed and remove 
unwanted vegetation.  This will reduce competition 
for light, nutrients, and water, and encourage 
vigorous plant growth and development.  Sweetgrass 
prefers a moist environment, so regularly water the 
site.  The rhizomes (underground, horizontal stems) 
develop early and will emerge during the first 
growing season.  The grass will continue to spread if 
left unattended.  The leaves will reach a length of 
approximately 12-15 inches and can be harvested 
once or twice a year.  The foliage is very relaxed and 
it will be necessary to carefully lift the leaves and cut 
 
 
the stems close to the ground (leave 1 to 2 inches of 
plant stem).  The actual number of harvests per year 
will depend on climatic conditions, seasonal timing, 
and the traditional environmental knowledge of the 
particular indigenous group tending the grass.  Plan 
the final harvest (late summer in northern climes) so 
that there will be adequate time for the plants to 
prepare for the onset of cold temperatures and winter 
conditions.  If this natural hardening-off process does 
not occur, it will eventually have a detrimental effect 
on the long-term persistent and survival of the stand.  
Fertilizing is not recommended in the first year of

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_SeedPropagation='Site Preparation: The site should be prepared well in 
advance of planting, either late in the fall or very 
early in the spring.  Preparation includes the 
following: removal of all weeds. rototilling or hand-
digging so that the soil is loose and friable. raking or 
smoothing to a level, clump-free grade. packing or 
rolling to firm the surface (afterwards, only light foot 
imprints should be visible when walked across). and 
moistening the soil evenly to a depth of 2 to 3 inches 
(or when surface puddling is evident) with a sprinkler 
or hand-held spray nozzle.   
 
Seeding:  Sweetgrass is a cool-season species that 
requires a period of cold temperatures before it will 



Page 4
germinate from seed.  Late fall, late winter, or early 
spring is the best time to plant the sweetgrass seed.  
At the time of seeding, the soil should be moistened 
to a depth of 1 inch.  The seed should be fully ripened 
(very firm when squeezed between fingernails or 
when clipped with a fingernail clipper) and free of 
debris.  Sweetgrass seed is very small at 
approximately 1.1 million seeds per pound.  
Depending on the amount of seed available and the 
plant density desired, the seed can be dribbled in 
rows at a rate of up to 25 seeds per linear foot, or 
broadcast at 50 seeds per square foot.  This may 
optimally result in 6 plants per row and/or 13 plants 
per square foot (seed germination tests have averaged 
25-30%).  Planting depth should not exceed 0.25 to 
0.5 inches.  It is very important after seed placement 
that the area be re-rolled or packed to ensure 
satisfactory seed-to-soil contact.  The tiny seed can 
be easily washed away, so follow planting 
immediately with a light watering.  Keep the area 
moist until seedling emergence, in about 10-14 days.  
In soils (clayey) that are prone to crusting, 
subsequent periodic, short-duration watering may be 
necessary.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Uses='Caution: Coumarin, a natural anticoagulant, gives 
sweetgrass its characteristic sweet smell (Lewis 
1977).  It has potentially toxic properties and can 
cause liver injury and hemorrhages.  Research has 
shown coumarin and related compounds to be 
effective in reducing high-protein edemas, especially 
lymphodema (Leung 1980). 
Ethnobotanic: Sweetgrass was and still is used 
ceremonially through burning the dried and braided 
grass stems for an incense or smudge.  The fragrant 
smoke is used for purification and to carry prayers to 
the Great Spirit.  Hierochloë literally translates from 
Greek as sacred (hieros) and grass (chloë) or “holy 
grass” (Hitchcock et al. 1973).  Indian people call 
sweetgrass the “grass that never dies.”  Even when it 
is cut, it retains its fragrance and spirit (Youngbuck 
pers. comm. 1999).  Today, sweetgrass is used inter-
tribally throughout the country.  Sweetgrass was used 
ceremonially by many tribes, including the Omaha, 
Ponca, Kiowa, Dakota, Lakota, Blackfeet, Cheyenne, 
Pawnee, and Winnebago (Jordan 1965, Moerman 
1986).  The Cheyenne, Blackfeet, and Lakota use 
sweetgrass in the Sun Dance (Kindscher 1992, Hart 
1976).  Sweetgrass symbolizes life’s growth for the 
Cheyenne (Ibid.). 
Sweetgrass was the most popular perfumery of the 
Blackfeet, who braided it and kept it with their 
clothes like a sachet or carried it in small bags 
(McClintock 1909).  The Cheyenne mixed sweetgrass 
with pineapple weed (Matricaria matricarioides) to 
use as a perfume (Hart 1976).  The Thompson 
Indians used an infusion of the plant as a wash for the 
hair and body (Moerman 1986).  The Blackfeet and 
the Gros Ventre used sweetgrass as a hair rinse to 
achieve a lustrous shine (Hart 1976).  
Blackfeet women made a tea from sweetgrass that 
was drunk to stop vaginal bleeding after birth and to 
expel the placenta (Hellson 1974).  Women burned 
sweetgrass braids after their moon time to finish the 
cleansing.  Blackfeet men drank sweetgrass tea to 
treat venereal infections.  Both sexes drank a tea from 
this plant to treat coughs and sore throats.  Windburn 
and chapping were treated through an infusion of 
sweetgrass stems soaked in water or a salve of 
sweetgrass water and grease.  The sweetgrass water 
was also used as an eyewash.  Sweetgrass was mixed 
with seeds of meadow rue (Thalictrum occidentale) 
to make a tea to clear congested nasal passages 
(Kindscher 1992).  The Karok of northern California 
used an infusion of sweetgrass to treat women who 
had suffered a miscarriage (Strike 1994).  Pregnant 
women drank this infusion to arrest fetus growth.  
The Karok also fed sweetgrass to sick dogs. 
Among the Chippewa, sweetgrass was used as an 
incense or smudge in ceremony, as a spiritual 
medicine, and in basketweaving (Densmore 1974). 
The use of incense is more characteristic of the Plains 
Indians than of the Algonquian tribes (Ibid.).  
According to Densmore, “Men would smudge before 
hunting to purify body and spirit.  Medicine men kept 
sweetgrass in the bag with their medicinal roots and 
herbs.  Strands of sweetgrass were made into coiled

basketry by means of cotton thread.  This took the 
form of bowls, oval and round, and of flat mats.  
Birch bark was sometimes used as the center of these 
baskets, with the coils of sweetgrass being sewed 
around it.”  
Sweetgrass was used in coiled baskets, primarily in 
the northeast.  The Paiute used sweetgrass woven 
with willow bark in the hoods of cradleboards.  The 
Central-Northern Algonkians, Iroquoians, and 
Hurons edged woodsplint basketry and vessel borders 
with sweetgrass (Turnbaugh et al. 1986).  Central-
Northern Algonkian peoples are known for their 
production of flexible weft-twined bags, and some 
created bundle-coiled baskets of sweetgrass. 
Northern New England basketry intermixed wood 
splints with twisted or braided sweetgrass in one 
basket (Pelletier 1982, Turnbaugh et al. 1986).  In the 
northeast, the Ojibwe, Potawatomi, Winnebago, 
Menominee, Mohawk, Penobscot, Passamaquoddy, 
and Abenaki (Turnbaugh et al. 1986) made coiled 
baskets of sweetgrass.  In the Plains cultural area, 
rawhide containers enjoyed much greater popularity 
than did woven or stitched basketry.  The Arapaho 
and Mandan may have also used sweetgrass in their 
coiled baskets (Ibid.).   
Wildlife: Rodents and small mammals (such as pika) 
browse on sweetgrass (Martin 1951). 
Restoration: Sweetgrass is a useful plant for wetland 
and riparian restoration and mitigation and spring 
protection/renovation.  Sweetgrass has potential for 
conservation use for erosion control on moderately 
sloping, hillside seeps.  Seeps are sometimes erosive 
because the soil stays liquid and the saturated 
conditions inhibit the growth of many plants.  The 
sod-forming and moisture tolerant characteristics of 
sweetgrass will stabilize the seep (Ivan Dozier pers. 
comm. 1999).

Youngbuck, who is Cherokee, Chiracahua, and Fox: 
1) take only what you need, leaving the best to 
reproduce. 2) speak to the plant, leave an offering of 
tobacco or sage before harvesting. the plant will grow 
back two stems for every one cut. 3) we humans are 
another strand in life. plants sustain us and should be 
treated as another living being. 4) plants were taken 
care of by extended family groups of women. they 
were taken care of and watched each year for 
generations. and 5) materials harvested were shared 
and traded with the whole tribe.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_SeedPropagation='Site Preparation: The site should be prepared well in 
advance of planting, either late in the fall or very 
early in the spring.  Preparation includes the 
following: removal of all weeds. rototilling or hand-
digging so that the soil is loose and friable. raking or 
smoothing to a level, clump-free grade. packing or 
rolling to firm the surface (afterwards, only light foot 
imprints should be visible when walked across). and 
moistening the soil evenly to a depth of 2 to 3 inches 
(or when surface puddling is evident) with a sprinkler 
or hand-held spray nozzle.   
Seeding:  Sweetgrass is a cool-season species that 
requires a period of cold temperatures before it will 
germinate from seed.  Late fall, late winter, or early 
spring is the best time to plant the sweetgrass seed.  
At the time of seeding, the soil should be moistened 
to a depth of 1 inch.  The seed should be fully ripened 
(very firm when squeezed between fingernails or 
when clipped with a fingernail clipper) and free of

debris.  Sweetgrass seed is very small at 
approximately 1.1 million seeds per pound. 
Depending on the amount of seed available and the 
plant density desired, the seed can be dribbled in 
rows at a rate of up to 25 seeds per linear foot, or 
broadcast at 50 seeds per square foot.  This may 
optimally result in 6 plants per row and/or 13 plants 
per square foot (seed germination tests have averaged 
25-30%).  Planting depth should not exceed 0.25 to 
0.5 inches.  It is very important after seed placement 
that the area be re-rolled or packed to ensure 
satisfactory seed-to-soil contact.  The tiny seed can 
be easily washed away, so follow planting 
immediately with a light watering.  Keep the area 
moist until seedling emergence, in about 10-14 days. 
In soils (clayey) that are prone to crusting, 
subsequent periodic, short-duration watering may be 
necessary.

Andrew’s cross is a native, perennial shrub or sub-
shrub.  The common name refers to the petals, which 
make an oblique cross similar to the cross of Saint 
Andrew the Apostle, patron saint of Scotland, Russia, 
and Greece.  The shrub has a single to several erect 
stems with several axillary branches at the top (3 to 
15 dm tall).  Older stems are reddish-brown, with 
sloughing or shredding bark.  The linear leaf blades 
are variable, ranging in shape from narrow to 
elliptical (5 to 25 mm long, 1.5 to 6 mm wide).  The 
solitary flowers are at the terminal ends of the 
branches, just above the last pair of leaves.  The two 
large and two small sepals are arranged in unequal 
pairs.  The four flower petals are pale yellow (8 to 10 
mm long) with numerous stamens.  The oval to 
elliptical seed capsules (4 to 9 mm long) enclose 
black, oblong seeds (1mm long).  The plants may 
flower from spring through fall, or all year depending 
on the climate.   
 
Distribution: For current distribution, please consult

tribes in the Southeastern United States including the 
Alabama, Cherokee, Creek, Natchez, and Seminole 
used Yaupon for medicinal as well as other purposes.  
A decoction was made from the leaves and shoots, 
called “black drink”, which was used medicinally, 
ceremonially, and was also served as a social drink.  
The leaves and shoots, which contain caffeine, were 
roasted in an earthenware container over a fire, much 
like coffee beans are roasted.  The black drink was 
drunk socially and offered to visitors to indicate 
friendly intensions.  Its primary medicinal use was as 
an emetic, to induce vomiting and as a purgative or 
laxative.  It was taken to cure “a tremor in the 
nerves.”  The drink was used in ceremonial medicine 
as an emetic to “clear out the system and produce 
ceremonial purity.”  In some tribes, women and boys 
were prohibited from imbibing the drink.  The 
Florida Seminoles still brew a “black drink” for their 
annual Green Corn Dance, although it is not always 
made with Yaupon, but from other plants.  The plant 
                          Plant Guide  
 
was also used as a hallucinogen to “evoke ecstasies.”  
The bark was used to treat nightmares where the 
patient sees ghosts and talks during sleep.  Sore eyes 
were treated with eyewash made by scraping off the 
inner bark and boiling it in water for several hours.  
The wood was used to make arrows and ramrods that 
were used in hunting and fishing.  In addition to 
trading Yaupon with nearby neighbors, Native 
American tribes in the Southeastern United States 
probably increased the distribution of yaupon.  There 
is evidence that they transplanted and cared for the 
trees (see Hammett 1992 for references).   
 
Wildlife: The showy red berries of yaupon attract 
wildlife and are an important food for many 
songbirds, gamebirds and waterfowl.  Bluebirds, 
catbirds, mockingbirds, robins, yellow-shafted 
flickers, red-naped sapsuckers, yellow-bellied 
sapsuckers, white-throated sparrows and cedar 
waxwings are among the many songbirds that feed on 
the berries.  Florida ducks, black ducks, mourning 
doves, ruffed grouse, bobwhite quail and wild turkeys 
also consume the berries.  Armadillos, black bears, 
gray foxes, western foxes, raccoons and skunks eat 
the fruits.  White-tailed deer browse the foliage and 
twigs.  The evergreen nature of the yaupon is 
important to wildlife as it provides cover during the 
winter months.

spread a delicate network of the same material to 
draw in the loop.  One Indian stated that &quot.it takes 
nearly six weeks to make a rope twelve feet long.&quot.  In 
spite of the tremendous labor of preparing this 
material, the iris fiber was one of the most generally 
employed in northwestern California.  The threads 
and cords of this fiber were used to make fishing 
nets, camping bags and snares for catching deer, 
birds, and other game. 
 
Since iris is fine and can be bent at sharp angles, it 
makes an excellent starting knot in coiled baskets.  It 
is said that babies were wrapped in the soft green 
leaves of Iris douglasiana while their mothers 
collected manzanita berries, to keep the babies cool 
and to prevent dehydration.  
 
The Monache and the Southern Yokuts in California 
make flour from iris seed.  The Pomo placed acorn 
meal in a shallow pit and covered the meal with Iris 
leaves before pouring water over the meal to leach 
out tannic acid.  
 
A poultice of the raw rhizome is especially effective 
against staph sores.  Externally, iris is successfully 
used in infected wounds, ulcers, and fistulas, plus to 
take away freckles.  Only the dry root should be used 
internally.  Iris is active as a cathartic, has a 
stimulating effect on the production of both 
pancreatic enzymes and bile, is a strong diuretic, and 
will stimulate both saliva and sweat.  This is a useful 
medicinal plant, but in general should be used with 
care and preferably in combinations where less 
energetic plants form the bulk of a medicinal 
formula.  
 
Tea from iris roots was used for kidney trouble by 
several California Indian peoples (Murphey 1959).  
The Yana chewed iris roots to cure coughs.  The 
Modoc used an iris root decoction to soothe sore 
eyes. A piece of iris root was inserted in a tooth 
cavity to kill the nerve, so the tooth will come out.  
Tests showed slight bactericidal effects, slight effects 
on rabbit pneumonia, and an ascorbic acid content of 
4% (Archer 1957).  Roots were burned and the 
smoke inhaled to alleviate dizziness.  A root 
decoction was used as a cathartic and emetic, but 
large doses could cause severe digestive problems. 
 
Landscaping &amp. Wildlife: The beautiful and variable 
blossoms lend themselves to landscaping, where they 
naturalize and require minimal maintenance.

Ethnobotanical: Iris makes some of the finest 
cordage. the fibers are particularly strong and 
flexible.  Only two fibers can be taken from each iris 
leaf margin.  Huge bunches of leaves were harvested 
in the fall and stored until needed.  Iris cordage was 
used for fishing nets, string, rope, snares, hairnets, 
and regalia. The fibers are fine like silk, but 
surprisingly strong.  
 
Rope was made from fibers, which occur, on the 
outside of iris leaves.  The iris leaves were gathered 
in large bundles and a single silky fiber was taken 
from each margin of the leaf. None of the other fibers 
was used.  Using a mussel-shell or abalone 
&quot.thumbnail&quot. the women stripped the fibers from the 
leaves.  The fibers are detached from the leaves and 
scraped clean of all tissues.  The men, mostly while 
sitting around in their sweathouses twisted the 
threads on the bare thigh. The men always knotted 
the fishing nets.  A deer rope is near 20 feet long with 
lasso at one end, and about half an inch in diameter.  
This loop was set over a deer trail to catch the head 
or antlers.  Within the set loop over the trail was

Horticulturally, it is used for rock gardens, ground 
cover, borders, wetlands, ponds, and streams.  Native 
irises are free flowering, most are long lived, require 
very little attention, and provide an abundance of 
seeds.  Iris flowers attract insects and birds.  Irises 
provide nectar to hummingbirds.  The mountain 
beaver (Aplodontia rufa ) is also known to feed on 
the leaves and stems of iris that occur in the vicinity 
of its tunnels.  
 
Invasive Potential: Irises are sometimes invasive.  
Irises can become noxious weeds in pastures, because 
the leaves are unpalatable and bitter.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Description TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Description='General: Iris Family (Iridaceae).  The native irises 
are perennial herbs, usually evergreen and growing 
from a creeping, tuberous rhizome.  Irises can be 
identified by their double row of leaves, which 
overlap like praying hands.  The leaves are long and 
linear with parallel venation. Flower stems are erect 
and simple.  Blossoms vary somewhat in spacing of 
the parts, width of sepals, and the inner, erect 
standards (petals).  Iris douglasiana has pale cream to 
light, dark lavender or deep reddish purple flowers 
that bloom from May to June. 
 
' WHERE symbol='irdo';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Distribution TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Distribution='For current distribution, please consult the Plant 
Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
site.  Iris douglasiana grows abundantly along the 
coast from north Santa Barbara County, California, 
into Oregon.  It is found in shade with moist soils 
with ample organic matter. This plant is common in 
grassy places, especially near the coast, at elevations 
generally less than 100 m.  It grows naturally in the 
coastal prairie and mixed evergreen forest 
communities. 
 
' WHERE symbol='irdo';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='The native irises are excellent in shade situations, 
even dense shade of walls and fences (Schmidt 
1980).  They will tolerate sun for most of the day in 
mild areas, and should have afternoon shade and 
ample water in the interior regions.  Plants may be 
watered the year round.  Fertilization increases 
biomass and seed production. This iris has a 
clumping rhizome system, and is readily propagated 
by plant division in fall or winter. 
 
 
 
When allowed to increase freely, plants will 
naturalize and eventually form extensive ground 
cover.  Unless the seed vessels are removed there will 
be many volunteer plants, but if inferior flower size 
or color appears it should be culled immediately.  
Irises start growing with the first cool weather and 
rains in fall, reaching the height of their growth in 
spring and early summer.  They go dormant after 
seed set, in hot dry summer.  
 
Propagation by Plant Division: Iris douglasiana is 
clonal, radiating outward in growth from the center.  
The best propagation method for these is division, in 
fall or winter after the first new roots are established 
but before the flowers form.  
 
Native irises in the wild tend to produce only a small, 
dry rhizome with stringy roots, which is difficult to 
dig.  Vigorous garden or greenhouse plants produce 
firm, white, growing roots especially in winter and 
spring growing seasons, and clumps are easily 
divided at those time.  Remove a new fan with fleshy 
roots set in a prepared site, water it, and provide 
shade for a few days if the plant is placed in full sun.  
Frequent division appears to keep the plants 
vigorous, as well as being the best method of 
increasing the supply of superior forms. 
 
Propagation by Seed: Iris seed is easily collected 
from the large capsules.  The capsules turn from 
green to brown and open at the top when they are 
ripe.  They have to be watched closely, because they 
disperse rapidly.  Two days after ripening, the seed is 
gone.  Collect capsules carefully to avoid spilling 
seeds.  Each capsule has from 20 to 80 seeds. 
 
Seeds should be stored in paper envelopes at room 
temperature until they are planted. The seeds of all 
species will keep up to 10 years at room temperature. 
 
Plant seeds in 6-inch pots, using a combination of 
leaf mold and peat moss.  Cover seeds with 1/2 inch 
of same material.  Any good potting soil that s acidic 
is good for seed germination. 
 
After planting, over-winter the pots outdoors in 
November or December.  They will come up in 2-3 
months, depending on the weather.  Germination 
increases the second year, because there s always a 
percentage of hard seeds that won t germinate the 
first year.  Part of the seed waits for the next year, to 
increase the probability for good weather conditions 
and optimize germination success. 
 
Plant the seedlings in May, when the young plants 
are usually 3 to 6 inches tall or even taller.  Plant 

Page 3
from 6 inches to one-foot spacing.  If a natural look is 
desired, scatter and clump the plantings.  Water 
plants through the dry season until the roots have 
established. After the first year the plants should be 
self-maintaining without additional watering, unless 
there is an unusually hot, dry spell.  Plants will begin 
to bloom by their second  year if growth has been 
continuous. 
 
Direct seeding is possible in places that can be left 
undisturbed, as among shrubs, or among low 
perennials where the seedlings can be sheltered.  If 
planting seeds in the ground, autumn is the best time 
for seeding. germination begins in two or three 
months and often continues beyond that time.  A 
friable seed mixture of sand, loam, and either peat or 
screened leaf mold is best, covering the seed with 
sphagnum moss to aid in preventing damping-off of 
seedlings. 
 
' WHERE symbol='irdo';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='In autumn old leaves should be removed from the 
center of large clumps, the foliage cut back, and a 
mulch applied, especially if the irises are being 
naturalized in a semi-dry area. Traditional resource 
management included harvesting huge bunches of iris 
leaves in the fall, and storing these leaves until 
needed.  The fibers are then harvested from the 
leaves. This naturally accomplished the pruning and 
mulching that modern horticulturists practice to 
maintain iris beds. 
 
The PCI Borer (Amphipoea americana var. pacifica ) 
and Iris Borer are serious pests of iris.  The Iris Borer 
stays in the rhizome through the winter, then 
metamorphoses, coming out in the spring as a 
nocturnal moth. Controlling the moth when its flying, 
to prevent it from laying its eggs on the iris, would 
control the borer.  The UC Botanical Garden used the 
biological control Bacillus thuringienis, but it didn t 
help.  At this time, it is recommended to dig the 
infected plant out entirely, put it a plastic bag, and 
put them in the garbage can to avoid contamination 
of other plants. 
 
Milkweed (Asclepias species) and dogbane 
(Apocynum cannibinum ) were traditionally burned 
by native people in the fall to maintain vigorous plant 
production, to stimulate plant growth, to optimize 
long and abundant fiber production from leaves and 
stalks, and to stimulate seed production.  It is 
probable that iris was burned for the same reasons.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Adaptation: It is able to tolerate sun to high shade, 
and requires moderate moisture.  In the wild, 
Fernald’s iris grows in shady places from 50 to 2000 
m in elevation.  This iris is native to shady sloped in 
the mixed evergreen forest.  Horticulturally, it is used 
for borders, among trees and shrubs.  This iris is not a 
clumping form. it will reseed densely in good 
conditions.  Iris fernaldii hybridizes with Iris 
macrosiphon and the hybrid populations threaten the 
pure strains. 
 
The native irises are excellent in shade situations, 
even dense shade of walls and fences (Schmidt 
1980).  They will tolerate sun for most of the day in 
mild areas, and should have afternoon shade and 
ample water in the interior regions.  These plants are 
intolerant of frequent summer water. they should not 
be planted near lawns or other moisture-loving 
plants.  These plants require excellent drainage.  
Compacted or other water-holding soils may need to 
be modified.  Fertilization increases biomass and 
seed production. 
 
When allowed to increase freely, plants will 
naturalize and eventually form extensive ground 
cover.  Unless the seed vessels are removed there will 
be many volunteer plants, but if inferior flower size 
or color appears it should be culled immediately. 
 
Irises start growing with the first cool weather and 
rains in fall, reaching the height of their growth in 
spring and early summer. 
 
Propagation by Plant Division: Iris species are 
clonal, radiating in their growth outward from the 
center.  The best propagation method for these is 
division, in fall or winter after the first new roots are 
established but before the flowers form.  
 
Native irises in the wild tend to produce only a small, 
dry rhizome with stringy roots which is difficult to 
dig.  Vigorous garden or greenhouse plants produce 
firm, white, growing roots especially in winter and 
spring growing seasons, and clumps are easily 
divided at those time.  Remove a new fan with fleshy 
roots set in a prepared site, water it, and provide 
shade for a few days if the plant is placed in full sun.  
Frequent division appears to keep the plants 
vigorous, as well as being the best method of 
increasing the supply of superior forms. 
 
Propagation by Seed: Iris seed is easily collected 
from the large capsules.  The capsules turn from 
green to brown and open at the top when they are 
ripe.  You have to watch them closely, they split very 
rapidly, then two days later the seed is spilled out.  
Collect capsules carefully to avoid spilling seeds.  
Each capsule contains from 20 to 80 seeds. 
 
Seeds should be stored in paper envelopes at room 
temperature until they are planted. The seeds of all 
species will keep up to 10 years at room temperature. 
 
Plant seeds in 6-inch pots, using a combination of 
leaf mold and peat moss.  Cover seeds with 1/2 inch 
of same material.  Any good potting soil that s acidic 
is good for seed germination. 
 
After planting, over-winter the pots outdoors in 
November or December.  They will come up in 2-3 
months, depending on the weather.  Germination 
increases the second year, because there s always a 
percentage of a hard seed that won t germinate the 
first year.  Part of the seed waits for the next year, to 
increase the probability for good weather conditions 
and optimize germination success. 
 
Plant the seedlings in May, when the young plants 
are usually 3 to 6 inches tall or even taller.  Plants are 
likely to require watering the first year while roots 
are being established.  Plant from 6 inches to one-
foot when spacing.  If a natural look is desired, 
scatter and clump the plantings.  Plants will begin to 
bloom by their second year if growth has been 
continuous.  
 
Direct seeding is possible in places that can be left 
undisturbed, as among shrubs, or among low 
perennials where the seedlings can be sheltered.  If 
planting seeds in the ground, autumn is the best time 
for seeding. germination begins in two or three 
months and often continues beyond that time.  A 
friable seed mixture of sand, loam, and either peat or 
screened leaf mold is best, covering the seed with

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='In autumn old leaves should be removed from the 
center of large clumps, the foliage cut back, and a 
mulch applied, especially if the irises are being 
naturalized in a semi-dry area.  Traditional resource 
management included harvesting huge bunches of iris 
leaves in the fall, and storing these leaves until 
needed.  The fibers are then harvested from the 
leaves.  This naturally accomplished the pruning and 
mulching that modern horticulturists practice to 
maintain iris beds. 
 
The PCI borer (Amphipoea americana var. pacifica ) 
and iris borer are serious pests of iris.  The iris borer 
stays in the rhizome through the winter then 
metamorphose, coming out sometime in the spring as 
a nocturnal moth.  Controlling the moth when its 
flying, to prevent it from laying its eggs on the Iris, 
would control the borer.  At this time, it is 
recommended to dig the infected plant out entirely, 
put it a plastic bag, and put them in the garbage can 
to avoid contamination of other plants. 
 
Milkweed (Asclepias species) and dogbane 
(Apocynum cannibinum) were traditionally burned by 
native people in the fall to maintain vigorous plant 
production, to stimulate plant growth, to optimize 
long and abundant fiber production from leaves and 
stalks, and to stimulate seed production.  It is 
probable that iris was burned for the same reasons.

birds, and other game.  Since iris is fine and can be 
bent at sharp angles, it makes an excellent starting 
knot in coiled baskets. 
 
The Pomo placed acorn meal in a shallow pit and 
covered the meal with iris leaves before pouring 
water over the meal to leach out tannic acid.  The 
Monache and the Southern Yokuts in California 
make flour from iris seed.   
 
A poultice of the raw rhizome is especially effective 
against staph sores.  Externally iris is successfully 
used in infected wounds, ulcers, fistulas and to take 
away freckles.  Only the dry root should be used 
internally.  Iris is active as an cathartic, has a 
stimulating effect on the production of both 
pancreatic enzymes and bile, is a strong diuretic, and 
will stimulate both saliva and sweat.  This is a useful 
drug plant but in general should be used with care 
and preferably in combinations where less energetic 
plants form the bulk of a medicinal formula.  
 
Tea from iris roots was used for kidney trouble by 
several California Indian peoples (Murphy 1959).  
The Yana chewed iris roots to cure coughs.  The 
Modoc used an iris root decoction to soothe sore 
eyes.  A piece of iris root was inserted in a tooth 
cavity to kill the nerve, so the tooth will come out.  
Roots were burned and the smoke inhaled to alleviate 
dizziness.  A root decoction was used as a cathartic 
and emetic, but large doses could cause severe 
digestive problems. 
 
Landscaping &amp. Wildlife: The beautiful and variable 
blossoms lend themselves to landscaping, where they 
naturalize and require minimal maintenance.  Native 
irises are free flowering, most are long lived, require 
very little attention, and provide an abundance of 
seeds.  Iris flowers attract insects and birds.  Irises 
provide both nectar and insects to hummingbirds.

Ethnobotanic: Iris makes some of the finest cordage 
with fibers that are particularly strong and flexible. 
The fibers are fine like silk.  Only two fibers can be 
taken from each iris leaf margin with the remainder 
discarded.  Significant numbers of leaves were 
harvested in the fall and stored until needed.  Iris 
cordage was used for fishing nets, string, rope, 
snares, hairnets, and regalia. 
 
The men knotted the fishing nets from this material.  
Iris rope was used to catch animals.  A deer rope is 
near 20 feet long with a lasso at one end, and about 
half an inch in diameter.  This loop was set over a 
deer trail to catch the head or antlers.  Within the set 
loop over the trail was spread a delicate network of 
the same material to draw in the loop.  One Indian 
stated that &quot.it takes nearly six weeks to make a rope 
twelve feet long.&quot. 
 
In spite of the tremendous labor of preparing this 
material, the iris fiber was one of the most generally 
employed in northwestern California.  The threads 
and cords of this fiber were used to make fishing 
nets, camping bags and snares for catching deer,

nets, camping bags and snares for catching deer, 
birds, and other game.  In spite of the tremendous 
labor of preparing this material, the iris fiber was one 
of the most generally employed in northwestern 
California. 
 
Rope was made from fibers, which occur, on the 
outer margins of iris leaves. Huge bunches of leaves 
were harvested in the fall and stored until needed.  A 
single silky fiber was taken from each margin of the 
leaf.  None of the other fibers were used.  The men 
always knotted the fishing nets.  A deer rope is near 
20 feet long with a lasso at one end, and about half an 
inch in diameter.  This loop was set over a deer trail 
to catch the head or antlers.  Within the set loop over 
the trail was spread a delicate network of the same 
material to draw in the loop.  One Indian stated that 
&quot.it takes nearly six weeks to make a rope twelve feet 
long.&quot.  
 
A poultice of the raw rhizome is especially effective 
against staph sores.  Externally iris rhizomes are 
successfully used on infected wounds, ulcers, fistulas 
and to take away freckles.  Only the dried iris root or 
rhizome should be used internally.  Iris is active as a 
cathartic, has a stimulating effect on the production 
of both pancreatic enzymes and bile, is a strong 
diuretic, and will stimulate both saliva and sweat.  
This is a useful medicinal plant but in general should 
be used with care and preferably in combinations 
where less energetic plants forming the bulk of a 
medicinal formula.   
 
Landscaping &amp. Wildlife: The beautiful and variable 
blossoms lend themselves to landscaping, where they 
naturalize and require minimal maintenance.  Native 
irises are free flowering, most are long lived, require 
very little attention, and provide an abundance of 
seeds.  Iris flowers attract both insects and 
hummingbirds.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Description='General: Iris Family (Iridaceae).  Western blue flag is 
a perennial herb, usually evergreen and growing from 
a creeping, tuberous rhizome.  Rhizomes on blue flag 
are between 20-30 mm in diameter, quite large for a 
native iris.  The leaves are long and linear with 
parallel venation, 3-9 mm wide, and sometimes 
purplish.  Stems are 2-5 dm and sometimes branched.  
Blossoms of Iris missouriensis are pale lilac to 
whitish with lilac-purple veins.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='The native irises are excellent in shade situations, 
even dense shade of walls and fences (Schmidt 
1980).  They will tolerate sun for most of the day in 
mild areas, and should have afternoon shade and 
ample water in the interior regions.  These plants are 
intolerant of frequent summer water. they should not 
be planted near lawns or other moisture-loving 
plants.  However, Iris missouriensis does need 
irrigation to get established.  Fertilization increases 
biomass and seed production.  Irises start growing 
with the first cool weather and fall rains, reaching the 
height of their growth in spring and early summer.  
This iris is rhizomatous, forms clumps, and 
propagates readily from plant division in fall or 
winter. 
 
Propagation by Plant Division: In the wild, Iris 
missouriensis tends to produce only a small, dry 
rhizome with stringy roots.  Vigorous garden or 
greenhouse plants produce firm, white, growing roots 
especially during the winter and spring growing 
seasons, allowing easy division of clumps.  Remove a 
new rhizome fan with fleshy roots and set it in a 
prepared site.  Keep the newly planted rhizome 
watered so that it is moist, and provide shade for a 
few days if the plant is placed in full sun.  Frequent 
division appears to keep the plants vigorous, as well 
as being the best method of increasing the supply. 
 
Propagation by Seed: Iris seeds are easily collected 
from the large capsules.  These capsules turn from 
green to brown and open at the top when ripe.  Care 
must be taken when handling seeds because they split 
very rapidly. two days after ripening the seed has 
spilled out.  Collect capsules carefully to avoid 
spilling seeds. each capsule has from 20 to 80 seeds.  
Seeds should be stored in paper envelopes at room 
temperature until they are planted.  The seeds of all 
species will keep up to 10 years at room temperature. 
 
 
 
Plant seeds in 6-inch pots, using a combination of 
leaf mold and peat moss.  Cover seeds with 1/2 inch 
of same material.  Any good potting soil that s acidic 
is good for seed germination.  Keep soil moist but not 
wet.  After planting, over-winter the pots outdoors in 
November or December.  They will come up in 2-3 
months, depending on the weather.  Germination 
increases the second year, because there s always a 
percentage of hard seeds that won t germinate the 
first year.  Delaying germination until the next year, 
to increase the probability for good weather 
conditions and optimize germination success 
enhances seedling survival. 
 
Plant the seedlings outdoors in May, when the young 
plants are usually 3 to 6 inches tall or even taller.  
Plants are likely to require watering the first year 
during roots establishment.  Plant from 6 inches to 
one-foot spacing.  If a natural look is desired, scatter 
and clump the plantings.  Plants will begin to bloom 
by their second year if growth has been continuous.  
 
Direct seeding is possible in places that can be left 
undisturbed, as among shrubs, or among low 
perennials where the seedlings can be sheltered.  If 
planting seeds in the ground, autumn is the best time 
for seeding. germination begins in two or three 
months and often continues beyond that time.  A 
friable seed mixture of sand, loam, and either peat or 
screened leaf mold is best, covering the seed with 
sphagnum moss to aid in preventing damping-off of 
seedlings.

The PCI borer (Amphipoea americana var. pacifica ) 
and iris borer (in the eastern U.S.) are serious pests of 
iris.  The PCI borer stays in the rhizome through the 
winter, then metamorphoses, coming out sometime in 
the spring as a nocturnal moth.  Controlling the moth, 
to prevent it from laying its eggs on the iris, will 
control the borer.  However, it is recommended to dig 
infested plant out entirely, put it a plastic bag, and 
then place it in the garbage can to avoid 
contamination of other plants.

Milkweed (Asclepias species) and dogbane 
(Apocynum cannibinum) were traditionally burned by 
native people in the fall to maintain vigorous plant 
production, to stimulate plant growth, to optimize 
long and abundant fiber production from leaves and 
stalks, and to stimulate seed production.  It is 
probable that iris was burned for the same reasons.

Ethnobotanic: Iris makes some of the finest cordage.  
The fibers are particularly strong, flexible, and fine 
like silk.  Only two fibers can be taken from each iris 
leaf margin.  Huge bunches of leaves were harvested 
in the fall and stored until needed.  Iris cordage was 
used for fishing nets, string, rope, snares, hairnets, 
and regalia. 
 
The men knotted the fishing nets from iris fibers.  
Animals were captured with iris rope.  A deer rope is 
nearly 20 feet long with a lasso at one end, and about 
half an inch in diameter.  A loop was set over a deer 
trail to catch the head or antlers.  Within the loop

In spite of the tremendous labor of preparing this 
material, the iris fiber was one of the most generally 
employed in northwestern California.  The threads

Since iris is fine and can be bent at sharp angles, it

General: Iris Family (Iridaceae).  Virginia iris is a 
perennial plant.  The slightly fragrant flowers (4 cm 
long, 7 cm across) consist of 3 horizontal sepals, or 
“falls,” and 3 erect petals.  The petals and sepals can 
vary in color from dark-violet to pinkish-white.  The 
sepals have a splash of yellow to yellow-orange at the 
crest.  Each plant has 2 to 6 flowers that bloom from 
April to May upon a single, erect, 3-9 dm tall stalk.  
The stalk is sometimes branched and has a slight 
zigzag appearance.  The plant has 2 to 4 erect or 
arching, bright green, lance-shaped leaves that are 
flattened into one plane at the base.  Leaves are 1 – 3 
cm wide and are sometimes longer than the flower 
stalk.  The fleshy roots (1-2 cm in diameter) are 
rhizomes that spread underground.  Pale brown, 
variably shaped seeds are born in three-part fruit 
capsules (3-6 cm long, 1-2 cm wide).   
 
Distribution: Virginia iris is common along the 
coastal plain from Florida to Georgia.  For current 
distribution, please consult the Plant Profile page for 
this species on the PLANTS Web site.

Juncus species are also dyed yellow in an infusion of 
indigo bush (Psorothamnus emoryi) (Barrows 1967. 
Merrill 1970).  
 
The early sprouts of Baltic rush were sometimes 
eaten raw by the Snuqualmi of Washington (Gunther 
1973).  Juncus shoots were eaten raw, roasted in 
ashes, or boiled by Maidu, Luiseño, and others 
(Strike 1994).  Owens Valley Paiute ate the seeds. 
 
Other Uses: Wildlife habitat and food, erosion 
prevention, sediment retention, basketry, food, tatami 
mats, and nutrient transformation.  Baltic rush has 
nitrogen-fixing capabilities.  They are useful for 
stabilization and revegetation of disturbed areas.  
These plants can be invasive. 
 
Juncus species are used by a wide range of mammal 
and avian species for food and habitat (Hoag and 
Zierke 1998).  Rush seeds are eaten by waterfowl, 
songbirds, small mammals, jack rabbits, cottontail, 
muskrat, porcupine, quail, and gopher (Martin 1951).  
Rushes help improve habitat for amphibians and 
spawning areas for fish.  Muskrats feed on the roots 
and rhizomes of soft rush, and various wetland 
wading birds find shelter among the stems. 
 
Cattle generally do not graze rushes, because they 
have low palatability.  Cattle will graze Baltic rush 
late in the season after more palatable plants are 
eaten.  Rushes provide the following conservation 
uses. erosion control, sediment accretion and 
stabilization, nutrient uptake and transformation, 
wildlife food and cover, restoration and creation of 
wetland ecosystems, and wastewater treatment 
applications.  The rhizomatous nature, nitrogen 
fixation capabilities, dense root system, and 
phenotypic plasticity to flooding and drought stress 
provide high soil and slope stabilization capabilities, 
particularly in areas with flooded soils or fluctuating 
hydrology.  Rushes tend to be resistant to grazing 
pressure and fairly unpalatable to cattle, so tend to 
increase in species composition in stockwater ponds 
and troughs.  The rhizomes form a matrix for many 
beneficial bacteria, making this plant an excellent 
addition for wastewater treatment.

grasslike, usually tufted herbs with terete leaves.  The 
leaf sheaths are clustered at the base, 2-15 cm long, 
multi-colored from red to light to dark brown, and 
bladeless.  The lowest bract of the Baltic rush 
inflorescence is round and 2-20 cm long.  This bract 
appear to be a continuation of the stem.  The 
inflorescence forms a loose to compact panicle of 10-
50 flowers up to 6 cm long.  Flowers are greenish or 
brownish, sessile to pedicellate, each subtended by a 
pair of hyaline-scarious bracts.  Tepals are 3.5-5 mm 
long.  The 6 stamens have anthers 1.5-2.5 mm long.  
Fruits are brownish red and about the size of ground 
pepper (0.6-0.8 mm long).  The fruits are found in a 
capsule.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Adaptation: Juncus species can tolerate shade and 
flooded, anoxic soil conditions, at least periodically.  
They can also tolerate mild to moderate soil salinities 
and alkaline to calcareous soils.  Often these plants 
are found on drier or seasonally fluctuating wetland 
sites (for example, desert playas) and can tolerate 
seasonal drought.   
 
Juncus species may be planted from bare rootstock or 
seedlings from container stalk or directly seeded into 
the soil.  Bare rootstock or seedlings are preferred 
revegetation methods where there is moving water. 
 
Live Plant Collections: The following information on 
Baltic rush is provided by J. Chris Hoag and Mike 
Zierke, USDA, Natural Resources Conservation 
Service, Plant Materials Center, Aberdeen, Idaho.  
 
&quot.Planting plugs (either from the greenhouse or wild 
transplants) is the surest way to establish a new stand 
of this species.  Plug spacing of 25-30 cm will fill in 
within one growing season.  Soil should be kept from 
saturated conditions up to 8 cm of standing water.  
Fluctuating the water level during the establishment 
period may speed spread. Water levels can be 
managed to enhance spread and control weeds.&quot.  
 
 
 
To collect wild plants, no more than 1/4 of the plants 
in an area should be collected.  If no more than 0.09 
m2 (1 ft2) should be removed from a 0.4 m2 (4 ft2) 
area, the plants will grow back into the hole in one 
good growing season.  A depth of 15 cm (6 in) is 
sufficiently deep for digging plugs.  This will leave 
enough plants and rhizomes to grow back during the 
growing season.  
 
Clip leaves and stems to 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 inches). 
this allows the plant to allocate more energy into root 
production.  Transplants should be planted as soon as 
possible in moist (not flooded or anoxic) soils.  Plants 
should be transported and stored in a cool location 
prior to planting.  Plugs may be split into smaller 
units, generally no smaller than 6 x 6 cm (2.4 x 2.4 
in), with healthy rhizomes and tops.  The important 
factor in live plant collections is to be sure to include 
a growing bud in either plugs or rhizomes.  Weeds in 
the plugs should be removed by hand.  Soil can either 
be left on the roots of harvested material or removed.  
For ease in transport, soil may be washed gently from 
roots.  The roots should always remain moist or in 
water until planted.  
 
Soil should be kept saturated after planting.  Plants 
can tolerate 2.5 - 8 cm of standing water as long as 
the level fluctuates over the growing season.  Allow 
roots to become established before flooding soils if 
possible.  Ideally, plants should be planted in late fall 
just after the first rains (usually late October to 
November).  This enables plant root systems to 
become established before heavy flooding and winter 
dormancy occurs.  Survival is highest when plants are 
dormant and soils are moist.  
 
Fertilization is very helpful for plant growth and 
reproduction.  Many more seeds are produced with 
moderate fertilization. 
 
Seed Collections 
•  For Baltic rush near Aberdeen, Idaho, the 
flowering period is late May to August, 
occasionally to September.  Seed ripens in early 
August.  Phenology will differ with plant 
growing in different areas, and for different 
Juncus species. 
•  Seed may be collected by hand, using a pair of 
hand shears, or with a gas-powered handheld 
seed harvester. 
•  The tiny, black seeds are easily lost from the 
capsules when collecting by hand.  Be careful to 
keep capsules upright before putting in collection

this species. 
•  To clean the seed, run the collection through a 
hammer mill to break up debris and knock the 
seeds loose.  Use a 1/20 inch screen on the top 
and a solid sheet on the bottom of the seed 
cleaner.  Adjust the airflow to blow off the chaff.  
The cleaning process can be speeded up by 
shaking the hammermilled collection to settle 
seed to the bottom of the pan.  The top portion of 
the chaff can then be discarded and the seed-rich 
mixture that is left in the bottom can be run 
through the seed cleaner.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='Hydrology is the most important factor in 
determining wetland type, revegetation success, and 
wetland function and value.  Changes in water levels 
influence species composition, structure, and 
distribution of plant communities.  Water 
management is absolutely critical during plant 
establishment, and remains crucial through the life of 
the wetland for proper community management.  
Juncus species can tolerate periods of drought and 
total inundation.  It is important to keep transplanted 
plugs moist, not flooded, until roots are established.  
Water levels can then be managed to enhance or 
reduce spread as well as control terrestrial weeds.  
 
Muskrats have evolved with wetland ecosystems and 
form a valuable component of healthy functioning 
wetland communities.  Muskrats use emergent 
wetland vegetation such as Juncus species for hut 
construction and for food.  Typically, an area of open 
water is created around the huts.  Muskrat cleared 
areas increase wetland diversity by providing 
opportunities for aquatic vegetation to become 
established in the open water and the huts provide a 
substrate for shrubs and other plant species.  
Muskrats opening up the dense stands of emergent 
vegetation also create habitat for other species.  
 
Traditional Resource Management: According to one 
Northern Diegueño basketweaver, most weavers have 
favorite collecting areas where the Juncus is 
plentiful, long, tough, deeply colored with red, or 
simply nearby.  Any Juncus stand will have plants 
that are immature, mature but still in seed, and those 
starting to senesce.  Plants can be harvested during 
any month or season.  The stalks are cut above the 
rhizomes and roots, leaving plenty of buds to re-grow 
new shoots.  As with other rhizomatous species, 
harvest stimulates new growth and maintains the 
clone in a juvenile or immature growth phase, where 
productivity is highest.  Attempts at harvesting 
during times of heavy rain or flooding are likely to 
fail, as deep water and mud make plants inaccessible.  
 
Juncus species tend to be fairly resilient to insect and 
disease problems.  Aphids may feed on the stems, but 
rarely cause significant damage.  If an insect or 
disease problem is encountered in the greenhouse, 
treatment options may be limited by cultural 
constraints if these plants are to be used by Indian 
basket weavers.  Juncus culms are split with the 
mouth to process basketry materials. therefore, an 
unusually high degree of human exposure and risk 
occur with plants designated for ethnobotanic use.  
Rushes are perennial, rhizomatous plants.  In most 
cases, they will out-compete other species within the 
wetland area of the site, eliminating the need for 
manual or chemical control of invasive species.

SOFT RUSH 
Juncus effusus L.

Soft rush, also called candle rush by the Japanese, is 
used for tatami mats.  Large mats were also made by  
 
California Indians by piercing holes in Juncus and 
threading cordage through the holes so the Juncus 
stalks were aligned side-by-side (Strike 1994).  These 
flexible mats could be rolled and stored when not 
needed. 
 
Wildlife: A wide range of mammal and avian species 
depend on Juncus species for food and habitat (Hoag 
and Zierke 1998).  Waterfowl, songbirds, and small 
mammals such as jack rabbits, cottontail, muskrat, 
porcupine, and gophers (Martin 1951) eat rush seeds.  
Rushes provide habitat for amphibians and spawning 
areas for fish.  Muskrats feed on the rootstalks of soft 
rush, and various wetland wading birds find shelter 
among the stems. 
 
Livestock: Cattle will graze Juncus effusus late in the 
season after more palatable plants are eaten.  Rushes 
tend to be resistant to grazing pressure and fairly 
unpalatable to cattle, so tend to increase in species 
composition in pastures. 
 
Erosion &amp. Restoration: Rushes provide the following 
conservation uses: erosion control, sediment 
accretion and stabilization, nutrient uptake and 
transformation, wildlife food and cover, restoration 
and creation of wetland ecosystems, and wastewater 
treatment applications.  The rhizomatous nature, 
nitrogen fixation capabilities, dense root system, and 
phenotypic plasticity to flooding and drought stress 
provide high soil and slope stabilization capabilities, 
particularly in areas with flooded soils or fluctuating 
hydrology.  The rhizomes form a matrix for many 
beneficial bacteria, making this plant an excellent 
addition for wastewater treatment.  This species can 
have invasive characteristics in certain situations.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Uses='Ethnobotanic: Coiled basketry prevails in Southern 
California, with the mottled yellowish brown of soft 
rush providing a natural colored and variegated 
background (Turnbaugh and Turnbaugh 1986).  
Juncus stems are used in the coiled baskets of 
Southern California tribes such as the Cahuilla, 
Luiseño, Chumash, Diegueño, Agua Caliente, 
Gabrieliño, Juaneño, Death Valley Shoshone, and 
Fernandeno (Barrows 1967. Murphey 1959).  The 
foundation material is made of Juncus balticus and 
Juncus effusus, and the sewing material is made of 
Juncus textilis.  The Quinalt of western Washington 
used soft rush for plaiting tumplines for baskets 
(Gunther 1973).  They also mixed soft rush with 
cattails to make string.  The Snoqualmie used the 
stalks for tying things. 
 
The early sprouts of soft rush were sometimes eaten 
raw by the Snoqualmie of Washington (Gunther 
1973).  Juncus shoots were eaten raw, roasted in 
ashes, or boiled by Maidu, Luiseño, and others 
(Strike 1994).  Owens Valley Paiute ate the seeds.  
Soft rush stalks was gathered in wetlands and was 
eaten on occasion by the Nlaka pamux and Lillooet 
people of British Columbia (Kunlein and Turner 
1991).

basal sheaths are bladeless or the inner ones tipped 
with a short awn, the edges usually overlapping 
nearly to the subtruncate or emarginate tip, with the 
veins converging at the tip.  The leaves are dull 
chocolate brown or chestnut-colored at the base, the 
inner sheaths dark toward the summit.  The 
inflorescence is a many-flowered, loosely clustered 
panicle, 2- 10 cm long.  The capsule is oblong-
obovoid, of about the same length as the perianth, 
obtuse or retuse.  The seeds are retucilate.   
 
Distribution: For current distribution, please consult 
the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site.  Soft rush occurs in wet places on 
hillsides or valley flats below 2500 m.  It occurs 
through California to British Columbia, the eastern 
United States, Mexico, and Eurasia.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Juncus effusus is easily propagated from bare root 
stock or seedlings, from container stalk, or directly 
seeded into the soil.  Bare root stock or seedlings are 
preferred revegetation methods where there is 
moving water.  These plants can be invasive.  They 
are useful for stabilization and revegetation of 
disturbed areas.  Juncus effusus requires moderate 
summer watering (irrigation), generally 1 - 4 times 
per month depending on the absorption rate and 
water retention capacity of the soil.  Salt rush plants 
may need to have their roots in moist or wet soils.  
These native plants are especially good for stabilizing 
or restoring disturbed or degraded areas for erosion 
and slope control. 
 
Live Plant Collections: The following information on 
Juncus balticus is provided by J. Chris Hoag and 
Mike Zierke (USDA, NRCS, Plant Materials Center, 
Aberdeen, Idaho).  Due to their taxonomic and 
habitat similarity, it is likely that Juncus effusus 
establishes in a similar manner. 
•  Planting plugs is the surest way to establish a 
new stand of this species.  Plug spacing of 25-30 
cm will fill in within one growing season.  
Fluctuating the water level during the 
establishment period may speed spread of 
Juncus.  Water levels can be managed to enhance 
spread and control weeds.   
•  Clip leaves and stems to 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 
inches) before planting. this allows the plant to 
allocate more energy into root production.  
Transplants should be planted as soon as 
possible in moist (not flooded or anoxic) soils.  
Plants should be transported and stored in a cool 
location prior to planting.  The roots should 
always remain moist or in water until planted.   
 
 
•  Soil should be kept saturated after planting.  
Plants can tolerate 2.5 - 8 cm of standing water 
as long as the level fluctuates over the growing 
season.  Allow roots to become established 
before flooding soils if possible. 
Ideally, plants should be planted in late fall just 
after the first rains (usually late October to 
November).  Survival is highest when plants are 
dormant and soils are moist.   
• 
•  Fertilization is very helpful for plant growth and 
reproduction.  Many more seeds are produced 
with moderate fertilization. 
 
Seed Collections: The flowering period is late May to 
August, occasionally to September.  Seed ripens in 
early August.  Phenology will change by area, aspect, 
elevation, and specific site conditions. 
•  Seed may be collected by hand, using a pair of 
hand shears, or with a gas-powered handheld 
seed harvester. 
•  The tiny, black seeds are easily lost from the 
capsules when collecting by hand.  Be careful to 
keep capsules upright before putting in collection 
bag.  Use paper sacks when collecting seeds for 
this species. 
•  To clean the seed, run the collection through a 
hammermill to break up debris and knock the 
seeds loose.  Use a 1/20 inch screen on the top 
and a solid sheet on the bottom of the seed 
cleaner.  Adjust the air flow to blow off the 
chaff.  The cleaning process can be speeded up 
by shaking the hammermilled collection to settle 
seed to the bottom of the pan.  The top portion of 
the chaff can then be discarded and the seed-rich 
mixture that is left in the bottom can be run 
through the seed cleaner.

should be kept hot (32-38°C).   
•  Seeds begin to germinate in approximately 1 
week.  Maintain soil moisture until plants are to

' WHERE symbol='juef';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='Hydrology is the most important factor in 
determining wetland type, revegetation success, and 
wetland function and value.  Changes in water levels 
influence species composition, structure, and 
distribution of plant communities.  Water 
management is absolutely critical during plant 
establishment, and remains crucial through the life of 
the wetland for proper community management 
(Hoag et al. 1995).  Juncus species can tolerate 
periods of drought and total inundation.  It is 
important to keep transplanted plugs moist, not 
flooded, until roots are established.  Water levels can 
then be managed to enhance or reduce spread as well 
as control terrestrial weeds.   
 
Muskrats have evolved with wetland ecosystems and 
form a valuable component of healthy functioning 
wetland communities.  Muskrats use emergent 
wetland vegetation such as Juncus species for hut 
construction and for food.  Typically, an area of open 
water is created around the huts.  Muskrat eatouts 
increase wetland diversity by providing opportunities 
for aquatic vegetation to become established in the 
open water and the huts provide a substrate for shrubs 
and other plant species.   
 
Juncus species tend to be fairly resilient to insect and 
disease problems.  Aphids may feed on the stems, but 
rarely cause significant damage.  If an insect or 
disease problem is encountered in the greenhouse, 
treatment options may be limited by cultural 
constraints if these plants are to be used by Indian 
basketweavers.  Pesticide exposure is higher for 
basketweavers than the rest of the population.  Juncus 
culms are split with the mouth to process basketry 
materials. therefore, an unusually high degree of 
human exposure and risk occur with plants 
designated for ethnobotanic use.  Rushes are 
perennial, rhizomatous plants.  In most cases, they 
will out-compete other species within the wetland 
area of the site, eliminating the need for manual or 
chemical control of invasive species. 
 
Traditional Resource Management: The management 
of Juncus effusus stands includes the following: 
ownership of prime basket rush sites, stimulation of 
new growth through harvesting stalks, periodic 
burning, and not harvesting when soils are very 
mucky and likely to be compacted.  The stalks are cut 
above the rhizomes and roots, leaving plenty of buds 
to regrow new shoots.  As with other rhizomatous 
species, harvesting stimulates new growth and 
 
 
maintains the clone in a juvenile or immature growth 
phase, where productivity is highest.

species are also dyed yellow in an infusion of indigo 
bush (Psorothamnus emoryi) (Barrows 1967. Merrill 
1970).   
 
Other Uses: A wide range of mammal and avian 
species for food and habitat (Hoag and Zierke 1998) 
uses Juncus species.  Waterfowl, songbirds and small 
mammals such as jack rabbits, cottontail, muskrat, 
porcupine, and gopher (Martin 1951) eats rush seeds.  
Rushes help improve habitat for amphibians and 
spawning areas for fish.  Muskrats feed on the roots 
and rhizomes, and various wetland wading birds find 
shelter among the stems. 
 
Rushes provide the following conservation uses: 
erosion control, sediment accretion and stabilization, 
nutrient uptake and transformation, wildlife food and 
cover, restoration and creation of wetland 
ecosystems, and wastewater treatment applications.  
The rhizomatous nature, nitrogen fixation 
capabilities, dense root system, and phenotypic 
plasticity to flooding and drought stress provide high 
soil and slope stabilization capabilities, particularly in 
areas with flooded soils or fluctuating hydrology.  
The rhizomes form a matrix for many beneficial 
bacteria, making this plant an excellent addition for 
wastewater treatment.  Rushes tend to be resistant to 
grazing pressure and fairly unpalatable to cattle, so 
they tend to increase in species composition in 
stockwater ponds and troughs.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Description='General: Rush Family (Juncaceae).  Juncus lesueurii 
is a grasslike, perennial, rhizomatous wetland plant.  
Salt rush has stems that are 3-9 dm tall, stout, 
smooth, erect or aching, with a distinctive twist to the 
stems.  The stems arise from stout, creeping 
rhizomes.  The terete leaf sheaths are bladeless, and 
shining or light brown in color.  The inflorescence 
appears lateral with open branches, the lowest bract 
cylindric, with many flowers.  The capsule is oblong-
ovoid, light brown, and three-angled.  This species is 
sometimes confused with Juncus balticus, from 
which it may be distinguished by its longer and 
usually darker-colored segments.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Adaptation: Salt rush grows in salt marshes or sand 
dunes along the California coast from Ventura 
County north to British Columbia.  Juncus lesueurii 
can tolerate mild to moderate soil salinity and 
flooded soil conditions.  Often these plants are found 
on drier or seasonally fluctuating wetland sites (for 
example, dune swales) and can tolerate periodic 
drought.   
 
General: Juncus species may be planted from bare 
rootstock or seedlings, from container stalk or 
directly seeded into the soil.  Bare rootstock or 
seedlings are preferred revegetation methods where 
there is moving water.  Juncus lesueurii requires 
moderate summer watering (irrigation), generally 1 - 
4 times per month depending on the absorption rate 
and water retention capacity of the soil.  Salt rush 
plants may need to have their roots in moist or wet 
soils.  These native plants are especially good for 
stabilizing or restoring disturbed or degraded areas 
for erosion and slope control.  Salt rush may become 
invasive.   
 
Live Plant Collections: J. Chris Hoag and Mike 
Zierke (USDA, NRCS, Plant Materials Center, 
Aberdeen, Idaho) provided the following information 
on Juncus balticus.  Due to their taxonomic and 
habitat similarity, it is likely that Juncus lesueurii 
establishes in a similar manner.  Planting plugs is the 
surest way to establish a new stand of this species.  
Plug spacing of 25-30 cm will fill in within one 
growing season.  Fluctuating the water level during 
the establishment period may speed spread of the 
 
 
Plants can tolerate 2.5 - 8 cm of standing water 
as long as the level fluctuates over the growing 
season.  Allow roots to become established 
before flooding soils if possible. 
Ideally, plants should be planted in late fall just 
after the first rains (usually late October to 
November).  Survival is highest when plants are 
dormant and soils are moist.   
• 
rush.  Water levels can be managed to enhance 
spread and control weeds.   
•  Clip leaves and stems to 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 
inches) before planting. this allows the plant to 
allocate more energy into root production.  
Transplants should be planted as soon as 
possible in moist (not flooded or anoxic) soils.  
Plants should be transported and stored in a cool 
location prior to planting.  The roots should 
always remain moist or in water until planted.   
•  Soil should be kept saturated after planting.  
•  Fertilization is very helpful for plant growth and 
reproduction.  Many more seeds are produced 
with moderate fertilization. 
 
Seed Collections: 
•  The flowering period is late May to August, 
occasionally to September.  Seed ripens in early 
August.  Phenology will change by area, aspect, 
elevation, and specific site conditions. 
•  Seed may be collected by hand, using a pair of 
hand shears, or with a gas-powered handheld 
seed harvester. 
•  The tiny, black seeds are easily lost from the 
capsules when collecting by hand.  Be careful to 
keep capsules upright before putting in collection 
bag.  Use paper sacks when collecting seeds for 
this species. 
•  To clean the seed, run the collection through a 
hammer mill to break up debris and knock the 
seeds loose.  Use a 1/20 inch screen on the top 
and a solid sheet on the bottom of the seed 
cleaner.  Adjust the air flow to blow off the 
chaff.  Shaking the hammer milled collection to 
settle seed to the bottom of the pan can speed up 
the cleaning process.  The top portion of the 
chaff can then be discarded and the seed-rich 
mixture that is left in the bottom can be run 
through the seed cleaner.   
 
Seed germination in greenhouse: 
•  Seeds need light, moisture and heat for 
germination.  Soaking the seeds in water for 1 - 7 
days will decrease the time the seed takes to 
sprout.   
•  To grow seeds, place on soil surface and press in 
lightly to assure good soil contact.  Do not cover 

Page 3
the seed.  Soil should be kept moist.  Greenhouse 
should be kept hot (32-38°C).   
•  Seeds begin to germinate in approximately 1 
week.  Maintain soil moisture until plants are to 
be transplanted.  Seedlings cannot withstand 
long periods without water while growing in the 
greenhouse. 
•  Plants are ready in 100 - 120 days to come out as 
plugs.  By planting seeds in August, plugs are 
ready to plant in soil by November.  These plants 
are very small. growing plants to a larger size 
will result in increased revegetation success.   
 
' WHERE symbol='jule';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='Hydrology is the most important factor in 
determining wetland type, revegetation success, and 
wetland function and value.  Changes in water levels 
influence species composition, structure, and 
distribution of plant communities.  Water 
management is absolutely critical during plant 
establishment, and remains crucial through the life of 
the wetland for proper community management 
(Hoag et al. 1995).  Juncus species can tolerate 
periods of drought and total inundation.  It is 
important to keep transplanted plugs moist, not 
flooded, until roots are established.  Water levels can 
then be managed to either enhance or reduce spread 
as well as control terrestrial weeds.   
 
Muskrats have evolved with wetland ecosystems and 
form a valuable component of healthy functioning 
wetland communities.  Muskrats use emergent 
wetland vegetation such as Juncus species for hut 
construction and for food.  Typically, an area of open 
water is created around the huts.    
 
Juncus species tend to be fairly resilient to insect and 
disease problems.  Aphids may feed on the stems, but 
rarely cause significant damage.  If an insect or 
disease problem is encountered in the greenhouse, 
treatment options may be limited by cultural 
constraints if these plants are to be used by Indian 
basket weavers.  Juncus culms are split with the 
mouth to process basketry materials. therefore, an 
unusually high degree of human exposure and risk 
occur with plants designated for ethnobotanic use.  
Rushes are perennial, rhizomatous plants.  In most 
cases, they will out-compete other species within the 
wetland area of the site, eliminating the need for 
manual or chemical control of invasive species. 
 
Traditional Resource Management: Management of 
Juncus lesueurii stands includes the following: 
ownership of prime basket rush sites, stimulation of 
new growth through harvesting stalks, periodic 
burning, and not harvesting when soils are very 
mucky and likely to be compacted.  According to one 
Northern Diegueño basket weaver, most weavers 
have favorite collecting areas where the basket rush 
is plentiful and having characteristics valued by 
basket weavers (long, flexible, tough stems, deep red 
color, access is available and relatively easy).  Any 
Juncus stand will have plants that are immature, 
those which are mature but still in seed, and those 
which are starting to senesce.  The stalks are cut 
above the rhizomes and roots, leaving plenty of buds 
to re-grow new shoots.  As with other rhizomatous 
species, harvesting stimulates new growth and 
maintains the clone in a juvenile or immature growth 
phase, where productivity is highest.  The only 
harvesting prohibition might be during times of 
heavy rain or flooding, when deep water and mud 
make many plants inaccessible.

mixed with Populus leaves this root tea became a 
liniment for stiff back or backaches (McClintock 
1909, Johnston 1970, Hellson 1974). 
 
The Cheyennes steeped the leaves of the Rocky 
Mountain juniper and drank the resulting tea to 
relieve persistent coughing or a tickling in the throat.  
It was also believed to produce sedative effects that 
were especially useful for calming a hyperactive 
person.  Cheyenne women drank juniper tea to speed 
delivery during childbirth (Grinnell 1962).  The 
Cheyenne, along with the Flathead, Nez Perce,  
Kutenai, and Sioux, made a tea from juniper boughs, 
branches, and fleshy cones.  The tea was used as a 
cure for colds, fevers, tonsillitis, and pneumonia 
(Hart 1976). 
 
As a cure for asthma, the Gros Ventres ate whole 
juniper berries or pulverized them and boiled them to 
make a tea.  They also made a preparation from the 
leaves mixed with the root, which they applied 
topically to control bleeding (Kroeber 1908).  The 
Crow drank this medicinal tea to check diarrhea and 
to stop lung or nasal hemorrhage.  Crow women 
drank it after childbirth for cleansing and healing 
(Hart 1976).  
 
The wood of red cedar is very durable, and is used 
for lance shafts, bows, and other items.  Flutes made 
from juniper wood were highly regarded by the 
Cheyenne. 
 
Ornamental: All of the native junipers are valuable 
ornamental species, and many horticultural varieties 
have been developed.  Rocky Mountain juniper is 
widely used in shelterbelts and wildlife plantings.  
The close-grained, aromatic, and durable wood of 
junipers is used for furniture, interior paneling, 
novelties, and fence posts.  The fruits and young 
branches contain aromatic oil that is used in 
medicines. 
 
Wildlife: Junipers are important to wildlife 
throughout the country.  Their twigs and foliage are 
eaten extensively by hoofed browsers, but the chief 
attraction to wildlife is the bluish-black berry-like 
fruit.  The cedar waxwing is one of the principal 
users of juniper berries, but numerous other birds and 
mammals, both large and small, make these fruits and 
important part of their diet.  In addition to their 
wildlife food value, junipers provide important 
protective and nesting cover.  Chipping sparrows,

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Description TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Description='General: Cypress Family (Cupressaceae).  Rocky 
Mountain cedar (Juniperus scopulorum ) is a medium 
sized dioecious or rarely monoecious tree from 10-20 
m (33-66 ) tall (McGregor et al. 1986, Stephens 
1973).  The evergreen tree is scraggly with rounded 
crown to pyramidal.  The bark is dark reddish-brown 
to grayish in color, thin, fibrous, and usually shreds 
with age.  Leaves are green or blue-green, usually 
barely overlapping and closely appressed, scalelike 
and 0.2-0.3 cm (1/16-1/8&quot.) long or needlelike and 
0.6-1.2 cm (1/4-1/2&quot.) long.  Recessed glands occur on 
the dorsal side of the leaves.  Juniperus scopulorum 
differs from red cedar (J. virginiana) by the blunt 
leaves, the leaves not overlapping, and the longer, 
elliptic glands.  The fruits of J. scopulorum mature in 
the second season, while in J. virginiana fruits 
mature in the first season.  Juniperus  scopulorum is 
usually a more rounded tree and J. virginiana is more 
conical.  
 
Male and female cones are on separate trees.  The 
staminate (male) cones are yellowish-brown, papery, 
solitary at the tips of branchlets, ovoid to ellipsoid, 
and 0.2-0.4 cm (1/16-1/8&quot.) long.  The ovulate 
(female) cones are solitary at the tips of branchlets, 
dark blue or bluish-purple, waxy and berry-like, and 
0.4-0.7 cm (3/16-1/4&quot.) long.  The female cones ripen 
from September through October.  There are 1-3 
seeds per cone, yellow-brown and round, 2-4 mm in 
diameter, ridged near the base and sometimes 
shallowly pitted.

Rocky Mountain juniper grows in prairie hillsides, 
fields, pastures, and occasionally in woodlands, in 
rocky, sandy, or clay soils.  The distribution of Rocky 
Mountain juniper is from British Columbia and 
Alberta south through the Great Basin and the Rocky 
Mountains to Arizona and New Mexico and into 
western Texas, north across eastern Colorado, 
western Nebraska to western North Dakota, and west 
in Montana.  The range overlaps that of Juniperus 
virginiana only in North Dakota.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Rocky Mountain juniper is often used as an 
ornamental because of its evergreen foliage.  Juniper 
can be easily transplanted in the early spring before it 
 
 
starts its new growth.  It is especially well adapted to 
dry areas.  The junipers are generally propagated by 
cuttings.  
' WHERE symbol='jusc2';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_ TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_='Propagation from Cuttings 
Cuttings are made 5 to 15 cm (2 to 65 inches) long 
from new lateral growth tips stripped of older 
branches.  A small piece of old wood, a “heel,” is 
thus left attached to the base of the cutting.  Some 
propagators believe this to be advantageous.  In other 
cases, good results are obtained when the cuttings are 
just clipped without the “heel” from the older wood.  
Cuttings from the current season’s terminal growth 
also root well. 
 
Cuttings to be rooted in the greenhouse can be taken 
at any time during the winter or rooted outdoors on 
heated beds.  Exposing the stock plants to several 
hard freezes seems to give better rooting.  Optimum 
time for taking cuttings is when stock plants have 
ceased growth (i.e. the late fall-winter propagation 
period is more successful than summer).  For 
propagating in an outdoor cold frame, cuttings are 
taken in late summer or early fall.  There may be 
advantages to using bottom heat.  Lightly wounding 
the base of the cuttings is sometimes helpful, and the 
use of root-promoting chemicals, especially IBA, is 
beneficial.  Recommendations for root-promoting 
chemicals include the following: 2500 IBA Quick-
dip (Alabama), 3000 – 8000 ppm IBA liquid, and 
0.3-4.5 percent IBA talc.  A medium-coarse sand or a 
10:1 mixture of perlite and peat moss is a satisfactory 
rooting medium.  Maintenance of a humid 
environment without excessive wetting of the 
cuttings is desirable, as is a relatively high light 
intensity.  A light, intermittent mist can be used.  
Bottom heat of 60-65°F (12°C) is critical the first six 
weeks of propagation to allow the basal wound of 
cuttings to callus.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_SeedPropagation TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_SeedPropagation='Juniperus scopulorum flowers from April to June.  
The fruits should be gathered in the fall (September-
October) as soon as the berry-like cones become ripe.  
Rocky Mountain juniper trees come to seed-bearing 
age in 10-20 years, and they bear cones every 2-5 
years.  Seed collection can be done by stripping or 
picking the berries by hand from the trees, or by 
flailing the fruits to ground cloths.  Be careful to pick 
only ripe berries.  Since the number of filled seeds 
varies widely from tree to tree, it is important to test 
the seeds by cutting to determine percent fill.  Seeds 
may be stored as berries or cleaned seeds. 
 
The seeds can be recovered by macerating the fruits 
and floating the seeds to the top.  The addition of 

Page 3
detergent to the maceration water helps to separate 
seeds from the resinous fruits.  Juniper seeds store 
quite well.  They should be dried to 10-20% moisture 
and stored in a sealed container at cold temperatures. 
 
For best germination, seeds should be removed from 
the fruits, then the seed coat is softened by treating it 
with sulfuric acid for 120 minutes.  After soaking the 
seeds in sulfuric acid, follow with 6 weeks of warm 
stratification at 20 to 30°C (70 to 85°F), or summer 
planting, then 10 weeks of pre-chilling at 4°C (40°F).  
Use of fresh seed reduced the warm stratification 
time.  Rather than the acid treatment, two to three 
months of warm stratification could be used.  As an 
alternative for cold stratification, the seed may be 
sown in the fall.  Germination is delayed at 
temperatures above 15°C (60° F).  Germination is 
often delayed in juniper seeds, as seeds are 
consistently highly dormant.  
 
Juniper seeds are usually sown in the nursery in the 
late summer or fall, but may be sown in spring or 
summer.  The seeds of most species should be sown 
in fall to take advantage of natural pre-chilling. 
 
Juniper seeds are usually drilled in well-prepared 
seedbeds in rows 15 to 20 cm apart and covered with 
0.6 cm of soil.  In nurseries with severe climates, 
such as those in the Great Plains, considerable care 
must be taken to protect the beds with mulch and 
snow fences. 
 
Viability of the seed varies considerably from year to 
year and among lots, but it is never much over 50 
percent.  Treated seed is usually planted in the spring, 
either in outdoor beds or in flats in the greenhouse. 
Two or three years are required to produce plants 
large enough to graft.

yellow.  Juncus stems can be bleached in the summer 
sun for several months to assure a light tan uniform  
 
color.  According to some Diegueño basket weavers, 
the deep brick-red color found in many mission 
baskets was obtained from Juncus species harvested 
in the higher elevations, 3,000 feet or above, and in 
canyons usually under sycamores or willow trees 
(Moser 1993).  The red color occurs under the leaf 
thatch or blanketing vegetation mat and varies from 
several inches to nearly 12 inches in length at the 
base of the Juncus stalk, and is often used alone as a 
design element. 
 
The Cahuilla, Diegeño, Luiseño, and Chumash dye 
the mature rushes black by steeping them for several 
hours in an infusion of either horned sea-blite 
(Suaeda calceoliformis ) or bush seepweed (Suaeda 
moquinii).  This dye is very penetrating, and the color 
is durable, but has a fetid, disagreeable smell.  Juncus 
species are also dyed yellow in an infusion of indigo 
bush (Psorothamnus emoryi) (Barrows 1967. Merrill 
1970).  
 
Juncus stalks can be harvested throughout the year.  
Preparation for basket weaving involves splitting 
each rush stalk into three equal portions.  The base of 
the reed is split using either a thumbnail or pocket 
knife, then one piece is grasped in the teeth and one 
in each hand and equal pressure is applied.  One 
Digeño basket weaver describes a point about half 
way through the reed when the splitting starts to 
&quot.stutter&quot. and feels like its going to break.  At this 
point he throws the remaining parts away.  The pith is 
removed after soaking the plant in water prior to 
weaving.  The individual pieces are then trimmed to a 
uniform thickness.  The stems are soaked in water 
before using. 
 
Other Uses: Juncus species are used by a wide range 
of mammal and avian species for food and habitat 
(Hoag and Zierke 1998).  Rush seeds are eaten by 
waterfowl, songbirds, and small mammals such as 
jackrabbits, cottontails, muskrats, porcupines, and 
gophers (Martin 1951).  Rushes help improve habitat 
for amphibians and spawning areas for fish.  
Muskrats feed on the roots and rhizomes, and various 
wetland wading birds find shelter among the stems. 
 
Rushes provide the following conservation uses: 
erosion control, sediment accretion and stabilization, 
nutrient uptake and transformation, wildlife food and

Ethnobotanic: Coiled basketry prevails in Southern 
California, with the mottled yellowish brown of 
Juncus textilis providing a natural colored and 
variegated background (Turnbaugh and Turnbaugh 
1986).  Juncus stems are used in the coiled baskets of 
Southern California  basketweavers such as the 
Cahuilla, Luiseño, Chumash, Diegueño, Agua 
Caliente, Gabrieliño, Juaneño, Death Valley 
Shoshone, and Fernandeno (Barrows 1967. Murphey

are made with Juncus stems for the tan color and 
roots for the black color (Timbrook 1997).  The 
sewing material is made of Juncus textilis and the 
foundation material is made of Juncus balticus. 
 
Rushes are cut off at ground level, or at the length

cover, restoration and creation of wetland 
ecosystems, and wastewater treatment applications.  
The rhizomatous nature, nitrogen fixation 
capabilities, dense root system, and phenotypic 
plasticity to flooding and drought stress provide high 
soil and slope stabilization capabilities, particularly in 
areas with flooded soils or fluctuating hydrology.  
The rhizomes form a matrix for many beneficial 
bacteria, making this plant an excellent addition for 
wastewater treatment.  Rushes tend to be resistant to 
grazing pressure and fairly unpalatable to cattle, so 
tend to increase in species composition in stock water 
ponds and troughs.  Basket rush is useful for 
stabilization and revegetation of disturbed areas.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Description TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Description='General: Rush Family (Juncaceae).  Basket rush is a 
perennial, rhizomatous wetland plant.  It is a 
grasslike, usually tufted herb 10-20 dm tall, with 
stout, rigid, pale green culms.  The leaf sheaths are 
terete, clustered at the base, 2-15 cm long, multi-
colored from red to tan to dark brown, and bladeless.  
The inflorescence forms a lax panicle with many 
flowers.  The brown, oblong-ovoid capsule is as long 
as or slightly shorter than the perianth, and contains 
many seeds.  Juncus textilis is closely related to 
Juncus balticus. basket rush can be distinguished 
from baltic rush by its much stouter habit, its paler 
green stems, and its somewhat larger, more 
numerous-flowered panicle.  The stems of Juncus 
textilis are more woody in texture, retain their terete 
shape when dried, and do not tend to flatten as do 
those of Juncus balticus.  From this description of 
their growth forms, it is obvious why Juncus textilis 
is used for the sewing material and Juncus balticus is 
compressed inside the coils of baskets.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Distribution TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Distribution='For current distribution, please consult the Plant 
Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
site.  Juncus textilis grows in marshy areas and along 
streams below an elevation of 1800 m.  Basket rush 
grows in coastal and montane southern California, 
north to San Luis Obispo and Kern Counties.  Often 
these plants are found on drier or seasonally 
fluctuating wetland sites (for example, desert playas) 
and can tolerate both seasonal drought and flooding.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Juncus species may be planted from bare rootstock or

revegetation methods where there is moving water. 
 
Live Plant Collections: The following information on 
Juncus balticus is provided by J. Chris Hoag and 
Mike Zierke (USDA, NRCS, Plant Materials Center, 
Aberdeen, Idaho).  Due to their taxonomic and 
habitat similarity, it is likely that Juncus textilis 
establishes in a similar manner.  Planting plugs is the 
surest way to establish a new stand of this species.  
Plug spacing of 25-30 cm will fill in within one 
growing season.  Fluctuating the water level during 
the establishment period may speed the spread of 
Juncus.  Water levels can be managed to enhance 
spread and control weeds. 
 
Clip leaves and stems to 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 inches) 
before planting. this allows the plant to allocate more 
energy into root production.  Transplants should be 
planted as soon as possible in moist (not flooded or 
anoxic) soils.  Plants should be transported and stored 
in a cool location prior to planting.  The roots should 
always remain moist or in water until planted.   
 
Ideally, plants should be planted in late fall just after 
the first rains (usually late October to November).  
Survival is highest when plants are dormant and soils 
are moist.  Soil should be kept saturated after 
planting.  Plants can tolerate 2.5 - 8 cm of standing 
water as long as the level fluctuates over the growing 
season.  Allow roots to become established before 
flooding soils if possible.  Fertilization is very helpful 
for plant growth and reproduction.  Many more seeds 
are produced with moderate fertilization. 
 
Seed Collections: The flowering period is late May to 
August, occasionally to September.  Seed ripens in 
early August.  Phenology will change by area, aspect, 
elevation, and specific site conditions. 
•  Seed may be collected by hand, using a pair of 
hand shears, or with a gas-powered handheld 
seed harvester. 
•  The tiny, black seeds are easily lost from the 
capsules when collecting by hand.  Be careful to 
keep capsules upright before putting in collection 
bag.  Use paper sacks when collecting seeds for 
this species. 
•  To clean the seed, run the collection through a 
hammer mill to break up debris and knock the 
seeds loose.  Use a 1/20 inch screen on the top 
and a solid sheet on the bottom of the seed 
cleaner.  Adjust the air flow to blow off the 
chaff.  The cleaning process can be speeded up 

Page 3
by shaking the hammer milled collection to settle 
seed to the bottom of the pan.  The top portion of 
the chaff can then be discarded and the seed-rich 
mixture that is left in the bottom can be run 
through the seed cleaner.   
 
Seed germination in greenhouse: 
•  Seeds need light, moisture and heat for 
germination.  Soaking the seeds in water for 1 - 7 
days will decrease the time the seed takes to 
sprout.   
•  To grow seeds, place on soil surface and press in 
lightly to assure good soil contact.  Do not cover 
the seed.  Soil should be kept moist.  Greenhouse 
should be kept hot (32-38°C).   
•  Seeds begin to germinate in approximately 1 
week.  Maintain soil moisture until plants are to 
be transplanted.  Seedlings cannot withstand 
long periods without water while growing in the 
greenhouse. 
•  Plants are ready in 100 - 120 days to come out as 
plugs.  By planting seeds in August, plugs are 
ready to plant in soil by November.  These plants 
are very small. growing plants to a larger size 
will result in increased revegetation success.   
 
' WHERE symbol='jute2';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='Hydrology is the most important factor in 
determining wetland type, revegetation success, and 
wetland function and value.  Changes in water levels 
influence species composition, structure, and 
distribution of plant communities.  Water 
management is absolutely critical during plant 
establishment, and remains crucial through the life of 
the wetland for proper community management 
(Hoag et al. 1995).  Juncus species can tolerate 
periods of drought and total inundation.  It is 
important to keep transplanted plugs moist, not 
flooded, until roots are established.  Water levels can 
then be managed to either enhance or reduce spread 
as well as control terrestrial weeds.   
 
Juncus species tend to be fairly resilient to insect and 
disease problems.  Aphids may feed on the stems, but 
rarely cause significant damage.  If an insect or 
disease problem is encountered in the greenhouse, 
treatment options may be limited by cultural 
constraints if these plants are to be used by Indian 
basket weavers.  Juncus culms are split with the 
mouth to process basketry materials. therefore, an 
unusually high degree of human exposure and risk 
occur with plants designated for ethnobotanic use.  
Rushes are perennial, rhizomatous plants.  In most 
cases, they will out-compete other species within the 
wetland area of the site, eliminating the need for 
manual or chemical control of invasive species. 
 
 
 
Traditional Resource Management: Management of 
Juncus textilis stands includes the following: 
ownership of prime basket rush sites, stimulation of 
new growth through harvesting stalks, periodic 
burning, and not harvesting when soils are very 
mucky and likely to be compacted.  According to one 
Northern Diegueño basket weaver, most weavers 
have favorite collecting areas where the basket rush 
is plentiful and having characteristics valued by 
basket weavers (long, flexible, tough stems, deep red 
color, access is available and relatively easy).  Any 
Juncus stand will have immature plants, mature but 
still in seed, and those starting to senesce.  The stalks 
are cut above the rhizomes and roots, leaving plenty 
of buds to re-grow new shoots.  As with other 
rhizomatous species, harvesting stimulates new 
growth and maintains the clone in a juvenile or 
immature growth phase, where productivity is 
highest.  The only harvesting prohibition might be 
during times of heavy rain or flooding, when deep 
water and mud make many plants inaccessible.

The Blackfeet made a tea from the berries of the red 
cedar to stop vomiting (Kindscher 1992).  A  
 
 
blackfeet remedy for arthritis and rheumatism was to 
boil red cedar leaves in water, add one-half teaspoon  
of turpentine, and when cooled, rub the mixture on 
affected parts.  The Blackfeet also drank a tea made 
from red cedar root as a general tonic. mixed with 
Populus leaves this root tea became a liniment for 
stiff backs or backache (McClintock 1909, Johnston 
1970, Hellson 1974). 
 
The Cheyenne steeped the leaves of the red cedar and 
drank the resulting tea to relieve persistent coughing 
or a tickling in the throat.  It was also believed to 
produce sedative effects that were especially useful 
for calming a hyperactive person.  Cheyenne women 
drank the red cedar tea to speed delivery during 
childbirth (Grinnell 1962).  The Cheyenne, along 
with the Flathead, Nez Perce, Kutenai, and Sioux, 
made a tea from red cedar boughs, branches, and 
fleshy cones, which they drank for colds, fevers, 
tonsillitis, and pneumonia (Hart 1976). 
 
As a cure for asthma, the Gros Ventres ate whole red 
cedar berries or pulverized them and boiled them to 
make a tea.  They also made a preparation from the 
leaves mixed with the root, which they applied 
topically to control bleeding (Kroeber 1908).  The 
Crows drank this medicinal tea to check diarrhea and 
to stop lung or nasal hemorrhage.  Crow women 
drank it after childbirth for cleansing and healing 
(Hart 1976).  
 
The young leafy twigs of the red cedar were officially 
listed in the U.S. Pharmacopoeia from 1820 to 1894 
as a diuretic (Kindscher 1992).  The distilled oil of 
the red cedar has been officially listed as a reagent in 
the U.S. Pharmacopoeia since 1916 (ibid.).  
 
The wood of red cedar is very durable, and was used 
for lance shafts, bows, and other items.  Flutes made 
from red cedar wood were highly regarded by the 
Cheyenne.  Cedar boughs were used for bedding. The 
Menomini wove mats of cedar bark.  The mats were 
used for roofing temporary structures, for partitions, 
floor mats and wrappings, and for various purposes in 
the canoes.

Red cedars are often used as ornamentals for their 
evergreen foliage.  Most cemetery plantings include 
old red cedar trees and many younger dwarf junipers.  
All of the native junipers are valuable ornamental 
species, and many horticultural varieties have been 
developed.  Red cedar is widely used in shelterbelts 
and wildlife plantings.  The close-grained, aromatic, 
and durable wood of junipers is used for furniture, 
interior paneling, novelties, and fence posts.  The 
fruits and young branches contain aromatic oil that is 
used in medicines. 
 
Wildlife: Red cedar and other junipers are important 
to wildlife throughout the country.  Their twigs and 
foliage are eaten extensively by hoofed browsers, but 
the chief attraction to wildlife is the bluish-black 
berry-like fruit.  The cedar waxwing is one of the 
principal users of red cedar berries, but numerous 
other birds and mammals, both large and small, make 
these fruits an important part of their diet.  In addition 
to their wildlife food value, cedars provide important 
protective and nesting cover.  Chipping sparrows, 
robins, song sparrows, and mockingbirds use these 
trees as one of their favorite nesting sites.  Juncos, 
myrtle warblers, sparrows of various kinds, and other 
birds use the dense foliage as roosting cover.  In 
winter, their dense protective shelter is especially 
valuable.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_='Propagation from Cuttings 
Cuttings are made 5 to 15 cm (2 to 65 inches) long 
from new lateral growth tips stripped of older 
branches.  A small piece of old wood, “a heel,” is 
thus left attached to the base of the cutting.  Some 
propagators believe this to be advantageous.  In other 
cases, good results are obtained when the cuttings are 
just clipped without the “heel” from the older wood.  
Cuttings from the current season’s terminal growth 
also root well. 
 
Cuttings to be rooted in the greenhouse can be taken 
at any time during the winter or rooted outdoors on 
heated beds.  Exposing the stock plants to several 
hard freezes seems to give better rooting.  Optimum 
time for taking cuttings is when stock plants have 
ceased growth (i.e. the late fall-winter propagation 
period is more successful than summer).  For 
propagating in an outdoor cold frame, cuttings are 
taken in late summer or early fall.  There may be 
advantages to using bottom heat.  Lightly wounding 
the base of the cuttings is sometimes helpful, and the 
use of root-promoting chemicals, especially IBA, is 
beneficial.  Recommendations for root-promoting 
chemicals include the following: 2500 IBA Quick-
dip (Alabama), 3000 – 8000 ppm IBA liquid, and 
0.3-4.5 percent IBA talc.  Medium-coarse sand or a 
10:1 mixture of perlite and peat moss is a satisfactory 
rooting medium.  Maintenance of a humid 
environment without excessive wetting of the 
cuttings is desirable, as is a relatively high light 
intensity.  A light, intermittent mist can be used.  
Bottom heat of 60-65°F (12°C) is critical the first six 
weeks of propagation to allow the basal wound of 
cuttings to callus.

years, and they bear cones every 2-3 years.  Seed 
collection can be done by stripping or picking the 
berries by hand from the trees, or by flailing the fruits 
to ground cloths.  Be careful to pick only ripe berries.  
Since the number of filled seeds varies widely from 
tree to tree, it is important to test the seeds by cutting 
to determine percent fill.  Seeds may be stored as 
berries or cleaned seeds. 
 
The seeds can be recovered by macerating the fruits 
and floating the seeds to the top.  The addition of 
detergent to the maceration water helps to separate 
seeds from the resinous fruits.  Red cedar seeds store 
quite well.  They should be dried to 10-20% moisture 
and stored in a sealed container at cold temperatures. 
 
For best germination, seeds should be removed from 
the fruits, then the seed coat is softened by treating it 
with sulfuric acid for 120 minutes.  After soaking the 
seeds in sulfuric acid, follow with 6 weeks of warm 
stratification at 20 to 30°C (70 to 85°F), or summer 
planting, then 10 weeks of pre-chilling at 4°C (40°F).  
Use of fresh seed reduced the warm stratification 
time.  Rather than the acid treatment, two to three 
months of warm stratification could be used.  As an 
alternative for cold stratification, the seed may be 
sown in the fall.  Germination is delayed at 
temperatures above 15°C (60° F).  Germination is 
often delayed in red cedar seeds, as seeds are 
consistently highly dormant.  
 
Red cedar seeds are usually sown in the nursery in 
the late summer or fall, but may be sown in spring or 
summer.  The seeds of most species should be sown 
in fall to take advantage of natural pre-chilling.  Red 
cedar seeds are usually drilled in well-prepared 
seedbeds in rows 15 to 20 cm apart and covered with 
0.6 cm of soil.  In nurseries with severe climates, 
such as those in the Great Plains, considerable care 
must be taken to protect the beds with mulch and 
snow fences. 
 
Viability of the seed varies considerably from year to 
year and among lots, but it is never much over 50 
percent.  Treated seed is usually planted in the spring, 
either in outdoor beds or in flats in the greenhouse.  
Two or three years are required to produce plants 
large enough to graft.

and early settler. The Indians graciously taught them 
how to use it and it was called “Indian tea plant” by 
some non-Indians. The leaves were even used as a 
substitute for tea during the Revolutionary War 
(Hedrick 1972).  Today there is a demand for the 
plant’s essential oil for aromatherapy (Rogers 1997) 
and the plant is planted in gardens as an ornamental 
shrub. 
 
Large quantities of leaves were picked in spring 
before flowering by some native families while 
others picked them year round (Anderson 2009). The 
Ojibwa gathered the leaves from spring to autumn for 
a beverage tea (Smith 1932). The leaves were used 
either fresh or dried for future use. There were a 
number of ways to prepare tea, including adding a 
handful of leaves to boiling water and letting it 
simmer for several minutes or adding a handful of 
leaves to cold water, bringing it to a boil and 
simmering it for much longer (Stewart 2002). The 
Ojibwa, for example, tied fresh or dried leaves in a 
packet using a thin strip of basswood bark before 
placing in water to boil. The quantity was a large 
handful to a quart of water. It was drunk while hot 
and sweetened with maple sugar (Buttree 1932).  
 
Re-enacting an ancient custom, the Hoh, Quinault, 
Quileute, Klallam, and Makah still gather and steep 
the leaves and drink the resulting tea as a refreshing 
beverage (Anderson 2009. Gill 1984). Today, 
different Native American families keep a pot of this 
tea on the stove, ready for serving anytime (Stewart 
2002). Pat Boachup, Makah, (pers. comm.) says: “I 
still gather the leaves of the Indian tea every year. We 
pick off the leaves that have molded or spoiled. We 
collect the good leaves and put them in a warm place 
to dry. If the leaves stay in a plastic bag they will turn 
black. They are put in a paper bag next to a wood 
stove to dry. Then after they are dry you can put them 
in a plastic bag. I take a handful of leaves—enough to 
cover the top of the pot—and put them in the pan or 
pot with water. Take a fork and push down the 
leaves. When it starts boiling turn it down and steam 
it for 15 to 20 minutes.  When it turns a rich orange 
it’s ready. If steamed too long, it turns dark. I drink it 
most of the time hot with sugar. I gather four or five 
grocery bags of dried leaves from two sites every 
year. You can pick it all year round, but I usually go 
in the fall in September and October. I make sure I 
leave some leaves so as not to kill the plant.”

Uses 
Bog Labrador tea leaves are fragrant and were used 
as a beverage and medicine by many tribes such as 
the Quinault and Makah in western Washington, the 
Potawatomi in the Great Lakes region, and the 
Iroquois in the Northeast. This tea was as popular 
among tribes as green tea, chai and black teas are to 
Western culture today (Gunther 1973. Smith 1933. 
Hedrick 1933). First Nations in Canada also picked 
the leaves for a warm drink and medicine (Turner 
2004). 
 
CAUTION: Bog Labrador tea may be toxic in 
concentrated doses. It contains toxic alkaloids 
known to be poisonous to livestock, especially 
sheep (Pojar and MacKinnon 1994). 
  
The beverage was quickly adopted by Europeans 
because of its pleasant flavor, aroma and salutary 
effects (Franklin 1823. Umfreville 1954). It warmed 
the insides of many a non-Indian explorer, trapper,

Wildlife Use: The flowers of bog Labrador tea 
provide nectar for butterflies (Pettinger and Costanzo 
2002). The palm warbler (Dendroica palmarum) and 
Connecticut warbler (Oporornis agilis) nest in 
Sphagnum in bogs with bog Labrador tea and open 
conifer cover (Walkinshaw and Wolf 1957. Huff 
1929). Bog Labrador tea leaves and twigs are 
browsed by caribou and moose.

Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s 
current status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, 
state noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
Description 
General:  Heath family (Ericaceae). An erect, 
aromatic shrub that grows to one meter with twigs 
densely covered with long, soft hairs (villous). The 
narrow, leathery leaves are 2-5 cm long, alternate, 
and evergreen. The leaves are dark green above with 
edges that curl under along the margins, and there is a 
dense mat of orange-brown hairs on the underside. 
Numerous white flowers in tight clusters bloom from 
May to July. Each flower has a small five-toothed 
sepal tube with five separate petals, and 5-7 stamens. 
The fruit is a small, fuzzy capsule tipped with a 
persistent style (Marles et al. 2000. Pettinger and 
Costanzo 2002. Pojar and MacKinnon 1994).

Medicinal Use:  The sophistication and complexity of 
bog Labrador tea’s medicinal use is demonstrated by 
the wide variety of ailments that were treated with 
this plant. Hudson Bay Company writer Edward 
Umfrewille (1954) wrote in 1790 about the Indians 
and Europeans of Canada and how they used the tea 
medicinally: “Its virtues are many. it is an aromatic, 
very serviceable in rheumatic cases, strengthens the 
stomach, relieves the head, and also promotes 
perspiration. Outwardly, it is applied to gangrenes, 
contusions, and excoriations. in the latter case the 
powder is made use of.”  
 
Tribes used the leaves to treat inflammatory 
pathologies such as asthma, rheumatism, and burns. 
diseases of the liver and kidney and many other 
sicknesses (U’mista Cultural Society et al. 1998. 
Gunther 1973). The Makah, for example used a 
strong infusion for a blood purifier (Gunther 1973). 
The leaves were used by the Ojibwa as a medicine 
for treating ulcers (Densmore 1974). Cree and the 
Metis of Canada continue to use it, drunk as a tea or 
leaves chewed and the juice swallowed, to treat 
stomach flu, diarrhea, chills and bad breath, 
pneumonia and difficulty urinating (Marles et al. 
2000). The Innu (formerly the Montagnais-Naskapi) 
of Labrador still treat sore throats and headaches by 
chewing the leaves, but not swallowing (Olsson n.d.). 
The Denyaavee of Alaska still use a tea of the leaves 
for settling upset stomachs, easing heartburn, and 
helping to ease arthritis pain. A tea made from the 
flowers is good for combating a cold. The cooled tea 
is a wash for skin problems and works well for sore 
throats when gargled (Tanana Chiefs Conference, 
Inc. 1999). 
 
Recent studies support its ethnopharmacological use, 
showing significant anti-inflammatory and 
antioxidant activities from methanol extracts of 
leaves and twigs. Bog Labrador tea twig extracts 
were found to be active against lung and colon

Habitat:  Bog Labrador tea grows in bogs, fens, 
muskegs, open tundra, and dwarf shrub communities. 
It covers significant areas in bogs with black and 
white spruce (Picea mariana and Picea glauca), and 
tamarack (Larix laricina) in the boreal forests of 
Canada and high-elevation northeastern United 
States. eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), pitch 
pine (Pinus rigida), eastern white pine (Pinus 
strobus), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), white ash 
(Fraxinus americana), and paper birch (Betula 
papyrifera) in the Northeast and Great Lakes region. 
as an understory shrub in open or closed moist forests 
in association with lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta 
var. contorta), Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) and 
western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) in the Pacific 
coastal forests of Oregon, Washington, Canada, and 
Alaska. and shrub birch (Betula glandulosa) in the 
Yukon (Gleason and Cronquist 1991. Pettinger and 
Costanzo 2002. Strong 2002. Tiner 1991).  
Establishment 
Plants can be started from seed or root-crown 
division. Collect the seeds from dry capsules and 
plant them in fall or spring in a moist peaty soil, in a 
sunny spot. Water them thoroughly after planting and 
keep moist. Suckers with roots can be split off from 
the base of the plant in mid-December and 
transplanted during spring (Pettinger and Costanzo 
2002. MacKenzie 1997. Young and Young 1992. 
Dirr and Heuser 1987). 
Management 
Many of the fens and bogs that provide important 
habitat for bog Labrador tea in North America were 
created by glaciation. These wetlands have been 
disappearing over thousands of years, due to a 
decrease in native ungulates that graze the bogs, and 
encroachment by conifers and hardwoods. Indians in 
different regions burned these wetlands periodically 
(Anderson 2009. Day 1953. Patterson and Sassaman 
1988). The primary role of fire was to maintain open 
habitats such as prairies, bogs, and forest clearings. 
Forest encroachment would have reduced sunlight 
that the bog Labrador tea plants needed, increased 
competition for nutrients, and made the plants more 
difficult to get to and harvest. Burning also had a 
directly beneficial effect on individual plants, 
maintaining vigor and stimulating new growth. Bog 
Labrador tea is fire tolerant (Mallik and Mallik 
1997), responding to low-intensity fires by 
resprouting from stems. If completely top-killed, the 
plant regenerates from root crowns and rhizomes 
(Calmes and Zasada 1982. Parminter 1984). 
Regeneration is typically rapid (Scotter 1972). Indian 
tea can even survive severe fires because the 
rhizomes lie as deep as 50 cm in the soil (Flinn and 
Wein 1977). The young leaves can become infected 
 
 
with a fungal disease, spruce needle rust, leaving 
powdery orange spores (Hiratsuka et al. 1995).  
 
Kate McCarty, a non-Indian woman married to a 
Makah, described bog Labrador tea on the Ts’oo-
yuhs prairie as producing better crops after the 
Makah burned it: “The Labrador tea can just keep 
growing and growing and growing until it gets real 
leggy. And all that you have is just a few little leaves 
on top. But after it’s been burned then it starts all 
over again. It’s just like pinching flowers off of the 
chrysanthemum to make them bush out” (Kate 
McCarty pers. comm.). 
 
Environmental Concerns 
 “People burned in the cranberry marsh to promote a 
better crop of cranberries and Indian tea. Our people 
have been drinking the Indian tea for thousands of 
years.  But you can never drink enough. A lot of 
people like the Indian tea. Another reason to burn 
was to keep the brush and trees from growing. 
Otherwise it would be a loss. The marsh behind the 
school [on the Makah Reservation], unless someone 
burns it, it will be history. It is being encroached by 
trees and shrubs. Unless they’re cut down and 
burned, they’ll eventually take over the cranberry 
marsh just like at Ozette” (Pat Boachup, Makah, pers. 
comm.).

Ethnobotanic: The roots were harvested with a 
digging stick and eaten traditionally by the Washoe, 
Owens Valley Paiute, Northern Paiute, Western 
Shoshone, Gosiute, Northern Shoshone, Eastern 
Shoshone, Utah Southern Paiute, Northern Ute, and 
Flathead.  The roots were also an important food for 
the interior peoples of British Columbia, including 
the Upper Nlaka pamux, southern Shuswap, 
Okanagan-Colville, and southern Kootenay.  Lower 
Nlaka pamux, Lillooet, northern Shuswap and 
northern Kootenay peoples obtained them through 
trade.  Families in some cultural groups still gather 
the roots today.  The roots are prepared for eating by 
removing the bark and boiling, steaming, or pit-
roasting them and they are eaten fresh or dried.  
Because digging the roots destroys the entire plant, 
care should be taken to propagate and harvest the 
plants in ways to maintain populations.

In May when the leaves turn yellow, stop watering 
and put the pots in the hottest spot you have until fall 
when the rains come.  Bitter root requires hot, dry 
summer baking.  Repeat this cycle over two years.  
During the summer or fall of the third year, when the 
plants are dormant, out-plant the plants in full sun 
and in well-drained soil.  Crown the plants at the soil 
surface.  Plant each plant 4-6 inches apart.  Mark the 
spot where you plant bitter root and give the plants 
no water.  Let the rains come.  Protect the plants from 
deer and other wildlife.

storage bins, either above or below ground, to protect 
the dried acorns from robbing squirrels and 
chipmunks.  The Salinan built outdoor acorn 
granaries on the ground next to their homes (Mason 
1912).  The granaries were constructed in a basket-
like fashion from white willow twigs that were then 
covered with grass.  The Pomo used tanoak leaves to 
line aboveground bins that they constructed from 
redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) boughs (Hoover 
1977).  The Costanoan and Chumash stored acorns in 
baskets made from interlaced white willow twigs 
(Brusa  1975).  The baskets were about 1 m in 
diameter at the bottom and sloped up gradually 
inward into a cone about 0.5 m with a 0.5 m opening.   
Hollow tree trunks also served as storage bins 
(Hoover 1971). 
 
The acorns were pounded into flour as needed.  
Stone, bedrock, and wooden mortars were used to 
crush the acorns into a meal.  Sometimes the acorns 
were soaked overnight to help crack open the shells.  
After soaking, the acorns were removed from the 
shells and spread out onto open-work baskets to dry.  
The Salinan cracked open the acorns individually 
using a small, hard stone hammer and then set them 
out in the sun to dry (Mason 1912).  The dried acorns 
were then placed into a stone, bedrock, or wooden 
mortar and pulverized into flour using a long pestle.  
Some tribes used a hopper mortar basket (a 
bottomless basket either glued with tar to the stone 
mortar or held down with the legs) to keep the 
pounded flour from bouncing up out of the mortar.  
Mason (1912) notes observations of remnant pitch or 
asphaltum circles surrounding mortar depressions 
within the Salinan area.   After pounding, acorn flour 
must be leached to remove the tannic acid.  There are 
various methods for completing this step, but they all 
include pouring water through the meal repeatedly 
until all traces of the bitter tannins are washed away.  
The Salinan placed the finely pounded flour into a 
specially made leaching basket.  The basket was 
woven closely enough to hold the meal but to allow 
the leaching water to percolate through (Mason 
1912). 
 
The majority of the California tribes, including the 
Costanoan, Yokuts and Luiseño peoples, leached 
acorn flour by using carefully constructed basins of 
clean sand near a stream or river.  The flour was 
leached many times by pouring the water over a 
bundle of leaves to keep the water from splashing 
sand into the meal.  Other tribes made leaching

Ethnobotanic:  Historically, acorns were the most 
important staple plant food for Native American 
groups in the coastal ranges of California.  Native 
Californians harvested, and still harvest today, 
several species of acorns including tanoak, coast live 
oak (Quercus agrifolia), canyon oak (Q. 
chrysolepsis), black oak (Q. kellogii), and valley oak 
(Q. lobata).  California tribes are estimated to have 
harvested from 500 to 2000 pounds of acorns per 
family per year (Hoover 1977).  A single tanoak tree 
can produce over 200 pounds of acorns in a good 
year and produces at least a partial crop every year 
(Baumhoff 1963). 
 
Tanoak acorns were the preferred acorns for the 
Salinan, Costanoan, Pomo, Yurok, Hoopa, and other 
groups residing within the trees range (Baumhoff 
1963. Merriam 1967. Heizer &amp. Elsasser 1980).   The 
ripe acorns are harvested in the fall.  They were 
spread out in the sun to dry and then stored in baskets 
or storage bins.   Many tribes constructed outdoor

frames from branches of incense cedar.  The cedar 
leaves kept the meal from washing away while 
imparting a spicy flavor to the meal (Murphey 1959).  
Another leaching method was to bury the whole 
acorns in the bed of a running stream and leaving 
them for as long as a year (Merriam 1967).  
 
The finely pulverized acorn meal was mixed with 
water and cooked in a special watertight cooking 
basket by placing hot, round stones that had been 
heated in the fire into the basket.  The acorn mixture 
was stirred constantly to keep the rocks rolling 
around and prevent them from burning the basket.  
The meal was cooked in this manner to make 
porridge and also a thick soup called atole.  The 
cooked mixture could be used to make pancakes and 
breads by pouring it onto a hot, flat rock that served 
as a griddle.   The Salinan baked acorn bread in an 
earth-oven and made acorn cakes about 8cm in 
diameter by wrapping them between two layers of 
grass and cooking them overnight (Mason 1912). The 
Pomo used to wrap loaves of acorn bread dough in 
leaves and place it in the coals of a fire to cook 
(Goodrich et al. 1990).  The Yurok made a dry form 
of acorn bread, baked on hot stones, which kept for a 
month or more (Merriam 1967). 
 
Tanbark acorns were also used for medicinal 
purposes such as treating coughs.  A single acorn was 
popped into the mouth and sucked on like a cough 
drop.  The tannins are said to help sooth the throat.  
Some California tribes made a type of penicillin from 
acorn meal (Murphey 1959).  Moist meal was 
wrapped and allowed to sit until it developed a moldy 
film.  Then the film was peeled off into a roll, which 
was stored in a damp place until needed.  Pieces of 
the mold were placed upon boils and other sores to 
draw out inflammation.  The Coastanoan made an 
infusion from the bark that they used as a medicinal 
wash for sores on the face and as a mouthwash to 
treat loosened teeth and toothaches (Bocek 1984).   
 
Whole tanbark acorns with their caps can be strung 
together to make a musical instrument that is played 
by twirling it in a special way.   
 
The Wintu made candy from the gum-like sap that 
they gathered in the fall (Dubois 1935).  The Wintu 
and other tribes used the soot from burnt oak galls to 
make tattoos (Knudtson 1988).   
 
Wildlife:  Tanoaks are important for cover and are 
used for resting, hiding, and nesting by many wildlife 
species (McMurray 1989).  The trees provide cover 
for northern flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus), 
dusky-footed woodrats (Neotoma fuscipes), arboreal 
 
 
salamanders (Aneides lugubris), and black 
salamanders (Aneides flavipunctatus).  House wrens 
(Troglodytes aedon), northern flickers (Colaptes 
auratus), downy woodpeckers (Picoides pubescens), 
red-breasted nuthatches (Sitta Canadensis), white-
breasted nuthatches (Sitta carolinensis), and brown 
creepers (Certhia Americana) nest in cavities in 
tanoak trees.   
 
Mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) graze on tanoak 
leaves and acorns.  Tanoak acorns are a source of 
food for black bears (Ursus americanus), chipmunks 
(Eutamias spp.), California ground squirrels 
(Spermophilus beechyi), Douglas squirrels 
(Tamiasciurus douglasi), pocket gophers (Thomomys 
bottae) and black-tailed deer (Odocileus hemionus).   
The acorns were once relished by grizzly bears 
(Ursus arctos), the state emblem of California, which 
have been extinct in this state since 1924 (Storer &amp. 
Usinger 1963).  Birds that rely on tanoak acorns as a 
source of food include the Steller’s jays (Cyannocita 
stelleri), band-tailed pigeons (Columba fasciata), 
varied thrushes (Ixoreus naevius) and acorn 
woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus).   
 
Livestock:  Ground acorns are sometimes added to 
chicken feed.  Tanoak is considered of low forage 
value for livestock because of its low palatability due 
to tannin content.   When cattle and other livestock 
consume tanoak, it is an indication of overgrazing, as 
the animals will generally only resort to this food 
source after higher quality forage has been consumed 
(McMurray 1989). 
 
Erosion control:  Tanoaks may be used for erosion 
control on sites that experience frequent disturbance.  
The trees help to stabilize soils as they have an 
extensive root system with a deep taproot and they 
quickly reestablish after disturbance through 
sprouting from a lignotuber, which is an underground 
regenerative organ  (McMurray 1989).   
 
Other:  Tanoak wood is of high quality, being of 
good strength and hardness with a fine grain, 
however the wood is not widely used because of 
limited supply.  Tanoak wood has been used for a 
variety of purposes including flooring, paneling, 
decking, plywood, garden tools, baseball bats, and 
firewood.  The bark has high tannin content and was 
once used extensively by industry in California for 
curing leather.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_='Description 
General:  Oak family (Fagaceae).  Tanoak is an 
evergreen hardwood tree or shrub native to the west 
coast ranges from Southern Oregon to Southern 
California.  The plants can reach 20 to 45 meters in 
height with the stems of large trees reaching up to 1 
meter in diameter.  The form and size of tanoak is 
variable depending on the environment.  Taller forms 
generally occur in shady forests and shorter forms in 
open areas where sunlight is more abundant.  
However, the trees can have a shrub-like form with 
multiple stems when access to light is prevented, 
such as when growing in a dense forest understory.  
Mature trees growing in a more open forest have a 
single, short trunk with horizontal branches.   
 
The thick, leathery evergreen leaves are oblong in 
shape with pointed tips (4 to 10 cm long).   The 
leaves have noticeable parallel side veins on the 
undersides that are evenly spaced and run from the 
central vein of the leaf ending in a pointy tooth at the 
leaf margin.  New leaves are covered with reddish-
brown hairs, which turns whitish as they mature.  
Older leaves are a smooth green on top with lightly 
pubescent gray-green below.  The evergreen leaves 
remain on the tree about 3 to 4 years before they are 
shed. The light reddish-brown bark develops deep 
fissures as the trees age.    Large clusters of tiny 
white flowers bloom in the summer months in the 
leaf axils of the current seasons growth.   The flowers 
are erect catkins and have an odor that is not pleasant.  
The acorns are from 2.5 to 5 cm long with a diameter 
of about 1.5 to 1.8 cm and grow singly or in cluster.   
Tanoak acorns have hairy, rather than scaly caps of 
the true oak.  Acorns ripen in the fall of the second 
season.   
 
Distribution:  Tanoak occurs on fertile mountain 
slopes and ridges below 1200 meters in the Coast 
Ranges from the Santa Inez Mountains in Southern 
California, to the Cascade Ranges in Southwestern 
Oregon.  For current distribution, please consult the 
Plant Profile page for this species on the PLANTS 
Web site. 
 
Habitat:  The tree form is a major part of the coastal 
redwood forest, Douglas fir forest, and mixed 
evergreen forest while the shrub form is a component 
of chaparral communities.

Tanoak can be easily propagated by seed.  Use only 
fresh seeds, as the seeds do not retain viablity.  The 
seeds of tanoak require no pretreatment and 
germinate quickly.  Tanoak acorns germinate faster if 
they are planted with their point facing upward in the 
soil (McMurray 1989).   The seeds may be directly 
sown into the ground or planted into flats or pots 
using a light soil mixture or peat moss.  If flats are 
used it is necessary to transfer the seeds into pots or 
the ground once they have germinated.   Pots should 
be of the kind that are long and deep to allow for the 
taproot to develop.  Set the seeds or seedlings into a 
carefully chosen spot keeping in mind that they can 
be long lived, with an average age of about 180 years 
and a maximum to 400 years.  Seedlings do best in a

and can be planted in five or six-inch pots, one-
quarter inch apart.  Place the seeds on top of the soil, 
sprinkle soil on top and put one-quarter inch gravel 
on top of the soil.  The seeds should be planted in 
well-drained soil and kept moist year round.  Let the 
rain water the pots in winter.  They should never be 
allowed to dry out.  If there is not sufficient rain, 
supplement with hand watering.  Put the pots outside 
in partial shade.  The seeds will sprout by about 
March.  After two years, separate the plants and 
space them four inches apart.  Fertilize the plants in a 
weak solution once a month during the active 
growing period.  Out-plant the plants after the third 
or fourth year in partial shade and keep them moist 
year round.  They should be planted two to four 
inches deep. 
 
If establishing the plants from bulbs, the secret to 
good survival is to get good live roots on the bulbs.

member of the Hamamelidaceae, or witch-hazel 
family.  It is named after the sweet balsamic sap 
which, when exposed, hardens into a fragrant gum.  
The trees can reach 30 to 40 meters in height and 
spread from 15 to 20 meters.  The mature bark is 
rough, deeply furrowed and grayish brown.  Young 
twigs are rusty red and frequently develop wings of 
corky bark.  The star-shaped leaves, somewhat 
resemble maple leaves, except that they are arranged 
alternately instead of opposite.  The leaves are 18 cm 
wide with long, thin petioles (6-15mm).  Actively 
growing leaves are fragrant when crushed.  They are 
palmate in shape with five to seven lobes and saw-
toothed margins.  Glossy-green in summer, the leaves 
turn bright yellow to deep red in the fall.  The 
undersides of the leaves are pale green with a coating 
of fine white hairs.  The small, greenish 
inconspicuous flowers have no true petals.  The 
woody, ball-shaped, pendulous, burr-like fruits (3-4 
cm) contain numerous, small seeds (1 cm) that are 
winged at one end.  The seeds are contained in beak-
like capsules to protrude from the surface (1 to 2 per 
capsule).   
 
Distribution: Sweetgum is common in the Coastal 
Plain and Piedmont sections of the Southeastern 
United States.  For current distribution, please consult

The hardened gum, or rosin from the tree was used as 
chewing gum.  A piece of the bark was knocked from 
the tree.  After one week, the sap from the wound 
was hardened and could be collected and used for 
chewing gum.  Tea was made from both the fruits 
and the bark.  The hardened sap was rolled up and 
then placed in a dog’s nose to treat distemper.  A 
salve was made by mixing the plant with animal 
tallow for application to wounds, cuts, sores, bruises, 
and ulcers.  The plant was boiled until a scum rose to 
the top.  This scum was then mixed with the roots of 
Obolaria virginica and used as a dressing for cuts 
and bruises.  The roots were boiled into a strong tea 
to treat skin sores that were possibly caused by small 
worms under the skin.  A “drawing plaster” was 
made from the gum.  Ten to a dozen drops of the sap 
were taken before meals to reduce fevers.  The sap 
and inner bark were used to treat diarrhea and 
dysentery.  The bark was used to make an infusion 
that was used as a sedative for nervous patients and 
for patients who were well in the day but sick during 
the night.  The plant was used to treat colic, internal 
diseases and to “comfort the heart.”

attractive specimen trees all year and especially in the 
fall when the leaves turn brilliant colors before 
dropping in the fall.  Young trees transplant best in 
the spring into well-watered soils.  The roots are slow 
to develop.  The trees may be planted in sun or part 
shade in soils that are medium to well drained and of 
medium to high fertility.  The trees need medium to 
high moisture availability and are not suitable for dry 
areas.  New trees volunteer readily from the seeds, 
however they generally do not germinate until the 
second year.  The seeds are ripe when the fruit begins 
to lose its green color.  Spread the fruits out to dry.  
When dry, they will open and release the seeds.  
Germination can be considerably increased if the 
seeds are prechilled for 15 to 90 days.

herbaceous perennial is 5 to 15 cm. tall with 
unbranched stems.  The alternate leaves are toothed 
and oblong to lance-shaped and pointed at both ends.  
The irregular, two-lipped flowers are tubular with the 
upper portion two-lobed and the lower spreading and 
divided into three parts.  The fire engine red flowers 
appear in long terminal racemes and they are from 
30-45 mm.  The anthers are at the end of a slender 
red filament tube extending out over the lower lip of 
the corolla.  The corolla has a slit on each side near 
the base.  The seeds come in a two-celled, many-
seeded capsules opening at the top.  They are small, 
less than 1 mm. and numerous.

Once, home, the bag is opened so that the capsules 
are exposed to the air for a few days.  Shake the bag 
to release the seeds.  Crushing the capsules with a 
rolling pin and picking out the seeds from the litter 
can retrieve the capsules that have remaining seeds.  
The seeds can then be planted right away. 
 
Propagation by seeds: The seeds will germinate 
without cold stratification, but they need light, so sow 
the seeds in a flat with a damp fine grade peat light 
mix.  Keep the flats moist and under lights or in a 
greenhouse.  They should green up in a few weeks.  
Transplant them in 4-6 weeks into individual pots

fertilize them every other week with a liquid 
fertilizer.  After another 4 weeks they can be put out 
in the garden or transplanted into larger pots of 4 to 6 
inch diameter.  Plant the plants in an outdoor spot 
that is in full sun or very light shade and never dries 
completely.  Space the plants 8 to 12 inches apart.  
Add plenty of peat moss when planting and mulch 
well to keep the soil cool and moist.  Protect the 
plants from deer.  Cardinal flower will take two years 
to bloom, forming a large rosette the first year.  
Allow the plants to self-sow.  They are heavy feeders, 
so compost or a shot of granular fertilizer when they 
begin growth is recommended. 
 
Propagation by cuttings: Take two node stem 
cuttings (4-6 inches) before the flowers open and 
remove the lower leaf and half the upper leaf.  Treat 
the cutting with hormodin 2 or roottone and place the 
cuttings in a sand and perlite medium, cover lightly, 
water, and remember to keep the medium moist.  
Roots will form in 2-3 weeks, but the cuttings need to 
force a good new crown from the lower node to 
successfully over-winter.

fertilize them every other week with a liquid 
fertilizer.  After another 4 weeks they can be put out 
in the garden or transplanted into larger pots of 4 to 6 
inch diameter.  Plant the plants in an outdoor spot 
that is in full sun or very light shade and never dries 
completely.  Space the plants 8 to 12 inches apart.  
Add plenty of peat moss when planting and mulch 
well to keep the soil cool and moist.  Protect the 
plants from deer.  Great blue lobelia will usually 
bloom in the first year.  Allow the plants to self-sow.

Propagation by cuttings: Take two node stem 
cuttings (4-6 inches) before the flowers open and 
remove the lower leaf and half the upper leaf.  Treat 
the cutting with hormodin 2 or root-tone and place 
the cuttings in a sand and perlite medium, cover

will form in 2-3 weeks, but the cuttings need to force 
a good new crown from the lower node to

them.  Plant the seeds into cells or flats in a 
greenhouse and cover them with a quarter inch of soil 
over the top.  Lupines succumb to root rot very easily 
in pots, so it is best to transplant them to the garden 
when they have two to three leaves.  Seeds can also 
be cleaned and stored dry at 40° F for several months 
and then planted directly in the garden in the 
following spring (after scarification).  Seed can be 
sown with a yard roller or by walking the site.  Plant 
in full sun with good air circulation, in loose, well-
drained soil.  The plants can tolerate poor, sandy, or 
gravely soil, preferably acid.  If no lupines have been 
present for many years on the site, wet the seeds and 
roll them in an inoculant for nitrogen-fixing bacteria 
before planting.  They should germinate in about one 
week.  The roots are strong and deep, making the

the plant.  The tarweeds produce abundant seed, are 
agreeably aromatic and oily, and form an important 
part of the small seeds used in pinole.  Tarweed and 
other seeds in pinole formed a staple food in the diet 
of the Indians of the Pacific Coast.  In particular, the 
seeds of gumweed (Madia elegans ssp. densifolia (E. 
Greene) Keck) were among the most valued by the 
Miwok people for pinole.  The Hupa, Cahuilla, 
Digueño, Chumash, Costanoan, Kawaiisu, and Maidu 
tribes in California made pinole from Madia species. 
 
Common madia seeds were harvested by women in 
late summer during a period of a fortnight.  A seed 
beater and a basket were used to gather the seeds.  
Then, the seeds were winnowed and ground very fine

CASSAVA 
                          Plant Guide

Cassava is one of the leading food and feed plants of 
the world.  It ranks fourth among staple crops, with a 
global production of about 160 million tons per year.  
Most of this is grown in three regions: West Africa 
and the adjoining Congo basin, tropical South 
America and south and Southeast Asia.  The young 
tender leaves are used as a potherb, containing high 
levels of protein and vitamins C and A.  The leaves 
are prepared in a similar manner as spinach, while 
eliminating toxic compounds during the cooking 
process.  
 
It is mainly used for human consumption, less for 
animal consumption and for industrial purposes, 
though this may vary by country.  The roots are 
rarely eaten fresh but are usually cooked, steamed, 
fried or roasted when fresh or after drying or 
fermenting.  It is advisable to peel, boil, grind or cut, 
and dry the roots in order to diminish the contents of 
cyanogenic glucosides.  All plant parts contain 
cyanogenic glucosides with the leaves having the 
highest concentrations. In the roots, the peel has a 
higher concentration than the interior.  In the past, 
cassava was categorized as either sweet or bitter, 
signifying the absence or presence of toxic levels of 
cyanogenic glucosides.  Sweet cultivars can produce 
as little as 20 mg of HCN per kg of fresh roots, while 
bitter ones may produce more than 50 times as much.  
The bitterness is identified through taste and smell.  
This is not a totally valid system, since sweetness is 
not absolutely correlated with HCN producing 
ability.  In cases of human malnutrition, where the 
diet lacks protein and iodine, under processed roots 
of high HCN cultivars may result in serious health 
problems. 
 
Cassava provides a major source of calories for poor 
families, because of its high starch content.  With 
minimum maintenance, the farmers can dig up the 
starchy root of the cassava and eat it 6 months to 3 
years after planting.  In Africa, people also eat the 
leaves of the cassava as a green vegetable, which 
provide a cheap and rich source of protein and 
vitamins A and B.  In Southeast Asia and Latin 
America, cassava has also taken on an economic role. 
Various industries use it as a binding agent, because 
it is an inexpensive source of starch.

the sweet variety are usually eaten cooked or baked. 
 
The juice can be concentrated and sweetened until it 
becomes a dark viscous syrup called kasripo 
(casareep).  This syrup has antiseptic properties and 
is used for flavoring. 
 
Livestock: Cassava leaves and stem meal are used for 
feeding dairy cattle.  Both fresh and dried cassava 
roots are consumed by ruminants in different forms 
(chopped, sliced, or ground).  Cassava bushes three to 
four months old are harvested as forage for cattle and 
other ruminants.   
 
Ornamental: One clone with variegated leaves is 
known to be planted as an ornamental. 
 
Commercial: Cassava starch is used in the production 
of paper, textiles, and as monosodium glutamate 
(MSG), an important flavoring agent in Asian 
cooking.  In Africa, cassava is used as partial 
substitution for wheat flour.  
 
Ethnobotanic: In Samoa, cassava was used to induce 
abortion.  The Amerindians use the brown juice, 
obtained during processing, for burns.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_='In general, the crop requires a warm humid climate.  
Temperature is important, as all growth stops at about 
10ºC.  Typically, the crop is grown in areas that are 
frost free the year round.  The highest root production 
can be expected in the tropical lowlands, below 150 
m altitude, where temperatures average 25-27°C, but 
some varieties grow at altitudes of up to 1 500 m. 
The plant produces best when rainfall is fairly 
abundant, but it can be grown where annual rainfall is 
as low as 500 mm or where it is as high as 5,000 mm.  
The plant can stand prolonged periods of drought in 
which most other food crops would perish.  This 
makes it valuable in regions where annual rainfall is 
low or where seasonal distribution is irregular.  In 
tropical climates the dry season has about the same 
effect on Cassava as low temperature has on 
deciduous perennials in other parts of the world.  The 
period of dormancy lasts two to three months and 
growth resumes when the rains begin again. 
 
Cassava is drought resistant and grows well in poor 
soil.  It is one of the most efficient producers of 
carbohydrates and energy among all the food crops. 
 
Distribution: Cassava can be found from the United 
States to Africa, Asia, Europe, and the South Pacific. 
For current distribution, please consult the Plant 
profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
site.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Cassava is a tropical root crop, requiring at least 8 
months of warm weather to produce a crop.  
However, under adverse conditions such as cool or 
dry weather it can take 18 or more months to produce 
a crop.  Cassava is traditionally grown in a savanna 
climate, but can be grown in extremes of rainfall. 
however, it does not tolerate flooding.  In droughty 
areas it looses its leaves to conserve moisture, 

Page 3
producing new leaves when rains resume.  Cassava 
does not tolerate freezing conditions, but does 
tolerate a wide range of soil pH 4.0 to 8.0 and is most 
productive in full sun.  
 
Propagation by seed: For agricultural purposes, 
cassava is propagated exclusively from cuttings 
because seed germination is usually less than 50 
percent.  Seedlings are raised from seed only for the 
purpose of selecting seedlings with fewer and smaller 
roots than those of the parents.  Botanically seeds are 
used only for breeding purposes. 
 
Propagation by cuttings: Propagate cassava by 
planting segments of the stem.  Cut stems into 9-30 
cm lengths. be sure to include at least one node.  
Segments can be buried vertically with 8-15 cm in 
the ground.  The selection of healthy, pest-free 
cuttings is essential.  Stem cuttings are sometimes 
referred to as  stakes .  In areas where freezing 
temperatures are possible, plant cuttings as soon as 
the danger of frost has past.  Cuttings can be planted 
by hand or by planting machines.  Hand planting is 
done in one of three ways: vertical, flat below the soil 
surface or tilted.  Under low rainfall conditions, 
vertical planting may result in the desiccation of the 
cuttings, while in areas of higher rainfall. flat-planted 
cuttings may rot.  In general, flat planting 5-10 cm 
below the soil surface is recommended in dry 
climates and when mechanical planting is used.  
Germination seems to be higher. tubers tend to 
originate from a great number of points and grow 
closer to the surface of the soil, making better use of 
fertilizers applied on the surface and also making 
harvesting easier.   
 
Vertical planting is used in rainy areas and tilted 
planting in semi-rainy areas.  Observing the polarity 
of the cutting is essential in successful establishment 
of the planting.  The top of the cutting must be placed 
upright.  Typical plant spacing is 1m by 1m.  
Cuttings produce roots within a few days and new 
shoots soon appear at old leaf petiole axes on the 
stem.  Early growth is relatively slow, thus weeds 
must be controlled during the first few months.  
Although cassava can produce a crop with minimal 
inputs, optimal yields are recorded from fields with 
average soil fertility levels for food crop production 
and regular moisture availability. 
 
Responses to macro-nutrients vary, with cassava 
responding most to P and K fertilization.  Vesicular-
arbuscular mycorrhizae benefit cassava by 
scavenging for phosphorus and supplying it to the 
roots.  High N fertilization, more than 100 kg of 
actual N/ha, may result in excessive foliage 
 
 
production at the expense of storage root 
development.  Fertilizer should only be applied 
during the first few months of growth.   
 
In moist soil, sprouting takes place within the first 
week after planting.  Within a month of the beginning 
of planting, the substitution of new cuttings to replace 
those that did not sprout is still possible.  Cassava is 
grown mainly as a cash crop and farmers may for ten 
years or more grow cassava on the same land.  
However, if the price of cassava roots drops, the 
farmers may shift to another crop (e.g., sugarcane, 
maize or sorghum) until cassava again becomes the 
more profitable crop. 
 
' WHERE symbol='maes';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management=' 
General: Cassava is either planted as a single crop or 
intercropped with maize, legumes, vegetables, 
rubber, oil palm or other economic important plants.  
Mixed planting reduces the danger of loss caused by 
unfavorable weather and pests by spreading the risk 
over plants with different susceptibilities. 
 
Cassava grows best on light sandy loams or on loamy 
sands which are moist, fertile and deep.  It grows 
well on soils ranging in texture from the sands to the 
clays and on soils of relatively low fertility.  Cassava 
can produce an economic crop on soils so depleted by 
repeated cultivation that they have become unsuitable 
for other crops.  On very rich soils the plant may 
produce stems and leaves at the expense of roots.  
Cassava will grow on a wide range of soils, provided 
the soil texture is friable enough to allow the 
development of the tubers. 
 
When cassava is grown as the first crop in forest land 
no further preparation is required than the clearing of 
the forest growth.  When cassava is grown after other 
crops it often can be planted without further 
preparation of the soil, once the preceding crop has 
been harvested or the soil has been plowed two or 
three times until free from grass and other plants. 
 
No fertilization is required when the land is freshly 
cleared or when there is enough land to enable 
growers to substitute new land for old when yields 
fall.  Like all rapidly growing plants yielding 
carbohydrates, cassava has high nutrient 
requirements and exhausts the soil very rapidly.  
When cassava is grown on the land for a number of 
years in succession or in rotation the soil nutrients are 
reduced and must therefore be returned to the soil by 
fertilization.  Large commercial farmers replace the 
nutrients lost by applying artificial fertilizers that are 
usually too costly for the small farmer.  Small 
farmers replace the nutrient loss by using different 

Page 4
kinds of organic manures, such as cattle or duck 
manure or garbage to replace the nutrients taken from 
the soil. 
 
Cassava is frequently cultivated as a temporary shade 
plant in young plantations of cocoa, coffee, rubber or 
oil palm.  When cultivated as a temporary shade 
plant, no special attention is given to the cassava 
plant.  When grown alone, the plants require little 
maintenance after planting.  Irrigation may be 
required if there is no rain, and hoeing of the earth 
helps preserve the subsoil humidity, especially in dry 
sandy soils.  The chief problem is weed control 
which may be desirable to weed the crop two or three 
times until the plants are well developed and their 
shade prevents the growth of weeds. 
 
Maturity differs from one variety to another, but for 
food the tubers can be harvested at almost any age 
below 12 months.  From the standpoint of maximum 
starch production, the optimum age for harvest is 18-
20 months.  During this growth period both root and 
starch production increase rapidly to their maximum 
value, after which root production decreases slowly 
and starch production much more rapidly on account 
of the declining starch content of the tubers. 
 
If the roots are left in the ground, starch content 
increases with age until, at a certain point. 
lignifications takes place, causing the roots to 
become tough and woody, so that they are harder to 
prepare for consumption and other uses. 
 
Harvesting of cassava can be done throughout the 
year when the roots reach maturity.  In regions with 
seasonal rains, harvesting is usually done in the dry 
season, during the dormant period of the plant. where 
rain prevails all year round, cassava is harvested 
throughout the year. 
 
There is no mature stage for cassava. because plants 
are ready for harvest as soon as there are storage 
roots large enough to meet the requirements of the 
consumer.  Under the most favorable conditions, 
yields of fresh roots can reach 90 t/ha while average 
world yields from mostly subsistence agricultural 
systems average 10 t/ha.  Typically harvesting can 
begin as soon as eight months after planting.  In the 
tropics, plants can remain un-harvested for more than 
one growing season, allowing the storage roots to 
enlarge further.  However, as the roots age and 
enlarge, the central portion becomes woody and 
inedible. 
 
Harvesting is still generally a manual operation, 
although equipment to facilitate this operation is 
 
 
being considered.  The day before harvest, the plants 
are &quot.topped&quot. the stalks are cut off 40-60 cm above 
ground by hand, machete or machine and piled at the 
side of the field.  This length of stalk is left as a 
handle for pulling.  Material required for the next 
planting is selected and the rest is burned.  In light 
soils the roots are slowly drawn from the soil simply 
by pulling the stems or with the help of a kind of 
crowbar and the tubers are cut off the stock.  In 
heavier soils a hoe may be required to dig up the 
roots before the plant is pulled out.  It must be noted 
that once the plants have been topped, lifting of the 
roots must not be delayed, as sprouting and a drastic 
fall in the starch content of the tubers will result. 
 
Once the roots are harvested, they begin to 
deteriorate within about 48 hours, initially owing to 
enzymatic changes in the roots and then to rot and 
decay.  The roots may be kept refrigerated for up to a 
week or stored in the ground for longer periods if 
they are not detached from the plant.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Mechanization TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Mechanization='In most of the tropical world cassava is grown on 
small plots. however, in some countries (e.g., 
Mexico, Brazil, and Nigeria) large plantations have 
been established.  The degree of mechanization 
depends on the amount of land, available labor in the 
area and general policy regarding the use of manual 
labor. 
 
The use of machinery for land preparation is 
preferable to manual labor to ensure the best possible 
seed bed for tuber development.  Subsequent 
operations of planting, weeding, topping and 
harvesting can be done by hand as well as by 
machinery. 
 
The following is an outline of the present use of 
machinery in cassava cultivation: 
-  The hoe remains the principal implement for 
- 
cultivating, weeding and harvesting. 
Plowing and harrowing, are usually done by 
tractor. 
-  A mechanical two row planter using a tractor 
driver and two men on the machine to feed 
cuttings from the reserve bins into the rotating 
planting turntable.  In operation, the cuttings fall 
in succession through a hole into a furrow 
opened by a simple furrower.  A pair of disks 
throws dirt into the furrow and floats pulled by 
chains pack the soil over the cuttings.  The 
planter is able to cover about 5 hectares per day. 
-  A gasoline-powered table saw is used to prepare 
the cuttings for planting.  The machine has the 

Page 5
advantage of speed and regularity of produced 
cuttings. 
-  A topping machine consisting of a heavy screen 
mounted on the front of a tractor has been 
developed to push down the tops: then a rotary 
mower on the back of the same tractor can cut 
the downed top to make harvesting by hand 
possible.  The height at which the tops are cut 
back can be easily regulated with any rotary 
mower. 
-  Cassava is not a crop that lends itself readily to 
mechanical harvesting because of the way the 
tubers grow.  They may spread over 1 m and 
penetrate 50 60 cm.  Careless use of machinery 
for harvesting can damage tubers, resulting in a 
darkening due to oxidation that will lower the 
value of the flour.  The mould-board plow has 
been used to make hand harvesting less tedious.  
Stalks can be cut successfully by a mid-mounted 
mower or a topping machine, and the roots are 
lifted mechanically with a mid-mounted disk 
terrace.

the most important and widest use of the fruit.  The 
fruit is a good source of vitamins A and C. 
Green mangoes are often cooked and eaten like 
vegetables or made into a delicious chutney or dried 
and ground into a powder called &quot.amchoor&quot. and used 
to impart a sour flavor to food.  
 
The kernels can be boiled and eaten with greens or 
ground and eaten roasted, dried, or pickled. but are 
generally eaten in times of famine or by the poorest.  
 
Livestock Food: Mango leaves are occasionally fed to 
cattle, but large quantities can cause death. 
The fruits are relished by both cattle and pigs. 
however, the kernels are fairly rich in tannins, which 
progressively lead to reduced growth rates and less 
efficient feed utilization when included as a major 
component in diets for pigs and poultry. 
 
Mangoes that are not fully mature are sliced and 
ensiled in pits 1.5 m3 dug in the ground and lined 
with large leaves.  One percent salt should be added.  
The pits are tightly covered with leaves and soil.  
This silage can be used for off-season pig feeding. 
 
Ethnobotanic: Dried mango flowers, containing 15% 
tannin, serve as astringents in cases of diarrhea, 
chronic dysentery, catarrh of the bladder and chronic 
urethritis.  The bark was used against rheumatism and 
diphtheria.  The resinous gum from the trunk was 
applied to cracks in the skin of the feet and on 
scabies.  Mango kernel decoction and powder were 
used as vermifuges and as astringents in treatment for 
diarrhea, hemorrhages and bleeding hemorrhoids.  
Leaf decoction was taken as a remedy for fever, chest 
pains, diarrhea, diabetes, and hypertension.  Extracts 
of bark, leaves, stems, and unripe fruits were used as 
antibiotics for many ills.   
 
When mango trees are in bloom, it is not uncommon 
for people to suffer itching around the eyes, facial 
swelling and respiratory difficulty, even though there 
is no airborne pollen.  The few pollen grains are large 
and they tend to adhere to each other even in dry 
weather.  The stigma is small and not designed to 
catch windborne pollen.  The irritant is probably the 
vaporized essential oil of the flowers which contains 
the sesquiterpene alcohol, mangiferol, and the ketone, 
mangiferone. 
 
The twigs and leaves, used to clean the teeth, are said 
to be beneficial to the gums, while the bark is said to

be useful for toothaches.  The astringent stomachic 
bark is also used for internal hemorrhages, bronchitis, 
and catarrh.  The resin is used for cracked feet, 
ringworm, and other fungi, syphilis, and to induce 
sweating.  Smoke from the burning leaves is believed 
to cure various throat disorders, from asthma to 
hiccups.  Dried mango flowers, containing 15% 
tannin, serve as astringents in cases of diarrhea, 
chronic dysentery, catarrh of the bladder and chronic 
urethritis resulting from gonorrhea.  
 
Green fruits are considered anticholeric (baked and 
mixed with sugar and taken internally and also 
rubbed over the body), antidysmenorrheic, 
antiscorbutic, astringent, and diaphoretic.  Roasted 
green fruits are dissolved in sugar water and taken 
internally to prevent sunstroke.  Ripe fruits are 
considered diuretic, laxative, and unguent.  A gruel 
made of the seeds is taken internally for bleeding 
piles.  The wood is favored for making shovels. 
  
The bark contains mangiferine and is astringent and 
employed against rheumatism and diphtheria in India. 
The resinous gum from the trunk is applied on cracks 
in the skin of the feet and on scabies, and is believed 
helpful in cases of syphilis.  
 
Mango kernel decoction and powder (not tannin-free) 
are used as vermifuges and as astringents in diarrhea, 
hemorrhages and bleeding hemorrhoids.  The fat is 
administered in cases of stomatitis.  Extracts of 
unripe fruits and of bark, stems and leaves have 
shown antibiotic activity.  In some of the islands of 
the Caribbean, the leaf decoction is taken as a remedy 
for diarrhea, fever, chest complaints, diabetes, 
hypertension and other ills.  A combined decoction of 
mango and other leaves is taken after childbirth. 
 
Seed fat: Having high stearic acid content, the fat is 
desirable for soap-making.  The seed residue after fat 
extraction is usable for cattle feed and soil 
enrichment.  
 
Bark: The bark possesses 16% to 20% tannin and has 
been employed for tanning hides.  It yields a yellow 
dye, or, with turmeric and lime, a bright rose-pink.  
 
Wood: Kiln-dried and preservative treatment wood is 
used to make window frames, rafters, joists, 
plywood, shoe heels, boxes, boats, and canoes. 
 
Wildlife: Mango fruit and leaves are eaten by deer.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Description='General: The cashew family (Anacardiaceae), of 
which mango is a member, includes a number of 
species which can cause severe skin irritation in 
humans.  Poison ivy (Rhus toxicodendron), found in 
North America, is one particularly notable example.  
For most people, mango has no such effect, but in 
sensitive individuals ingestion of the fruit, or skin 
contact with its juice, may cause a poison ivy-like 
rash. 
 
Mango is a large evergreen tree that can reach 15 to 
30 m tall.  They are fast growing erect trees with 
slender to broad and rounded upright canopy that can 
be used for landscape and shade.  The trees are long -
lived with some still producing fruit at 300 years old.  
The tree is anchored by a long unbranched taproot 
can descend to a depth of 6-8 m plus a mass of feeder 
roots.  The feeder roots send down anchor roots 
which penetrate the soil to a depth of 1.2 m and 
spread lateral as far as 7.5 m. 
 
The leaves are alternate, simple, leathery, oblong-
lanceolate, 29-30 cm long X 3-5 cm wide on 
flowering branches, up to 50 cm on sterile branches. 
The young leaves are red, aging to shiny dark green 
above, lighter below, with yellow or white venation.  
 
The inflorescence is a much-branched panicle 
bearing many very small (4 mm) greenish white or 
pinkish flowers. Both male and bisexual flowers are 
borne on the same tree. The flowers are radially 
symmetrical, and usually have 5 petals, streaked with 
red. There is usually only 1 fertile stamen per flower. 
the 4 other stamens are sterile. The flower has a 
conspicuous 5-lobed disk between the petals and 
stamens.  
 
The fruit is an irregularly egg-shaped and slightly 
compressed fleshy drupe, 8-12 (-30) cm long, 
attached at the broadest end on a pendulous stalk. 
The skin is smooth greenish-yellow, sometimes 
tinged with red.  The underlying yellow-orange flesh 
varies in quality from soft, sweet, juicy and fiber-free 
in high-quality selected (clonal) varieties to 
turpentine-flavored and fibrous in unselected (wild) 
seedlings.  The single, compressed-ovoid seed is 
encased in the white fibrous inner layer of the fruit. 
 
Mangoes can be round, oval, heart-shaped, or kidney-
shaped. and can weigh as little as a few ounces or as 
much as five pounds.  Their highly aromatic flesh 
surrounds a very large inedible flat seed.  At its best, 

Page 3
it has a pleasant resinous quality, but at its worst can 
smell like kerosene.  The soft pulp is juicy and sweet, 
although it can sometimes has an acid overtone. 
Some mangoes have fibrous flesh, while others are 
buttery all the way through. 
 
The round or oval fruit is somewhat flattened and can 
weigh up to 0.5 kg. The flesh of good fruit has a 
pleasant aromatic flavor, but inferior varieties have a 
turpentine flavor and can be rather fibrous.  In the 
centre is the large fibrous flat seed containing a 
kernel.  
 
Distribution and Habitat: The mango is native to 
southern Asia, especially Burma and eastern India. It 
spread early on to Malaya, eastern Asia and eastern 
Africa. 
 
Mangoes are grown throughout the tropics, from the 
Caribbean to Africa, South-East Asia, Australia, as 
well as India, where the history of the fruit goes back 
over 6,000 years and closely connected to the Hindu 
religion.  As long ago as the 16th century, mangoes 
had been distributed via cultivation throughout the 
Indian subcontinent, and eventually to all tropical 
regions of the world.   
 
It performs best at elevations from 0-1200 m. with a 
pronounced rainy season for vegetative growth, a dry 
season for flowering and fruiting, and on well-
drained soils ranging in pH between 5.5 to 7.5.  It 
was not until the 19th century that traders introduced 
the fruit to the West Indies, Africa, South America, 
Mexico, Florida, and Hawaii.  Mangoes were 
introduced to California (Santa Barbara) in 1880.

In deep sandy type soil the tap root will decend to 20 
feet with the feeder roots growing in descending 
order.  The mango requires full sun and perfect air 
drainage in winter.   
 
Mangos will grow in almost any well-drained sandy, 
loam or clay soil but does not grow well in heavy wet 
soils.  Soil ph must be between 5.5 and 7.5.  They are 
somewhat tolerant of alkalinity.  Plantings 
 
 
established during the dry season will require rainfall 
or irrigation everyday.  The amount of irrigation 
required will depend on soil type, amount of rainfall, 
and temperature.  Light sandy soils will require 
almost continues watering until the fruit is harvested.  
Irrigation should be discontinued when rainfall is 
sufficient enough to keep the soil moist.  Young 
seedlings require applications of nitrogen fertilizer to 
promote healthy growth and flower production.  
However, care must be taken not to create fertilizer 
burn.   
 
Propagation by seed: Remove the husk and plant the 
seed with the hump at soil level.  Seed will normally 
germinate in two to four weeks.  Seedlings developed 
from seed will bloom and bear in three to six years. 
 
Propagation by grafting: Small plants with a 
diameter about the size of a pencil graft well with the 
common whip graft.  Crown groove graft allows 
several scions to be put on at once.  Fully grown trees 
may be top-worked by crown groove bark graft or 
prune hard and whip graft sprouts later.  Plastic 
bagging with a few drops of moisture will improve 
the graft’s chances of being successful.  Grafts are 
most successful if the leaves are allowed to remain 
below the graft, but removed suckers.  When top 
working, do not dehorn the entire tree, leave several 
braches fully leafed.

Extensive information on the management of mango 
in Hawaii and the Pacific Basin Islands can be found 
in Bally (2006).  This document is available on the 
Web at &lt.www.traditionaltree.org&gt..  
 
Mango trees managed for commercial fruit 
production should be irrigated once weekly in coastal 
areas and almost continuously in dry areas until the 
fruit is harvested.  After harvest, irrigation should be 
reduced to a level that prevents wilt.  This process 
should continue for about two months before 
increasing irrigation to initiate new bloom and 
growth cycle.  While irrigation is important for tree 
establishment and survival, it must be part of an 
overall management plan that includes fertilization.  
These trees require a feeding program similar to the 
one used for citrus.  This feeding program must 
include nitrogen and the micronutrient especially 
iron. 
 
Once plantings are established pruning can be used to 
stimulate new growth, provide for uniform annual 
fruit bearing, and control size.  Pruning should be 
preformed in late winter and early spring to avoid 
loss of fruit.  When pruning or removing litter avoid

getting the sap on unprotected skin, because the sap 
can cause severe dermatitis.  Pruned material and 
other mango litter should not be burned to avoid 
breathing affected air.

were burned for plant improvement by the tribes 
throughout California. 
•  Seeds were planted from wild plants.  A 
Diegueño woman reported her people always 
cleared a small spot near their dwelling to plant 
seeds of plants with greens, seeds, and roots. 
species produce prolific seeds, and can be planted 
directly in the soil or in seed flats.  Plant seeds at the 
soil surface or plant 1/8&quot. to ¼&quot. in a well-drained soil.  
As the soil dries, water seedlings stimulate growth.  It 
is best to plant seeds in the fall.  Fertilization 
stimulates growth and seed production.  Seeds 
germinate rapidly.  Plant the seedlings into 2” or 4” 
pots after they grow 2-4 leaves beyond thee 
cotyledons.  Water as needed, but do not overwater.

when the seed is ripe and the plants have begun to die

elevation.  If the plants are still green, it is too early

seedbeater and the seeds dropped into a seed-
gathering basket.  Today the plant is tapped with a 
flat stick and the seeds drop into a pan or on a cloth 
that is laid under the plant.  The plant can also be 
uprooted and shaken and beaten onto a canvas tarp.  
The seeds are winnowed to remove the chaff.  A 
gentle breeze makes a good seed cleaning wind. 
 
Today the seeds are placed into a frying pan and 
lightly roasted on the stove, emitting an aroma not

gray or light brown on the surface and dark red-
brown internally (Sargent 1961). 
 
Distribution: Pacific waxmyrtle occurs in canyons 
and hill slopes of the coastal region from the Santa 
Monica Mountains of Los Angeles County northward

Agroforestry: Myrica californica is used in tree strips 
for windbreaks.  They are planted and managed to 
protect livestock, enhance production, and control 
soil erosion.  Windbreaks can help communities with 
harsh winter conditions better handle the impact of 
winter storms and reduce home heating costs during 
the winter months.  They also provide shade and 
wind protection during the summer, which aids in the 
reduction of cooling bills.

used this plant in combination with other plants to 
relieve colds.  The Hocak (Winnebago) used wild 
bergamot in their sweat bath and inhaled the fumes to 
cure colds.  A decoction of boiled leaves was used as 
a cure for eruptions on the face.  The Cherokee made 
a warm poultice of the plant to relieve a headache.  
The Teton Dakota boiled together the leaves and 
flowers as a cure for abdominal pains.  The Blackfoot 
made a tea from the blossoms and leaves to cure 
stomach pains.  They also applied boiled leaves to the 
pustules of acne.  The Tewa dried the plant and 
ground it into a powder that was rubbed over the 
head to cure headaches, over the body to cure fever, 
and as a remedy for sore eyes and colds.  Early white 
settlers used it as a diaphoretic and carminative, and 
occasionally employed it for the relief of flatulent 
colic, nausea and vomiting.   
 
Economic: Wild bergamot is used in flower 
arrangements.  Bees, butterflies and hummingbirds 
use the plant for nectar.

under 40 degrees F for three months.  
 
Propagation by seeds: Sow seeds in flats during 
January and stored in a greenhouse are expected to 
germinate in one to two weeks.  The soil mix can be 
one-third sand and two-thirds commercial plug mix.  
Apply a starter fertilizer solution for the seedlings.  
Water flats when the soil surface is dry to the touch.  
Keep the seedlings in the flats for 6-7 weeks, and 
then transplant them to 3-inch pots.  Continue to 
water seedlings when the surface is dry to the touch.  
Pinch off the tops of the plants several times during 
the growing season to encourage branching and 
bushier grow habit.  Apply a weekly application of an 
all-purpose fertilizer for the transplants.  When the 
roots fill the container (about 2 months) they are 
ready for outplanting in the garden.   
 
Plant seedlings in a sunny, weed-free well-drained 
soil, one and one-half to two feet apart.  Water, until 
rains come. 
 
Seeds can also be broadcast on a weed-free surface 
from January to mid-May in sunny locations.  Once 
the seeds germinate seedlings should be watered 
during extended dry period.  During the first summer 
of full growth mow the area 3 to 5 times to keep the 
plants between 8 and 4 inches tall.  Mowing also 
reduces weeds. 
 
Propagation by cuttings: Take stem tip cuttings, 3-4 
inches long, any time from May to August.  Remove 
the lower leaves and all flower or seed heads and 
insert the stems into a sand and perlite-rooting 
medium.  Bury each cutting up to the first node.  
Place the cuttings in an enclosed area and mist them 
several times a day.  In 4 to 5 weeks the cuttings 
should be well rooted and can be transplanted to pots.  
Then outplant the plants in the garden in the early 
autumn.

other birds as well.  In sunny openings where 
deergrass occurs, it forms a larval food plant for one 
of the Satyrid butterflies, the California ringlet 
(Coenonympha california) and for the umber skipper 
(Poanes melane).  Massive numbers of ladybugs 
overwinter in deergrass clumps. 
 
Conservation: Deergrass is a valuable streambank 
stabilizer, as it has an extensive root system, and if 
grown in dense enough colonies, it can be an 
effective weed suppresser.  In California, Pacific Gas 
and Electric is experimenting with growing dense 
colonies under powerline corridors.  It s long, slender 
culms, and tall tufts making it an attractive plant for 
the garden.  
 
Other Uses: Uses of deergrass include streambank 
stabilization, landscaping, forage, insectary, weed 
suppressant, and wildlife.

length and less than 1.2 cm. wide.  The numerous, 
small spikelets each have one awnless floret, with a 
3-nerved lemma. The ligules are firm and truncate, 2-
3 mm long.  The leaves are 1.5 to 6 mm wide.  The 
seeds are small, requiring about 2.5 million to make

Ethnobotanic: Deergrass is a significant basketry 
material to central and southern California Native 
Americans who utilize the flower stalks in the 
foundations of coiled baskets.  Frequently thousands 
of flower stalks are needed for completion of each 
basket.  Culms are gathered in late spring while still 
green, or summer or early fall when golden brown 
depending upon the tribe, individual family 
preference and elevation of the deergrass site. 
 
Wildlife: In California, dense patches of deergrass 
provide cover during the fawning period of mule deer 
(Odocoileus hemionus) in mountain meadows and 
grassland openings.  The younger palatable tufts are 
grazed by deer, horses, and cattle and can remain 
palatable if continually grazed.  It is particularly 
sought for forage by animals when first resprouting 
after a burn.  Older tufts are poor feed for livestock.  
The seeds provide food for songbirds and probably

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Adaptation: Deergrass can withstand periodic 
flooding, but it cannot tolerate poorly-drained soils.  
The major plant communities it inhabits include 
valley grassland, streamsides, and meadow habitat.  
Additionally, deergrass is shade-intolerant and also 
occurs in grassland openings within chaparral, mixed 
conifer forests, and oak woodland plant communities, 
maintained with human-set or lightning fires. On 
most soil types, these grassland areas quickly revert 
to the surrounding dominant vegetation type without 
human or natural disturbance. 
 
Broadcast Seeding: In California and the Southwest, 
deergrass can be broadcast seeded in the late spring 
or summer during the months of May, June, July, and 
August, with irrigation. The seeds are tiny and should 
be broadcast on top of the ground, and then run over 
with a ring roller or a culti-packer to compress the 
seeds slightly below the soil surface.  For best results, 
sow at least four pounds of PLS (pure live seed) per 
acre, which amounts to 50 seeds per square foot.  
Deergrass is slow growing and germination rates can 
vary from two weeks up to two months.  Fertilization 
of deergrass is not recommended, as it usually gives 
the alien weeds a competitive edge.  Site preparation 
is extremely important for good establishment of 
deergrass.  Both repetitive tillage and burning are 
recommended to drastically curtail weed competition.  
Repetitive tillage involves loosening the soil, 
irrigating, and cultivating the area with a disc harrow, 
following with a ring roller to kill the flush of annual 
weeds.  This is done several times prior to seeding to 
exhaust the weed seed bank.  Burning involves firing 
all residual dry matter prior to seeding.  
 
Container Planting: Container planting is a more 
effective and less time consuming way of 
establishing deergrass, but it is more costly than 
seeding on a large scale.  Deergrass seed can be sown 
into flats or, D-pots, stubby cells, or reforestation 
tubes in May.  Plants can be planted out from 
containers in the fall of the same year in soil that has 
been moistened with the first rains, using standard 
planting procedures.  Plants can also be sown in the 
fall in flats or containers and planted out the next 
summer or fall in the designated area.  Plants should 
be spaced at a minimum width of 24 inches.  
Irrigating is not necessary if it is a normal rainfall 
year.  Site preparation is the same as for a broadcast 
seeding.  Larger bunchgrasses can also be divided in 
winter or early spring and transplanted.  A good stand 
of deergrass can be established by container planting 
 
 
in one and one half years.  It is thought that container 
planting with grown plugs is more effective than a 
seeding. 
 
' WHERE symbol='muri2';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='Once established, deergrass is quite drought-tolerant.  
To maintain its vigor and reduce accumulated dead 
material, deergrass can be mowed or burned every 
several years.  Burning or mowing should be in the 
fall, after it has gone to seed.  Many tribes 
historically and probably prehistorically enhanced 
deergrass populations through firing deergrass stands 
in the fall in California every two to five years.  
Indian-set fires increased flower stalk yields, recycled 
nutrients, cleared away detritus, and promoted 
seedling production in the midst of reduced 
competition from other plants.  According to Native 
American elders, these fires maintained the 
bunchgrass in greater numbers than would have 
occurred under natural conditions.   Knowledge of 
past indigenous fire management of deergrass has 
important implications for mountain meadow habitat 
management for wildlife and maintenance of 
grassland openings within shrublands, woodlands, 
and forests for preservation of indigenous cultural 
traditions.  Some areas could be managed with the 
dual objectives of indigenous harvesting of flower 
stalks and grazing after culm harvest.  There are 
several fungi that infect the leaves of deergrass, 
causing debilitation, but usually not death.  A fire 
would eliminate these pathogens.

If possible, gather the seed from local sources, to 
maintain genetic diversity of deergrass.  The flower 
stalks can be cut, bundled, and then beat over a tarp 
or bucket to release the seeds.  The seeds are usually 
highly viable, and do not need special treatment.

General: Establish the plant by seed.  Plant the seeds 
in a flat in a nursery at a depth that is the width of the 
seeds.  The seeds should be planted in the spring in 
well-drained soil with a coarse layer of sand on top 
and gently watered.  Protect the flat from animals.  
Let the surface of the soil dry out between watering.  
If the flats are watered too often, this can cause the 
plants to rot.  A good indicator of over-watering is 
that the plants wilt.  Once the seedlings have leaves 
and are at least two inches tall with sturdiness to 
them, transplant them into individual pots with good 
drainage holes.  After transplanting, put the 
containers in a shady area that is protected from wind 
and animals such as a lath house or a shady grove of 
trees.

After one and one-half years, plant the plants 
outdoors in lower elevations in mid-to-late fall or 
early winter.  In higher elevations where the ground 
freezes, it is best to plant the plants when the ground 
thaws.  After planting, water the plants and let them 
dry out on the surface between watering.  During the 
rainy season, supplement with hand watering if the 
rains are insufficient.  Plant the plants in a well-
drained, well-aerated soil.  Plant in partial shade, 
using a shade cloth or other means until well-
established and then remove the shade cloth to 
expose the plant to full sun.  Water the plant through 
the summer.  It will be necessary to water the plant 
for several years until well established.  In areas

and boils.  A poultice made from the entire plant was 
used to treat bruises.  The roots were chewed and 
rubbed onto the muscles to improve strength.  The

menstruation as well as bowel pain.  Handfuls of 
people still use the plant today, medicinally and for 
food.   
  
Other: Common evening-primrose is commercially 
cultivated in over 15 countries for its oil which 
contains the essential fatty acids, linoleic acid and 
gamma linolenic acid (Kemper 1999).  When the 
seedpods ripen, the tall stalks can be cut and used as 
interesting additions to dried arrangements. 
 
Wildlife: Hummingbirds visit the flowers to obtain 
nectar and insects to eat.  The seed capsules provide 
food for many other birds during the winter months.  
It is thought that the plants are pollinated by night-
visiting hawk moths, which feed on their nectar.  
Japanese Beetles prefer the leaves of common 
evening-primrose to those of other garden plants.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_='General: Cactus Family (Cactaceae).  The buckhorn 
cholla is an open and spreading woody cactus, up to 1 
m tall.  The gray-green stems, also called &quot.joints&quot., are 
cylindrical, 5-30 cm long and 17-20 mm in diameter 
with tubercles or nodules.  Each tubercle has a cluster 
of stiff spines, which are covered with loose papery 
sheaths.  The flowers are up to 5 cm long and range 
from yellow to purple-red with shades in between.  
The fruits are obovoid, dry, shriveled and spiny and 
drop off later in the season.  The seeds are light 
yellowish to gray-brown, 3.5 to 4 mm. long.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Seeds: To establish Opuntia spp. by seed is a slow 
process.  It takes up to five years, compared to six 
months by a stem, and is therefore not recommended. 
 
Cuttings: Break off or cut the stem of the cactus in 
the spring.  Choose a smaller cylindrical stem with 
one joint and take the newest growth, when possible, 
a complete branch should be taken as the cutting.  
Ideally, the cut should be made at the neck where the 
branch joins the stem.  Place the cutting in an area 
with good air circulation, in partial shade for several 
days or until the cut surface has formed a callus.  The 
cutting is then planted with its cut surface 3 mm 
below the surface in compost that contains little 
nutrients and placed in partial shade.  Keep the plant 
slightly moist until roots are established.  Once roots 
are formed the plant can be potted in a well-drained, 
sandy soil.  Plant the cactus in a permanent place 
with full sun outdoors in the fall.  Make sure the soil 
has excellent drainage.  This cactus is intolerant of 
frequent summer water and should not be planted

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Uses='Ethnobotanic: In the Southwest the Hualapai and 
Pima harvested the unopened flower buds of 
buckhorn cholla with two long sticks.  The sticks 
were used to grab the mature buds and twist them off 
into a large flat basket or bucket.  The spines are then 
removed prior to cooking.  Traditionally the buds 
were baked in an earthen pit, lined with stones, and 
heated with mesquite (Prosopis velutina) firewood.  
Then the buds were eaten right away or dried and 
stored for future use.  Pima individuals who had 
stomach troubles were put on a special diet of these 
buds made into gruel.  Some individuals still gather 
buckhorn cholla today. 
 
Wildlife: Many kinds of Opuntia species have fruits, 
seeds, and stems that are eaten by wildlife.  Small 
mammals that feed on seeds and fruits include 
Western chipmunks, pocket gophers, brown gophers, 
Harris ground squirrels, prairie dogs, kangaroo rats, 
skunks, and cottontail and jackrabbits.  Hoofed 
browsers feed on the vegetable parts and fruits such 
as antelope, white tailed deer, and mountain sheep.

General: Sunflower Family (Asteraceae).  Wild 
quinine is a perennial, herbaceous forb.  Stiff, 
upright, sometimes hairy stems are single, or 
branched near the top.  Stems (4-12 dm in height) 
grow from a swollen tuberous root.  The leaves are 
ovate to lanceolate with wavy, toothed margins.  
Basal leaves are 38 cm long.  Stem leaves are 
alternate, smaller, and sparsely distributed along the 
stems.  The long-lasting, somewhat-yarrow-like 
flower heads are composed of grayish-white, 
globular, compound flowers that are 4-6 mm wide.  
Five, unusually short, ray flowers (1-2mm long) 
surround the central disk flower corollas, which are 
2.5-3 mm long.  Only the ray flowers are fertile.  The 
heads are grouped together into an inflorescent spray 
up to 20 cm in diameter.  Flowers have a pleasant but 
mild medicinal fragrance.  The plant flowers from 
summer through the autumn months. 
 
Distribution: For current distribution, please consult 
the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site. 
 
Habitat:  Wild quinine occurs in dry, somewhat 
heavy soils in prairies, fields, open wooded areas, 
rocky woods, and hillsides.

Wild quinine is a very hardy addition to the garden as 
it is tolerant of both hot and cold weather.  The plants 
make a nice addition to native plant gardens because 
of their wild growth form.  Wild quinine plants are 
easily propagated by seed.  Plant seeds in the fall or 
early winter or pre-treat them with 4 to 6 weeks of 
cold moist stratification to improve germination.  
Wild quinine will grow best in fertile, well-drained

Purple passionflower is a native, perennial vine.  The 
slightly pubescent vines climb with tendrils that arise 
from the axils of the leaves.  The vines can range 
from 2 to 6 m long.  The alternate leaves (6 to 15 cm 
long and wide) are palmate with 3 lobes and finely 
serrated margins.  The spectacular flowers are pale-
lavender or, rarely, white, with five petals (3 to 4 cm 
long, 4 to 7 mm wide) and five sepals (2.5 to 3.5 cm 
long).  The complex flower has a “crown” or corona 
of numerous fringelike segments that arise from 
above the petals.  The corona is white or lavender 
with purple bands.  The reproductive parts are 
interestingly arranged and add to the exotic beauty of 
the flower.  The unique appearance of the flowers 
was purported, by early Spanish explorers, to 
represent the sufferings of Christ (for a detailed 
description see Coffey 1993).  The plants bloom from 
June to September.  Sweet-smelling, yellowish fruits 
develop in two to three months after flowering and 
may be harvested from July to October.  The pulpy 
fruit, or “maypop”, is large and oval, about the size of 
a hen’s egg (4 to 10 cm long).  The fruit contains 
many flattened, dark-colored seeds (4 to 6 mm long) 
that are covered with an arillate pulp, which is the 
edible portion of the fruit.

juice.  Sometimes the juice was thickened by mixing 
it with flour or cornmeal.  The young shoots and 
leaves were eaten, cooked with other greens.  The 
roots were used in an infusion to treat boils, and to 
“draw out inflammation” of wounds from briers or 
locusts.  Babies were given a tea made from the roots 
to aid in weaning.  The roots were beaten with warm

traces of white.  Wash the gelatinous covering from 
the seeds if they are to be stored for any length of 
time.  It is best to plant the seeds directly into an 
outdoor seedbed.  The seedlings may be transplanted 
after they have three or four leaves or, once 
established, they can be used to provide cuttings or 
divisions.  Cuttings should be taken in the early 
spring.  Remove the lower leaves from a 15 to 20 cm 
cutting before placing it in the rooting medium.

harvest the roots among the Ojibwe.  “They only 
gathered the root when the red berries were mature, 
but before they were ready to drop.  Into the hole 
from whence the root came, they would thrust the 
whole fruiting top, and carefully firm the soil upon it.  
Knowing the location well, they would revisit the 
place in three to five years and find more roots than 
they harvested in the first instance.”  The roots were 
used in eyewash by the Iroquois to treat the sore eyes 
of two-year-old children.  The root could also be 
steeped in warm water and drunk for alleviating sores 
on the body.  The pulverized root was smoked to treat 
asthma.  Women of the Penobscot tribe took an 
infusion of the root to increase fertility.  The 
Delaware used the roots and other plant parts as a 
general tonic.  American ginseng is in high demand 
in the United States and China as an herbal remedy.  
It is used for stress and to increase energy and mental 
acuity in the United States.  In China, it is a panacea 
for sexual impotency, nervousness, vomiting, and 
dyspepsia.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Ginseng is widely cultivated in the U.S., Canada, and 
China.  In natural conditions, the seed may take two 
or three years to germinate and the plant three to four 
years to produce seed.  The root takes at least three to 
four years before it is ready to harvest (Sadler 1999).  
Detailed growing instructions are available from 
Michigan State University Extension (1996). 
 
Propagation by seeds: Fruits should be collected 
when they are red, usually August or September.  
Seeds can be separated from the pulp and sown fresh 
in the fall in flats.  If stored, they should be stored 
moist.  If buying seed, soak it in a 10 percent bleach 
solution for 20 minutes and rinse before sowing to 
kill any fungus spores that may have come along with 
them.  After a 3-fingered leaf emerges in the spring, 
transplant each of these in bunches of 3 to deep pots.  
They will be ready to plant outside the following fall.  
Plant the plants in full shade under deciduous trees in 
a well-drained soil and keep them moist.  Wild 
American ginseng is typically found in calcium rich 
forest soils well supplied with organic matter.

Pinyon ranks first among the native nut trees that are

eaten after roasting in the shell, but small quantities 
are sold raw.  They were once a staple food of 
Southwestern Indians.  Local residents now harvest

quantities for the local and gourmet market, but they 
are in competition with many wild animals that also 
seek the nuts as food.   
 
Pinyon nuts are a preferred food for turkeys, pinyon 
jays, woodrats, bears, and other wildlife, and they are 
a common food for deer, particularly during harsh 
winters with deep snows.  Pinyon-juniper woodlands 
provide habitat for a varied wildlife population, 
including mule deer, white-tailed deer, elk, desert 
cottontail, mountain cottontail, and wild turkey.   
 
Poor growth form and small size of two-needle 
pinyon has limited its use for sawn products.  
Specialized woodworking shops use the wood for 
novelties, and small sawmills produce mine timbers 
and railroad ties.  Two-needle pinyon has been used 
for pulping in the Southwest, but only to alleviate 
shortages of normally used mill-residue chips and 
pulpwood of other species.  It has been widely used 
for fuel since the pitchy wood has a higher heat value 
than any of its associates except the oaks and burns 
with a pleasing aroma.  It is also occasionally 
processed for charcoal.   
 
Pinyons have been cut for private and commercial 
use for Christmas trees.  These beautiful little trees 
are slow growing but should be more widely used for 
ornamental purposes.  Two-needle pinyon is the state 
tree of New Mexico.

seeds rest in a deep depression on each cone scale 
and a flap of tissue holds them in place, so the seeds 
are readily available to birds.  The common name 
represents a species of pinyon pine producing two 
needles per bundle.  The Spanish “piñon” refers to 
the large seed (pine in Spanish is “pino”).   
 
Variation within the species: the California outlier of 
two-needle pinyon has been considered a distinct 
species, California Pine (Pinus californiarum) 
(Bailey 1987), or a population of 2-needled trees of 
single-leaf pinyon (Pinus monophylla var. 
californiarum).  Pinus edulis var. fallax is seen by 
some to combine features of P. edulis and P. 
monophylla – but it has most recently been treated as 
part of other species (P. californiarum subsp. fallax. 
P. monophylla var. fallax).  The differences in 
opinion regarding these species of pinyon pine are 
further reflected in the observation that even the 
typical form of P. edulis has been treated as a variety 
of both P. monophylla and P. cembroides.  Naturally 
occurring hybrids have been reported between two-
needle pinyon and single-leaf pinyon in several areas.

years of age but produce significant quantities of seed 
only after reaching 75-100 years old.  Good seed 
crops occur every 4 to 7 years (on average) or more 
frequently on better sites, and cone bearing tends to 
be synchronous over large geographical areas.  
Germination is generally above 80%.   
 
A relationship of mutual benefit exists between two-
needle pinyon and four species of corvid birds: 
Clark’s nutcracker, Steller’s jay, scrub jay, and 
 
 
pinyon jay.  These birds are the primary agents of 
dispersal of this pine, which provides a large portion 
of their diet and subsistence, but only the scrub jay 
and pinyon jay cache seeds in the pinyon-juniper 
zone and are responsible for its regeneration.   
 
Seed germination and establishment of the two-
needle pinyon are best in the shade of trees or shrubs 
and probably depend on an adequate moisture supply 
during the first summer.  Growth through all stages is 
extremely slow.  Dominant trees in a stand are often 
400 years old, and individuals 800-1000 years old 
have been found.

which grove is the most productive.  Since trees can 
reach ages of more than 600 years, some of the tribal 
pinyon gathering sites have been visited for many 
generations.  Tools and harvesting methods are 
purposefully designed to enhance or maintain future  
pinyon cone production.  There are two major 
harvesting methods utilized today by different tribes.  
The first method is to use a hooked stick that brings 
down the flexible limbs of the tree and the green, 
immature cones are hand-twisted from the branches 
before they open and disperse their seeds.  The 
hooked stick can also be used to snap cones off the 
limbs.  Sometimes children climb the trunks of the 
trees and hand pick the cones, while others use 
ladders as a replacement for the hooked sticks.  
Harvested cones are placed in plastic buckets, a 
modern adaptation of the gathering basket.  A second 
gathering method is to wait until the cones open, and 
then whip the trees with a pole, knocking the seeds 
out of the mature cones and collecting them from the 
ground.  During this process, dead or dying branches 
are pruned back, a practice various tribes say is good 
for the trees. 
 
Other: Early Euro-American settlers of the Great 
Basin logged pinyon trees, for wood, fuel for heating, 
cooking, and to supply steam engines.  Pinyon 
charcoals were used to smelt the silver ores that 
became Nevada s number one industry in the 1860 s 
and 70 s.  In the last three decades, public land 
agencies chained large tracts of pinyon trees and 
reseeded areas with non-native grasses, such as 
crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum) to increase 
grasses for livestock.  Other main uses of singleleaf 
pinyon include fence posts, Christmas trees, and 
edible seeds. 
 
Wildlife: Many kinds of birds and small mammals 
feed on the seeds including white-footed pinyon mice 
(Peromyscus truei), chipmunks (Tamias spp.), 
golden-mantled ground squirrels (Spermophilus 
lateralis), wood rats (Neotoma spp.), white-breasted 
nuthatches (Sitta carolinensis), Clark s nutcrackers 
(Nucifraga columbiana) and chickadees (Parus spp.).  
Black bears, deer, and porcupines feed on the seeds, 
bark, and foliage of the pinyon pine, while mountain 
sheep browse the foliage and twigs.  The inner bark is 
a staple food of the mountain pine beetle, as well as 
the fungus causing pinyon blister rust.  Even the 
pitch, dripping from pinecones is feasted upon by 
pitch midges, and is harvested for the nests of 
Dianthidium bees.  Saw flies feed on either needles

Ethnobotanic: Traditionally different tribes in 
California, the Great Basin, and the Southwest U.S. 
have utilized this tree for fuel wood and the pine nuts 
for food.  The Washoe have made pinyon supple 
branches into stirring sticks for mixing pine nut soup.  
Pinyon pitch is melted and applied by different tribes 
as an outer covering for baskets to make them 
watertight or used to waterproof and repair pottery 
vessels.  The tree s large, orange-red to chocolate-
brown seeds have been an important food to Native 
Americans for millennia and are extremely important 
today.  The cones are still gathered in the fall by 
tribes in California, the Great Basin and the 
Southwest roasted, parched, shelled, winnowed, 
ground into a meal, and made into nutritious pine nut 
soup, mush, and cakes.  Another modern way to 
prepare the pine nuts, is to roast them in the oven in 
their shells, and then shelled and eaten as a snack.  
Since the trees produce good crops every several 
years, each family relies on a series of groves, 
rotating harvests at different groves--depending upon

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Description='General: Pine Family (Pinacaeae).  Singleleaf pinyon 
is an evergreen tree reaching heights of up to 12 
meters.  When young, it forms a pyramidal or 
rounded silhouette against the sky, while mature 
pinyons display a more ungroomed, irregular 
branching appearance.  The cylindrical, bluish-gray 
leaves are generally one per bundle and 1 to 2 in. in 
length.  The female cones are wind-pollinated.  The 
subglobose cones ripen in August of the second 
growing season, full of 1/2-inch long, wingless seeds. 
Pinyon trees produce cones every three to seven 
years.  Trees usually do not start bearing cones before 
they are 35 years old and do not start producing good 
seed crops before 100 years.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Adaptation: Singleleaf pinyon often grows in 
association with California juniper (Juniperus 
californica), Sierra juniper (J. occidentalis), or Utah 
juniper (J. osteosperma) with an understory of shrubs 
and grasses such as basin sagebrush (Artemisia 
californica), saltbush (Atriplex spp.), rabbitbrush 
(Chrysothamnus spp.), antelope brush (Purshia spp.), 
hopsage (Grayia spinosa), Indian ricegrass 
(Achnatherum hymenoides), blue-bunch wheatgrass 
(Pseudoroegneria spicatum subsp. spicatum), and 
Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis). 
 
Planting: This slow-growing tree is rarely seen in 
cultivation.  The seeds of pinyon need 1-3 months 
stratification to break winter dormancy before 
 
 
planting unless the maximum germinating 
temperature is below 73 degrees F.   
 
Low elevation/warm winters: Stratification is best 
done between the months of January and March.  
One method is to take two cups of sponge rock or 
perlite (expanded obsidian) and put it in a sieve and 
submerge it in water and let it drain.  The moistened 
perlite is then put in a plastic Ziploc™ bag and 24 
pinyon seeds (with shells removed) are placed in the 
perlite.  Remove much of the air and zip up the bag.  
Place the bag on a tray and put it in the back of the 
refrigerator for three months.  Check seeds weekly 
for mold and discard any moldy material.  If the 
medium is dry, remoisten it, and make sure that the 
bag is completely sealed. 
 
Those that germinate should be planted with the root 
pointing straight down in deep tree tubes in well-
drained soils until ready for out-planting.  Plant 2-3 
germinated seeds in soil 1/8 inch deep in each tube.  
Place the tubes in filtered shade or on the north or 
east side of a building or under a tree.  Any leaf litter 
that falls on the tubes should be removed.  The tubes 
need to be protected from small mammals with the 
construction and placement of a cage over the tubes.  
Water the tubes once a week or more whenever the 
top of the soil is dry to the touch. 
 
Pinyon pine is slow growing and should be watered 
and kept in tubes for one year.  After that time, plant 
in well-drained soil to avoid the possibility of fungus 
and in full exposure to sun in October, ideally just 
before a good soaking rain.  If the climate is really 
hot, put a shade or shingle on one side of the tree to 
protect it from southwest sunlight.  Create a basin 
that is one foot wide and four or five inches deep.  
Make sure the downhill side of the berm is higher 
than the uphill side so the water will not run-off.  
Water deeply, but infrequently for the first two to 
three years after planting.  If there is a problem with 
voles, mice, deer, rabbits, antelope, and other animals 
undermining the roots and girdling the seedlings 
precautions need to be taken to create above and 
below-ground wire mesh or tubes that protect the 
seedlings until they get fully established.  Singleleaf 
pinyon pines are frost-resistant and extremely 
drought-tolerant, once established. 
 
High elevation/cold winters: The seeds from 
singleleaf pinyon pine can be directly planted just 
after harvest in tree tubes, placing 3 or 4 seeds per 
tube one-eighth inch deep.  Set tubes outside and 
subjected to freezing temperatures until spring.  They 
are then watered as soon as the ground thaws out and 
the soil surface becomes dry to the touch.  The 

Page 3
seedlings are watered regularly (unless rains suffice) 
until out-planted the following spring (one year later) 
as soon as the ground thaws out.  Once out-planted, 
continue to water for the first two to three years and 
continue to protect the seedlings from large grazing 
animals and small mammals.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='Fire harms pinyon trees.  When the tree reaches 
adulthood Native Americans traditionally prune back 
any dead wood that may accumulate.  As a strategy to 
protect the pinyon trees from fire, some tribes in 
California and the Great Basin rake litter and duff 
from under pinenut trees and hand remove shrubs 
that might act as a fuel ladder during a fire.  They 
prune back low-lying limbs under the trees that could 
catch fire.  Historically many areas in the pinyon 
juniper forests that were places where people 
habitually camped or collected pine nuts were 
carefully cleaned of underbrush as part of routine and 
necessary maintenance.   
 
The pinyon pine engraver (Ips confusus) is a bark 
beetle that inhabits pinyon pine.  The brown beetles 
bore egg galleries along the grain of the wood.  
Dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium campylopodum) taps 
pinyon limbs for water and nutrients, causing a 
hormonal imbalance, swelling in the plant, and acting 
as a food sump. Pinyon pine is subject to attacks by a 
host of other pathogens, most of which weaken but 
do not kill the tree.  This include needlecast fungi 
(Bifusella pini) which inhabits the needles, pinyon 
bluster rust (Cronartium occidentale) which infects 
the living branches, and elytroderma disease 
(Elytroderma deformans) which upsets the hormonal 
balance causing bud stimulation.  This leads to the 
production of extra branches which gives the tree a 
brooming effect.  Brown crumbly rot (Fomitopsis 
pinicola), a heart rot fungus, will decimate senescent 
trees.  It moves from the heartwood into the roots, 
rotting them, and the tree falls over.

Uses 
Cultural:  Grooveless  stone  axes  and  adzes  found  in 
archaeological contexts in the southeastern United States 
reflect  considerable  Indian  use  of  wood  resources  in 
southeastern  forests  (Delcourt  et  al.  1993).  One  of  the 
most  important  of  these  wood  resources  was  the  pines. 
Pines had many uses among southeastern tribes, but often 
the kind of pine used is not identified. Given that in the 
past,  longleaf  pine  dominated  many  landscapes  in  the 
Southeast, it is likely that it was utilized for many of the 
purposes  described  here.  The  Choctaw  made  darts  that 
were used in blowguns from splinters of pine, sharpened 
at one end (Bushnell 1909). Tribes of the Southeast used 
pine wood for house frames, canoes, frames for skin boats 
or  rafts,  and  bows  (Swanton  1946).  The  Creek  and 
Choctaw used pine bark to cover the roofs of their houses 
(Swanton 1931, 1946. Walker 2004). The Cherokee made  
canoes out of logs of large pines and they were hollowed

The  Choctaw-Apache  Tribe  of  Ebarb  located  in  Sabine 
Parish,  Louisiana,  utilized  the  longleaf  pine  wood  for 
many purposes: as kindling for fires and for constructing 
log  homes,  cribs  for  livestock  use,  and  slat  houses 
(Rogers 2012). The slat homes were constructed of boards 
hewn from a longleaf pine log (see figures 2 - 4) (Rogers 
2012).  The  Adai  Caddo  also  made  log  or  slat  homes 
(Rogers 2012).  
 
The  Alabama  Coushatta,  Chitimacha,  Adai  Caddo, 
Louisiana  Coushatta  (Koasati),  Tunica-Biloxi  Tribe  of 
Louisiana, Clifton Choctaw, Four Winds Tribe Louisiana 
Cherokee Confederacy, Choctaw-Apache Tribe of Ebarb, 
Seminole,  and  Houma  used  and  continue  to  use  the 
distinct  long  needles  of  longleaf  pine  in  the  making  of 
baskets  (figures  5-8)  (Gettys  1979.  Kniffen  et  al.  1987. 
Rogers  2012.  S.  Turnbaugh  and  W.  Turnbaugh  1986). 
The needles are gathered in the spring  while still on  the 
tree or fall from the ground and dried in a cool place out 
of direct sunlight (Rogers 2012).

Once dry the sheaths of the needles are clipped or scraped 
off  and  discarded  and  the  needles  are  stored  in  paper 
sacks or other breathable containers until needed (Rogers 
2012).  Before  using  dried  needles,  they  are  soaked  in 
water  to  regain  their  flexibility  and  then  used  (Rogers 
2012).  The  long  pine  needles  are  coiled,  and  sewn  in 
place  with  the  inner  bark  of  dogwood  or  slippery  elm 
(Kniffen et al. 1987). The Louisiana Coushatta tribe was 
among  the  first  practitioners  of  the  coiled  pine  needle 
basket technique and they are still known for their skill at 
making longleaf pine needle baskets and trays.

Both  the  Louisiana  and  Texas  Coushatta  are  known  for 
their  round  and  oval  baskets,  which  may  be  decorated 
with  flowers  or  pine  cones  (figure  6).  Pine  needle  trays 
have  also  been  made  since  the  1930s.The  Coushatta  are 
also  known  for  making  pine  needle  effigy  baskets  in 
numerous animal shapes.

It takes large quantities of pine needles to make a basket 
and today locating enough sources of needles is difficult 
in  Louisiana  (Rogers  2012)  and  many  parts  of  the 
Southeast.  
 
Non-Indian  women  in  the  early  to  mid-part  of  the 
twentieth  century  made  longleaf  pine  needle  baskets  for 
gathering  fruits  and  berries,  vegetables  and  flowers,  and 
also  eggs  from  the  barnyard  (Tappan  1930).  They  also 
made  them  for  decoration  and  pine  needle  basketry  was 
taught in local schools (Hammel 1917). The favored time 
for gathering the needles was autumn (Lang 1926). 
 
Many early non-Indian settlers in the Southeastern United 
States  considered  longleaf  pine  the  most  valuable  of  all 
the kinds of pines (Porcher 1991). They found medicinal 
value in longleaf pine using turpentine as a stimulant and 
diuretic, and if taken in large doses, it served as a laxative 
(Porcher  1991).  The  turpentine  was  also  used  in  the 
making  of  soap.  The  buds  of  the  pine  or  the  inner  bark 
was  steeped  in  water  and  drunk  as  a  cure  for  colds  and 
coughs (Porcher 1991). As non-Indian settlers moved into 
the area, they  grazed their sheep, hogs, and cattle in  the 
open  understories  of  these  pine  forests  and  hogs  also 
consumed  the  pine  nuts  (Porcher  1991).  By  the  late 
1700’s  Europeans  and  Americans  had  created  an 
increased  demand  for  naval  stores  where  the  wood  was 
employed in the siding of ships, masts, yardarms and for 
floorboards in buildings (Porcher 1991). The tree took on 
great  economic  importance  in  Western  society  for  saw 
timber.  The  second-growth 
longleaf  pine  became 
important for lumber, pulpwood, crossties, boxes, crates, 
fuelwood, and in producing turpentine and rosin (Mattoon 
1922).  Two  distinct  pine  products,  tar  derived  by  slow-
burning  pine  wood  in  a  kiln,  and  pitch  made  from  tar 
boiled  in  a  kettle  or  cauldron  were  used  to  seal  naval 
ships, making them watertight (Earley 2004). At one time, 
the  bulk  of  the  turpentine  produced  in  the  United  States 
came  from  southeastern  longleaf  pine  forests  (Mattoon 
1922).  Forest  examiner  Wilbur  Mattoon  commented  in 
1922  on  the  extensive  destruction  of  young  stands  that 
were worked heavily for these products. 
   
Today  young  stands  of  longleaf  pine  can  produce  pine 
straw  mulch, a very important regional product obtained 
from  longleaf  pine  stands  beginning  at  about  age  8, 
peaking  at  age  18  and  sometimes  continuing  for  many 
more years (Wallace and Ward, 2011. Ward, 2011).  Care 
must be taken if pine straw is to be harvested sustainably 
and  native  understory  plants  conserved  (Ward,  2011).  
Mature  longleaf  forests  produce  high  quality  timber 
products including utility poles, lumber and pulpwood. 
   
Wildlife:  Many  kinds  of  animals  are  associated  with  the 
groundcover in longleaf pine forests. In fact, the majority 
of  the  biological  diversity  in  longleaf  forests  is  in  the 
understory, not the tree canopies (Simberloff 1993). Wild 
turkeys  (Meleagris  gallapavo),  fox  squirrels  (Sciurus 
niger),  and  gopher  tortoises  (Gopherus  polyphemus)  all

During  the  1960’s  Coushatta  women  produced  a  wide 
array  of  animals:  bear,  crabs,  crayfish,  frogs,  etc.  The 
Louisiana  Coushatta have also planted long  leaf pine on 
their land near Elton in the southwestern part of the state, 
so they can continue to make baskets in the future (Rogers 
2012).

use  the  longleaf  pine  understory.  The  gopher  tortoise  is 
crucial to longleaf pine communities because at least 332 
other animal species use its burrows such as Florida mice 
(Podomys 
(Drymarchon 
couperi),  and  gopher  frogs  (Rana  capito)  (Jackson  and 
Milstrey  1989.  Franz  1984).  The  gopher  tortoise  is  a 
species  of  special  concern—declining  through  loss  of 
habitat and lack of fire in existing habitats (Barlow 2004). 
In  one  study  higher  densities  were  found  in  open  areas 
with  herbaceous  ground  cover  and  bare  soil  and  much 
lower  in  areas  of  higher  shade  and  shrub  cover  (Barlow 
2004). The red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) 
and  the  Bachman’s  sparrow  (Aimophila  aestivalis)  are 
two  of  many  federally  listed  species  that  inhabit  the 
endangered  longleaf  pine-wiregrass  ecosystem  of  the 
southeastern  coastal  plain  (Noss  et  al.  1995).  With 
changed  fire  regimes,  other  birds  that  frequent  longleaf 
pine  are  declining  such  as  the  brown-headed  nuthatch 
(Sitta  pusilla),  loggerhead  shrike  (Lanius  ludovicianus), 
and  eastern  bluebird  (Sialia  sialis)  (Cox  1987  cited  in 
Barlow 2004). Longleaf stands are also highly valued for 
wildlife  habitat  necessary  for  bobwhite  quail  (Colinus 
virginianus).

Description 
General:  The  tree  grows  up  to  120  feet  tall  (37  meters) 
tall,  with  a  rounded  crown.  The  orange-brown  trunk  is 
straight,  up  to  30  inches  (76  cm)  in  diameter  and  it  has 
coarse,  rectangular,  scaly  plates  (Harlow  and  Harrar, 
1969).  The  leaves  are  25-40  cm.  long  and  are  in  threes 
that  are  persistent  for  2  years  (Gleason  and  Cronquist 
1991.  Radford  et  al.  1968).  Longleaf  pine  has  a  deep 
taproot  and  a  definite  grass  stage  (Kral  1993).  The  seed 
cones are solitary or paired 15 cm. long.  A heavy crop of 
pine cones bearing seed occurs at intervals of about every 
seven  years  and  the  seeds  require  two  years  to  mature 
(Mattoon 1922).  
 
Distribution:  The  forest  grows  from  0-700  m  and  once 
occupied a belt extending through the Coastal Plain from 
extreme  southern  Virginia  to  the  Everglades  in  Florida 
and west into Texas, originally covering about 92 million 
acres prior to European settlement (Shantz and Zon 1924. 
Frost 1993). Though confined mostly to the Coastal Plain, 
longleaf can also be encountered in parts of the Piedmont, 
as  well  as  the  southern  foothills  of  the  Appalachian 
Mountains  (Earley  2004).  When  the  Spanish  arrived  in 
the early 1500s, longleaf pine was the dominant tree over 
60 million acres of the Southeast, and it grew in mixtures 
with  other  pines  and  hardwoods  on  an  additional  30 
million acres (Earley 2004).  Presently longleaf occupies 
only  3.4  million  acres  (America’s  Longleaf  2009). 
Longleaf  pine  communities  have  been  reduced  to  about 
three  percent  of  their  original  area,  due  to  logging, 
turpentining,  open  range  grazing  by  hogs  and  other 
livestock,  fire  suppression,  clearing  for  agriculture,  and 
urban development (Frost 1993). The longleaf pine forests 
of  Texas  and  Louisiana  have  declined  by  eighty-five 
percent since 1935 (Bridges and Orzell 1989 cited in Noss 
et.  al  1995).  Ninety-eight  percent  of  the  presettlement 
longleaf pine forests in the Southeastern Coastal Plain are 
gone (Noss et al. 1995). Longleaf pine forests of Florida 
have dwindled by eighty-eight percent (Kautz 1993 cited 
in Noss et al. 1995). Lawrence S. Earley (2004) estimates 
that  the  majority  of  old-growth  longleaf  pine  forest  is 
gone—with  a  mere  12,000  acres  remaining  in  scattered 
stands. 
 
Habitat:  Longleaf  pine  grows  in  pure  stands  over  large 
areas and has the ability to grow on poor, dry, and poorly 
drained  soils  (Mattoon  1922).  It  is  found  in  dry  sandy 
uplands, sandhills, savannas, wet flatwoods of the coastal 
plain  from  Virginia  to  Texas,  as  well  as  montane  sites 
including  dry,  rocky  ridgetop  areas  in  Alabama  and 
Georgia (Estes 2006). The region experiences from 40 to 
60 inches of rain a year.

Adaptation 
Longleaf  pine  forests  are  adapted  to  the  disturbances  of 
fire  and  hurricanes  and  frequent  low  intensity  burns  are 
important  in  maintaining  variable  horizontal  structure  in 
this  plant  community  (Landers  et  al  1995.  Estes  2006). 
Longleaf pine is remarkably resistant to fire. It puts out an 
extensive  root  system  following  seed  germination, 
enabling  the  seedling  to  sprout  from  its  root  collar  if 
defoliated  by  fire  (Carey  1992.  Ware  et  al.  1993).  The 
terminal bud of the seedling is protected from the heat of 
grass  fires  by  a  rosette  of  long,  green  needles  and  older 
growth  has  a  thick,  fire-resistant  bark  (Watson  1940. 
Carey  1992).  The  large  seeds  germinate  best  on  bare 
mineral soil—an effective way to create these conditions 
is  through  prescribed  burning  (Garren  1943  cited  in 
Wagner 2003. Watson 1940). 
 
 
When  the  earliest  explorers  came  into  the  southeastern 
United  States,  they  commented  on  the  wide  spacing  of 
longleaf pine trees. Early ecologists such as B.W. Wells 
marveled at the size of the old-growth trees, measuring a 
yard  or  more  in  basal  diameter  (Wells  1932  cited  in 
Earley 
describe 
Southeastern Indian burning practices in the longleaf pine 
forests  for  many reasons such as to  facilitate  hunting by 
opening  the  woods,  encourage  forage  for  wildlife,  and 
control insects (Earley 2004. Lawson 1967).

season  burn  (April-June)  is  necessary  to  reduce  the 
number and vigor of hardwood sprouts (Jose et. al.2006). 
If  competing  vegetation  is  not  controlled,  longleaf  will 
remain in the “grass stage” for up to 15 years, rather than 
the minimum of 2 years (Jose et. al.  2006). Seedlings in 
the grass stage are capable of re-sprouting if damaged or 
top-killed (Jose et. al.  2006).  Height growth can be rapid 
once  seedlings  emerge  from  the  grass  stage.    Young 
stands of longleaf tend to quickly develop a range of size 
classes  reducing  the  risk  of  stagnation  and  the  need  for 
pre-commercial thinning (Burns 1983).

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_ TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_='Pests and Diseases 
The longleaf pine has two serious enemies—the hog and 
the  brown  spot  needle  disease  (Septoria  acicola)  which 
causes  defoliation.  Hogs  root  the  seedlings  up  and  can 
live on the stored food material in the roots. The needle 
disease  is  caused  by  a  fungus  which  is  often  a  very 
serious  enemy  of  the  young  seedlings  underneath  a 
“rough” of dead grass. Burning the dead grass in winter at 
intervals  of  more  than  one  year  can  control  this  disease 
(Chapman  1941.  Greene  1931).    Longleaf  pine  is  less

susceptible 
frontalis,  and  pitch  canker,  Fusarium  moniliforme  var. 
subglutinans than other southern pines.

These fires were frequent, every two to four years (Rogers 
2012). The time of year for most Indian-set fires was fall 
to  winter  (Ware  et  al.  1993).  Together,  lightning  and 
Indian-set  fires  created  the  open  forests  that  Europeans, 
such as William Bartram, observed in the Southeast. 
 
Many of the ecosystems where longleaf pine grows, such 
as the pine flatwood ecosystem, are fire dependent. Pine 
flatwoods  have  a  fire  frequency  of  every  one  to  eight 
years  (Behm  2003).  Numerous  studies  demonstrate  that 
prescribed  burning  can  help  put  cutover  longleaf  lands 
back into timber production without planting (Bruce and 
Bickford  1950).  Longleaf  pine  grows  best  with  low-
intensity fires spaced one to three years apart (Kalisz et al. 
1986. Myers 1985 cited in Wagner 2003). Some research 
suggests that many longleaf pine sites have been replaced 
by  hardwoods  and  other  species  of  pines  (Boyer  1990. 
Frost  1993.  Myers  and  Peroni  1983).  Many  of  these 
vegetation changes are in part a result of shifts in the fire 
regimes,  likely  due  to  a  decrease  in  Indian  burning  and 
lightning fire suppression.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_='Establishment and Management 
Seeds  of  longleaf  pine  are  the  largest  of  the  southern 
pines. They do not store well and are best planted in the 
fall after collection between  October and November and 
test  for  seed  viability  prior  to  planting.    Longleaf  is 
mostly regenerated with bare root or container seedlings.  
Best results are obtained with container seedlings, planted 
slightly  above  ground  level  when  soil  is  moist  between 
November  and  March.  Planting  rates  vary  from  300  to 
900 per acre but the most commonly recommended rate is 
600-700  per  acre  (Longleaf  Pine  Partnership  Council 
2013). 
  Longleaf  is  very  susceptible  to  competing 
vegetation.    Competing  vegetation  must  be  controlled 
either chemically or mechanically with seedlings planted 
in the center of a weed free area with a radius of at least 
15 inches (Longleaf Alliance 2009).  If there is a history 
of  cultivation  sub-soiling  will  be  necessary  to  break  up 
soil compaction (Longleaf Alliance 2009).  Prescribed fire 
applied at an interval of 1-3 years is necessary to exclude 
hardwood  trees  and  shrubs  and  maintain  a  natural 
understory of grasses and forbs.  An occasional growing

could be easily opened by placing them on or near a 
fire.  Pine nuts were eaten whole or pounded into 
flour that was made into porridge or mixed with other 
foods.  The young, male catkins are edible and said to 
have a nice flavor either raw or cooked (Couplan 
1998).  During heavy winters or times of scarcity the 
inner bark of pine trees would serve as an emergency 
food.   
 
The needles of pines, which contain vitamin C, were 
brewed into a tea that was drunk to treat headaches 
(Heinsen 1972).  The Costanoan and others chewed 
pine resin to treat rheumatism.  This resin or pitch 
was used as a salve that was applied to burns and 
sores.  Pine resins were useful as glue or sealant.  
Pine resin was also chewed as gum.  Pine nuts were 
burned into charcoal, crushed, and then applied to 
both sores and burns.  Various Native American 
tribes used the split roots of many pine species as the 
foundation to make fish traps, seed beaters, burden 
and many other types of baskets (Murphey 1959).  
The inner portions of slender new pine twigs could be 
processed into sewing materials (Barrett &amp. Gifford 
1933).   
 
Livestock: Goats browse on Monterey pines.   
 
Wildlife: Black-tailed deer browse the leaves and 
branches of Monterey pine.  Porcupines are known to 
browse on leaves and branches as well as eat the 
bark.  Small mammals including deer mice, 
chipmunks, and ground squirrels eat the seeds.  
Among the birds that eat the seeds are scrub jays, 
Stellar jays, and crows.  Nesting chestnut-backed 
chickadees have been observed to obtain almost 80% 
of their insect diet from foraging in Monterey pine 
trees (Kleintjes &amp. Dahlsten 1994).   
 
Other: Monterey pine is used for erosion control and 
stabilization of steep slopes because it is fast growing 
and has a wide spreading root system.  The trees are 
sometimes used as Christmas trees.

Ethnobotanic: The seeds of all pine species are edible 
and pine nuts have historically been an important 
food utilized by many Native American tribes (Strike 
1994).  Pines were also valued for their wood, sap, 
and pine needles.  Because of its restricted range, few 
tribes used Monterey pine.  The Costanoan and 
probably the Salinan relied on the seeds as a source 
of food in coastal areas of their territory.  Pedro 
Fages (1937) describes the California Indians in the 
Monterey area as using many kinds of pine nuts and 
among them those of Monterey pine.  He writes, “the 
cones of the pine tree are small, and the nuts are 
extremely so, but very good and pleasing to the taste.  
The method of gathering them is to build a fire at the 
foot of the tree, which in a few hours falls, making 
the fruit available without difficulty” (Fages 1937. 
68-69).  Many bedrock mortars are found adjacent to 
Monterey pine forests, which may be additional 
evidence of their use by both tribes (Leonard 1963).  
The closed cones of Monterey pines were probably a 
particularly valuable resource because they remain on 
the tree and can therefore be harvested all through the 
year.  The closed cones open in response to heat and

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Description TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Description='General: Pine family (Pinaceae).  Monterey pines are 
native to California and Baja California where they 
occur in only a few small populations.  Mature 
Monterey pines can reach 38 m in height with trunks 
up to 2 m in diameter.  The young trees begin as 
compact pyramids but age into varied shapes.  The 
adult canopy is usually rounded to flat-topped.  
Along the Pacific coast, the winds sculpt Monterey 
pine canopies into picturesque shapes.  The bark is 
red-brown to blackish brown and has deep furrows.  
The leaves are glossy, dark green needles, 6-15 cm 
long that grow in bundles of three.  Needles on older 
trees are sometimes a bluish green.  Flowers appear 
in late winter or early spring.  The trees are 
monoecious. having both male and female flowers 
(McDonald &amp. Laacke 1990).  The yellow male 
catkins are 12mm long and are generally found on the 
lateral branches.  Female flowers grow throughout 
the entire canopy.  The grayish brown cones are 
asymmetrically oval, 6 to 15 cm long, and are born 
on short stalks in clusters of 3 to 7 cones.  The scales 
are smooth and rounded.  Each cone contains from 
120 to 200 dark brown to black, bumpy winged seeds 
that are 6-7mm long.  The cones remain closed on the 
tree until the second year or sometimes longer.  
Cones generally ripen and open from late winter to 
early spring of the second year.  Thereafter, they may 
remain on the tree where they can open and close 
several times depending on temperature and 
moisture.  The close-grained wood is light and soft.  
Although it is not considered an important lumber 
tree in California, it has been widely planted in areas 
with Mediterranean climates throughout the world for 
use as lumber and pulp.   
 
Distribution: Monterey pines are native to California 
and Baja California.  Native Monterey pine forests 
occupy a small portion of their historical range and 
are currently restricted to five coastal locations: Año 
Nuevo in the north, the Monterey Peninsula, 
Cambria, and on Guadalupe and Cedros islands off 
the coast of Baja, California in the south.   
 
 
 
For current distribution, please consult the Plant 
Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
site.   
 
Habitat: Monterey pines grow below 1200 meters in 
closed cone pine forests and oak woodlands.  The 
species is one of the 18 California species of pines 
and cypresses that bear closed cones (Dallman 
1998:27).  The remaining stands of Monterey pine 
are threatened by numerous factors including 
urbanization, recreational development, and fire 
suppression, pests and diseases.  Fire suppression has 
resulted in very old stands of forest, which are more 
susceptible to attacks from pests and diseases.  In the 
Monterey area, the trees are seriously threatened by 
an epidemic of “pine pitch canker”, a fungal disease 
caused by Fusarium subglutans pini.  This fungus 
was recently introduced to California from the 
southeastern United States and is carried from tree to 
tree by several native insects including the Monterey 
pine cone beetle (Conophthorus radiatae), twig 
beetles (Pitophthorus spp.) and engraver beetles (Ips 
spp.).  Indigenous stands of Monterey pine are also 
threatened by genetic contamination, which results 
from crossbreeding with planted trees that were 
brought in from other areas.   
 
' WHERE symbol='pira2';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Adaptation TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Adaptation='Monterey pines are adapted to soils of medium to 
heavy texture.  Monterey pines have serotinous cones 
that do not release the seeds unless subjected to high 
temperatures.  Superheating may occur on very hot 
days or during fire events.  Because hot days do not 
often occur in the Central Coast of California, 
replenishment of the seed bank is highly dependant 
on fire (Hillyard 1997).   
 
' WHERE symbol='pira2';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Monterey pines are ornamental as well as useful.  
This species is the most widely cultivated pine in the 
world (Templeton et al.  1997).  Monterey pines are 
also the most widely planted trees for choose-and-cut 
Christmas tree farms in California.  They are 
excellent shade trees, act as effective wind and sound 
barriers, and have been used for erosion control.   
 
Be careful to select a proper place to plant these fast 
growing trees.  Monterey pines are the most rapid 
growing pine of over 90 species that occur in the 
world (Labadie 1978).  Young trees can grow up to 2 
meters per year, generally reaching from 12 to 18 
meters within 25 years.  The trees have an average 
life span of 80 to 90 years.   
 
These trees require deep, well drained, medium to 
course textured soils of medium fertility.  Trees that 

Page 3
are planted on shallow or waterlogged soils may be 
unstable because of shallow vertical roots.  Monterey 
pines can be damaged or killed in areas where 
temperatures reach below freezing.   
 
Monterey pines are usually transplanted from 
containers or bare rootstock grown by commercial 
nurseries.  However, these plants usually come from 
New Zealand stock.  Even though the New Zealand 
stock originated from California populations, 
crossbreeding with native populations is considered a 
threat to the native population’s conservation because 
of genetic contamination (Cope 1993).   
 
Seed may propagate Monterey pine trees.  Handpick 
mature cones from the trees or from the ground.  Air-
dry opened cones by spreading them in a sunny, dry 
place.  To open closed cones, drop them into boiling 
water for 1 to 2 minutes or more, if needed.  Remove 
the seeds from the cones by shaking them out.  
Although the cones require heat in order to release 
the seeds, the seeds do not generally require 
pretreatment in order to germinate.  One to three 
weeks of cold-moist stratification may improve 
germination, especially for seeds that have been 
stored (Emery 1988).  Monterey pines are not 
generally propagated by cuttings as, even with 
bottom heat, the cuttings may take four or more 
months to form roots.

pine populations have historically shifted in size and 
location along the California and Baja coasts in 
response to changing climate.  She suggests, that in 
order to allow for the continued survival of Monterey 
pines, establishment of new stands of native stock 
 
 
within the pine’s historical range should be 
considered as opportunities for their conservation and 
not as a threat to other native species.

available (Fielder 1975).   
 
Landscaping &amp. Wildlife: Red pine is an attractive tree 
that is used in recreational areas because of its 
colorful bark.  This species provides cover for many 
species of mammals and birds.  Deer, cottontails, and 
snowshoe hares browse songbirds, mice and 
chipmunks feed on the seed while seedlings.   
 
Agroforestry: Pinus resinosa is used in tree strips for 
windbreaks.  They are planted and managed to 
protect livestock, enhance crop production, and 
control soil erosion.  Windbreaks can help 
communities with harsh winter conditions better 
handle the impact of winter storms and reduce home 
heating costs during the winter months and cooling 
cost in the summer.

sized tree, up to twenty-five meters high and seventy-
five centimeters in diameter (Farar 1995).  The leaves 
are soft and flexible evergreen needles, in clusters of 
two, slender, 4”-6” long, dark green borne in dense 
tufts at the ends of branchlets.  The fruit is ovoid-
conic, with thin scales, becoming light chestnut-
brown at maturity.  The bark is thick and slightly 
divided by shallow fissures into broad flat ridges 
covered by thin loose red-brown scales (Sargent 
1961).  The root system is moderately deep, wide 
spreading, and very wind firm.   
 
Distribution: Red pine is native to northeastern 
United States.  This species ranges from

chilling treatment begins.  Allow three times the air 
space as seed space in the bag.  It is best to sow the 
seeds in May and therefore, expose the seeds to a 
chilling treatment of at least sixteen weeks prior to 
sowing.  After cold stratification, plant the seeds in a 
well-drained coarse potting mix in leach tubes that 
are narrow but deep with two seeds per tube.  These 
containers should allow roots to reach the air and stop 
growing and be at least 6 inches deep.  Fertilize the 
containers with a starter formulation of fertilizer with 
low or zero nitrogen.  These containers can be kept in 
a greenhouse for the first 4 to 6 weeks, receiving 70-
degree temperatures during the day.  Keep the surface 
of the soil moist during the germination phase.  Next 
after the first set of cotyledons, water the plants with 
a deep, thorough soaking and let the plants dry in 
between watering.  Thin the plants down to one per 
container and move the pots into a shade-house with 
30 percent shade after 4 to 6 weeks.  Protect the 
plants from wind and wildlife.  During the main 
summer growing season use a balanced fertilizer 
applied to each container.  At the end of the growing 
season use a finisher formulation of fertilizer.  Plant 
the plants in the ground outside in the late winter or 
early spring in moist soil.  Conduct supplemental 
hand watering or irrigation if the rains are 
insufficient.  Clear weeds in a 3 feet by 3 feet area 
around the plants to encourage better survival and 
growth rate.  Make sure a protective barrier is placed 
around the conifers such as vexar tubing to shield 
them from jack rabbits, deer and other wildlife that 
may feed on the leaves, stems, and roots.

(Moerman 1998).  It has been chewed in the 
treatment of throat problems, coughs, and colds 
(Ibid.).  Sitka spruce pitch was also used as a 
medicine for gonorrhea, syphilis, internal swelling, 
and toothaches (Pojar &amp. MacKinnon 1994).  A 
decoction of the roots has been used in the treatment 
of diarrhea. 
 
Economic: Sitka spruce produces high-grade lumber 
that is the most important wood for airplane and 
glider construction.  In World War II, this wood was 
utilized in the British Mosquito bombers (Viereck &amp. 
Little 1972).  Other important uses are oars, ladders, 
scaffolding, and boats, particularly racing sculls 
(Ibid.).  This wood is valued in making piano 
sounding boards and guitars.  It is harvested as saw 
timber and pulpwood and processed into lumber, 
plywood and various paper products.   
 
Landscaping &amp. Wildlife: Sitka spruce is often planted 
as an ornamental tree in the eastern and northern 
states and in western and northern Europe (Sargent 
1961).  This forest species provides habitat for a large 
variety of mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and birds.  
It is browsed only in the spring by a variety of birds.

green to bluish-green, stiff, very sharp, 1 to 1½ 
inches long, with white lines of stomata on the upper 
surface (Pojar &amp. MacKinnon 1994).  The cones are 
one to four inches long, hanging down, with very thin 
scales, rounded, and irregularly toothed.  The bark is 
gray and smooth on small trunks, becoming dark 
purplish-brown on older trunks.

Ditidaht and other Nuu-chah-nulth peoples used the 
boughs in winter dance ceremonies to protect the 
dancers and scare spectators (Ibid.).  The inner bark 
was eaten fresh, or dried into cakes and eaten with 
berries.  It was also dried and grounded into a powder 
and used as a thickener in soups or added to cereals 
when making bread. 
 
The roots were burnt over an open fire to remove the 
bark, then dried and split to make hats and ropes 
(Moerman 1998).  The roots were also used by 
several native North American tribes to make tightly 
woven baskets that would hold water (Lauriault 
1989).  A pitch obtained from the tree was used as 
glue or as a protective varnish-like coat on wood 
(Moerman 1998).   
 
Sitka spruce was widely employed medicinally by

no pretreatment if the seed is sown fresh, however a 
period of cold unifies and hastens germination (Dirr

year as possible.  Preferably sow the seeds in a

cool place and should not be allowed to dry out.  Put 
seedlings into individual pots when they are large 
enough to handle and grow them in the greenhouse 
for the first winter.  They can be planted into their 
permanent positions in early summer of the following 
year. 
 
Propagation by Cuttings: The cuttings, five to ten 
centimeters long, are cut in June with a heel of older 
wood, treated with 3000 ppm IBA-talc, and placed in 
sand without removal of the needles (Dirr &amp. Heuser 
1987).  After rooting, the cuttings have one to two 
roots that should be pruned to stimulate lateral root

American sycamore is recommended for planting on 
all types of strip-mined land, and it is useful in 
rehabilitation of various sites with saturated soils.  It 
is often a natural early colonizer of disturbed sites 
such as old fields, spoil banks, streambanks degraded 
by channelization, and waterway disposal sites.   
 
Ethnobotanic: Native Americans used sycamore for a 
variety of medicinal purposes, including cold and 
cough remedies, as well as dietary, dermatological, 
gynecological, respiratory, and gastrointestinal aids.

features are the relatively weak limbs (susceptible to 
wind and ice damage) and the large leaves that decay 
slowly after falling.  The huge size quickly attained

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Adaptation TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Adaptation='It often is a pioneer on upland sites in the central part 
of its range, but it is primarily a species of 
bottomland and alluvial soils, also occurring on creek 
banks, mesic coves and lower slopes, on a wide range 
of soil types.  It is a major pioneer species in the 
floodplains of large rivers and occurs on a variety of 
wet sites, including shallow swamps, sloughs, and 
wet river bottoms where soil is saturated 2-4 months 
during the growing season.  Water dispersal often 
results in seed deposition on muddy flats highly 
conducive to germination because seed dispersal 
occurs when water is receding after spring floods.  
American sycamore is most commonly found in 
mixture with sweetgum, boxelder, silver and red 
maple, cottonwood, and willows.  It is found at 0-300 
(-750) meter elevation.      
 
American sycamore can tolerate weeks of flooding, 
even complete submersion of seedlings, provided that 
the water is aerated.  A significant portion of young 
sycamores can survive almost 2 months of 
continuously waterlogged soils during dormancy, but 
sycamore of various stages will die if the entire tree 
is inundated for more than two weeks during the 
growing season.  Saplings top-killed by flooding may 
resprout from the root crown.    
 
Flowers appear with the leaves in April-May or as 
early as late March in the South.  Fruits ripen 
September-October (-November), usually breaking 
up and falling from the tree through the winter and 
into spring.   
  
' WHERE symbol='ploc';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Open-grown American sycamores usually begin 
flowering in 6-7 years.  Natural stands of sycamore 
usually produce appreciable numbers of seed at 
approximately 25 years. optimum seed production 
occurs from 50-200 years of age.  Good seed crops 
are produced every 1-2 years.  Sycamore seeds do not 
require any pretreatment for good germination.  They 
do not germinate well in heavy litter or in deep shade 
or in temperatures outside of 59-86 o Fahrenheit (15-
30 o C.).   
 
Sycamore seedlings require direct sunlight for good 
growth and establishment, except perhaps on clay 
soil.  One-year-old seedlings may reach 10 feet, and 
sprouts may reach 25 feet.  The potentially great size 
of mature trees is correlated with exceptionally rapid 
growth, and maximum age probably does not exceed 
250 years, although Smith (1952) notes that 500-600 
may be the upper range.   
 
' WHERE symbol='ploc';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='American sycamore can be regenerated from natural 
seed sources, by planting, or by stump and root 
sprouting.  On &quot.silvicultural biomass farms&quot. aimed at 
maximum fiber production, fertilization is usually 
necessary, especially with rotations shorter than 5 
years.  Sycamores in managed plantations 
interplanted with legumes or other nitrogen-fixing 
species were larger than control plants 6 years after 
establishment of the nitrogen fixers.  Sycamore has 
good coppice regeneration potential, although it has 
been reported that trees died after two successive 
harvests.  A high percentage of stumps sprout, 
regardless of stump size or time of harvest, although 
larger and heavier sprouts are produced from dormant 
season cuts (vs. growing season).      
 
Significant diseases and insect problems occur in 
managed plantations and landscaping trees of 
American sycamore but are largely absent from 
natural stands.  Important problems include 
anthracnose and eastern mistletoe (Phoradendron 
spp.).   
 
Prescribed fire is not recommended for bottomland 
forests in which sycamore occurs.  Bottomland fires 
usually move rapidly along the surface, consuming 
shrubs and herbs and usually killing saplings and 
seedlings of all species.  Larger trees suffer bark 
wounds that create points of entry for rots, stains, and 
insects.  Under extreme conditions, large trees may

Wildlife: Narrow-leaf cottonwood provides habitat, 
cover, and food for a diversity of wildlife.  Common 
residents include squirrels, aquatic fur bearers, bears, 
white-tailed deer, and many bird species.  Twigs and 
leaves are browsed by rabbits, deer, and moose and 
buds and catkins are eaten by quail and grouse.  
Beaver cut all sizes of cottonwoods to build and 
maintain lodges and dams and use the bark for 
immediate food or storage in winter caches. 
 
Conservation: Narrow-leaf cottonwood is planted as 
a fast-growing ornamental tree in western US cities.  
These trees can be used at high elevations and are 
useful in landscaping on deer winter ranges since 
deer will not damage them through overbrowsing.  
The species was early encountered (in1805) by the 
Lewis and Clark expedition, who observed that 
horses would not eat it.   
 
The aggressively spreading root system of narrow-
leaf cottonwood makes it useful for soil stabilization 
in erosion control and streambank reclamation 
projects.  This same feature, however, may be a 
liability in urban areas where the roots may clog 
drains and sewers.   
 
Ethnobotanic: Native Americans used young 
cottonwood shoots to make baskets.

allowing more light penetration, and exposing 
mineral soil.  Narrow-leaf cottonwood is a fast-
growig but short-lived species in natural conditions.      
 
Narrow-leaf cottonwood reproduces vegetatively by

' WHERE symbol='poan3';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;

Otherwise they may be kept viable by drying and 
storing cold in an airtight container.  In a cold frame, 
sow on the surface or lightly cover the seeds.  Plant 
into permanent positions either in late summer or the 
following spring, depending on growth of the young 
plants.   
 
Cuttings of twigs 20–45 cm long and 1-3 cm 
diameter of the current season s growth, taken during 
the dormant season, can be placed in a sheltered 
outdoor bed or directly into permanent positions.  
Initial growth of un-rooted cuttings may not be as 
rapid as that of rooted cuttings.  Cuttings grown in a 
mist-propagator also root easily and survive potting.  
Nursery- or container-grown seedlings and rooted 
cuttings establish easily and grow rapidly on moist 
well-drained soils in full sun.  Growth may be 
minimal on wet soils and upland sites.   
 
Beaver activities may inhibit cottonwood 
regeneration. seedlings and saplings are stripped of 
bark for food and larger trees are cut for building 
material.  Poorly oxygenated water in stagnant ponds 
causes a decline in health.  Severe grazing by 
livestock, and associated trampling of seedlings, 
reduces cottonwood regeneration potential.   
 
The aggressive root systems can invade and damage 
drainage systems and also may heavily draw 
available moisture from gardens and building 
foundations, especially in clay soil.  Root suckers 
also may be considered a maintenance problem, and 
the profuse production of cottony seed from female 
plants can be a minor nuisance.  
 

Page 3
Narrow-leaf cottonwood will produce stump sprouts 
and root suckers after light to moderate intensity 
fires.  Seedlings, saplings, and young trees are 
damaged or killed by fire, but they develop more fire-
resistant bark after 15-20 years of age.  Older trees 
may be killed by even relatively cool fires, which 
wound trees and open the way to heartwood decay.  
Where spruce is climax, periodic fire may contribute 
to the maintenance of cottonwood stands, but mature 
bottomland hardwood stands will not persist in the 
face of fire.

into their genetics and physiology.  These are 
extremely fast-growing and biomass-productive 
when grown as short-rotation coppice or single 
stems.  On good sites, hybrid poplars grow faster than 
any other northern temperate region tree and hybrids 
are usually more widely adaptable than the parents.  
They are easily propagated from stem cuttings, but 
because of quick re-sprouting, replanting after 
harvesting may be unnecessary, especially for short 
harvest cycles.  These trees have great potential for 
conservation and ornamental plantings, paper, and 
lumber and plywood.  The wood is similar to that of 
native black cottonwood, and branches and tops left 
from pulp harvests can be converted to pelletized fuel 
for use in power stations and home heaters.   
 
Wildlife: Black cottonwood provides food and cover 
for a variety of wildlife species, including deer, elk, 
and beaver.  Large birds use the crowns for nesting 
sites and various animals rely on the trunk cavities, 
which commonly result from heart rot in most stands 
nearing maturity.  The rotten trunks of black 
cottonwood provide an important wildlife habitat 
otherwise scarce, especially of the Cascades.   
 
Ethnobotanic: Disinfectant properties of resin from 
buds were discovered by Native Americans, who 
used the resin to treat sore throats, coughs, lung pain, 
and rheumatism.  It is still used in some modern 
natural health ointments.  Soap was produced from 
the inner bark.  The wood was used to make friction 
fire sets.   
 
Conservation: Black cottonwood is a very fast-
growing and potentially large tree, easy to establish, 
and useful for shade and ornament.  Black 
cottonwood also has been planted as windbreaks and 
shelterbelts and it is commonly used for screening 
along motorways in Europe.  The aggressive root 
systems of black cottonwood are effective soil 
stabilizers and make the species useful in restoration 
of riparian areas, where it also provides protection for 
the aquatic environment, especially in helping to 
maintain low water temperatures through shading.  
The high nitrate uptake and extensive rooting of these 
trees make them useful for buffer or &quot.filter&quot. planting 
along streams in agricultural areas.

Variation within the species: black cottonwood is 
most commonly and widely known as the distinct 
species Populus trichocarpa but is sometimes treated 
as Populus balsamifera var. trichocarpa, the western 
North American segment of the broader species P. 
balsamifera (Brayshaw 1965, 1976).  Black 
cottonwood and balsam cottonwood have similar 
appearances, biological features, and ecology, and 
they hybridize and introgress where their ranges 
overlap.  Still, they have essentially separate 
geographic ranges, and, like various other species of 
Populus that are separated by relatively small 
differences, black cottonwood and balsam poplar 
differ in a number of technical features, as partly 
summarized here.

habitats, and moist woods on mountain slopes, at 
elevations of  0–2100(–2750) meters.  It often forms 
extensive stands on bottomlands of major streams 
and rivers at low elevations along the Pacific Coast, 
west of the Cascade Range.  In eastern Washington 
and other dry areas, it is restricted to protected 
valleys and canyon bottoms, along streambanks, and 
edges of ponds and meadows.  It grows on a variety 
of soils from moist silts, gravels, and sands to rich 
humus, loams, and occasionally clays.    
 
Black cottonwood is a pioneer species that grows 
best in full sunlight and commonly establishes on 
recently disturbed alluvium.  Seeds are numerous and 
widely dispersed because of their cottony tufts, 
enabling the species to colonize even burn sites, if 
conditions for establishment are met.  Seral 
communities dominated or codominated by 
cottonwood are maintained by periodic flooding or 
other types of soil disturbance.  Black cottonwood 
has low drought tolerance. it is flood-tolerant but 
cannot tolerate brackish water or stagnant pools.   
 
Flowering occurs in late March to May (-June), just 
before or during leaf emergence and fruiting occurs 
in late May to early or mid-July.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Black cottonwood begins producing seed at about 8-
10 years – abundant seed is usually produced every 
year.  Seeds under natural conditions are short-lived, 
usually for less than a month.  Seed will readily 
germinate on a variety of favorable sites, particularly 
where mineral soil has been exposed or new soil 
deposited.  High germination rates and seedling 
survival depend on continuously moist conditions, 
such as in fresh alluvium, during the first month.   
 
Maximum height and size are usually reached in 60-
75 years although some may continue to grow well 
past that.  Maximum age is at least 200 years.   
 
Black cottonwood sprouts readily from the stump and 
roots as well as from branches and logs that are left 
after logging.  Small shoots with green leaves abscise 
naturally and either root where they fall or are water-
transported some distance before they root.

cottonwood can invade and damage drainage systems 
and also may heavily draw available moisture from 
gardens and building foundations, especially in clay 
soil.  Root suckers also may be considered a 
maintenance problem, and the profuse production of 
cottony seed from female plants can be a minor 
nuisance.  The shallow root system of black 
cottonwood, especially on wet soils, make the species 
susceptible to damage from ice storms, heavy snow, 
and wind.  Unseasonably early or late frosts may 
damage saplings, but in dormancy, it is one of the 
most frost-resistant trees in the northwestern USA.    
 
Black cottonwood is susceptible to fire damage 
because of its thin bark and shallow root system.  
Seedlings and saplings are usually killed by fire of 
any intensity, and all trees may killed by high-
intensity fire.  Even relatively cool fires may wound 
older trees and open the way to heartwood decay.  
Repeated fire at short intervals may permanently 
exclude black cottonwood.  Even so, post-fire 
regeneration may be effective and rapid in black 
cottonwood.  Thickened bark on lower portions of the 
trunk after 10-20 years affords better fire protection, 
and moist soil contributes to the survival of 
underground parts.  Trees can quickly sprout from the 
stump and roots following top-kill or damage by fire.  
Abundant production of seeds and their wide 
dispersal enable black cottonwood to rapidly colonize 
large areas of moist soil after burns, which provide 
ideal conditions of maximum light and bare mineral 
soil.   
 
 
 
Collect seeds for propagation as capsules begin to 
open (late May to mid July).  Place in paper bags and 
allow them to finish opening in warm area.  They 
need to be sown within a few days of ripening. 
otherwise they may be kept viable for up to a year by 
drying and storing cold in an air-tight container.  In a 
cold frame, sow on the surface or lightly cover the 
seeds.  Plant into permanent positions either in late 
summer or the following spring, depending on

45 cm long and 1-3 cm diameter, taken during the 
dormant season and with healthy axillary buds, can 
be placed in a sheltered outdoor bed or directly into 
permanent positions.  Plant with one bud above the 
surface.  Cuttings grown in a mist-propagator also 
root easily.  Nursery- or container-grown seedlings 
and rooted cuttings establish easily and grow rapidly 
on moist well-drained soils in full sun.  Live stakes 
should be 3.5 cm diameter and 1.2 m long, stuck 
directly into ground on-site.

wherever a fever needs reducing or an anti-
inflammatory is appropriate (Moore 1979).  The bark 
is the most effective part for tea but is rather bitter. 
for this reason the leaves are often preferred.  Leaf 
buds make an excellent ointment for burns and skin 
irritations.  A wash of the bark is applied externally 
for cuts, bruises, abrasions, burns and fetid 
perspiration, as well as healing chafing sores on 
horses.  A poultice can be used for sprains, muscle 
pain, and swollen joints.   A salve can be made that 
cleanses and conditions the skin when used regularly.  
Taken internally, it is an anti-inflammatory agent, 
reduces fever, indigestion, aids coughs from colds, 
expels worms and intestinal parasites, is effective 
against scurvy, heart troubles, back pain, excessive 
menses, urinary tract infections, is a diuretic, and is 
used to prevent premature birth. 
 
The Hopi Indians of Arizona consider the 
cottonwood tree sacred and carve Kachina dolls from 
the roots of the tree. They believe the rustle of the 
wind through the quaking leaves to be the gods 
speaking to people (Strike 1994). 
 
Several California tribes used Populus roots to make 
loosely twined baskets.  The Hupa, from Northern 
California, use cottonwood roots to begin making 
twined baskets.  The Maidu and Yokuts Indians use 
cottonwood twigs in their basketry (Strike 1994). 
 
Chumash skirts were made of fibers of Populus inner 
bark.  Cordage, made from the inner bark of 
cottonwood or milkweed, held the rest of the fibers 
hanging freely. Sometimes small teardrop-shaped 
pieces of asphaltum, shell beads or Pinus seeds were 
used as weights to make the fibers hang properly.  
Wintun also used Populus fibers for skirts and for 
padding baby cradles.' WHERE symbol='pofr2';

structure.  Riparian ecosystem functions include the 
following: 
•  Ecological diversity. 
•  Riparian vegetation stabilizes sediment, thus 
preventing excessive soil erosion. 
•  Water quality is improved through filtration and 
trapping of sediment, nutrients and pollutants. 
•  Riparian vegetation tends to prevent the river 
from down-cutting or cutting a straight path 
(channeling), thus promoting a sinuous course, 
ground-water recharge, and maintenance of an 
elevated water table. 
Structurally complex riparian vegetation 
communities provide many different habitats and 
support a diverse array of animal species.  
Different groups of animals occupy or use the 
different layers of vegetation, and this multi-
story arrangement is often present nowhere else 
in the arid landscapes. 
•  Canopies of plants growing on streambanks 
• 
 
provide shade, cooling stream water, while roots 
stabilize and create overhanging banks, 
providing habitat for fish and other aquatic 
organisms 
Riparian habitat provides living conditions for a 
greater variety of wildlife than any other habitat type 
found in California.  Use of riparian areas by wildlife 
species is affected by diversity and volume of foliage, 
presence of water, availability of &quot.edge&quot. habitat, and 
high levels of insect populations.  Valley-foothill 
riparian habitats provide food, water migration and 
dispersal corridors, and escape, nesting and thermal 
cover for an abundance of wildlife.  About 25 percent 
of the 502 California native land mammal species 
and subspecies are largely dependent on riparian 
ecosystems.  Additionally, 55 species of mammals 
are known to use California s Central Valley riparian 
communities (Trapp et al. 1985).  At least 21 
mammal species or subspecies have been identified 
as being particularly vulnerable to loss of riparian 
habitat (Williams and Kilburn 1984).  At least 50 
amphibians and reptiles occur in lowland riparian 
systems (Brode and Bury 1985). 
 
Wildlife: California s riparian forests support a high 
diversity of breeding birds (Miller 1951).  In one 
study conducted on the Sacramento River, 147 bird 
species were recorded as nesters or winter visitants 
(Laymon 1985).  The percentage of breeding 
individuals, which are migratory, is very high in the 
cottonwood-willow habitat.  Humid conditions in the 
cottonwood-willow forest may promote more lush 
plant growth, higher invertebrate populations and. 
therefore, more available food for flycatchers, 
warblers and other migratory, insectivorous birds.  
 
 
Riparian areas support up to 10.6 times the density of 
migrant birds per hectare as adjacent non-riparian 
areas (Stevens et al. 1977).  Most of these migratory 
birds belong to the foliage insect (47%) or air insect 
(34%) foraging guilds. 
 
Grouse, quail, and other birds eat cottonwood buds 
and catkins (Martin et al. 1951).  Bark, twigs, and 
leaves are eaten by ungulates and rabbits, while 
beavers and porcupines relish the bark and wood. 
 
Since European settlement, the nesting riparian forest 
avifauna has changed significantly. Double-crested 
cormorants, great blue heron, great egret, Cooper s 
hawk, bald eagle, yellow-billed cuckoo, willow 
flycatcher, bell s vireo, warbling vireo, yellow 
warbler, and common yellow throat have been 
severely negatively impacted.  Parasitism by brown-
headed cowbirds has significantly negatively 
impacted willow flycatcher, Bell s vireo, warbling 
vireo, yellow warbler and common yellow throat.  
They burden other species with the task of incubating 
their eggs and raising their young. 
 
Fremont s cottonwood is one of several species which 
constitutes the majority of the diet of beavers (Castor 
canadensis) (Stromberg 1993).  Beavers, once a 
dominant aquatic mammal in riparian systems, have 
been significantly reduced in many riparian areas 
through trapping, shooting, in-stream flow 
reductions, and other factors.  
 
Recreation: Recreational use of the riparian zone is 
many times that of other habitats.  People are drawn 
to the cool, shady environment along flowing streams 
for camping, picnicking, hiking, birding, 
photography, hunting, and fishing.  These areas 
contain water, interesting plants and animals, shade, 
and numerous other enjoyable features in the 
otherwise arid and semiarid environments.  
 
The impact of recreational use on wildlife varies with 
the season and with the type, intensity and duration 
of use.  Construction of trails, picnic tables, and 
docks encourages recreational use and increases 
conflict with wildlife.  Recreational use may also 
reduce water quality because of proliferation of 
human wastes. 
 
Livestock: Riparian ecosystems offer water, shade, 
and food for domestic livestock.  Cattle and sheep 
congregate in riparian areas, particularly during hot 
or dry periods.  Overgrazing of domestic livestock in 
riparian areas destroys riparian ground cover, disrupts 
the reproductive cycle of cottonwood trees, 
destabilizes streambanks, and thus increases sediment 

Page 3
loads to streams.  At periods in the year when the soil 
is not too wet, the leafage, twigs and shoots of 
Fremont cottonwood are browsed by all domestic 
grazing animals and deer.  The twigs are cropped 
especially close by sheep, goats, and deer.  The 
browse rating for cottonwood is good to fair for 
goats. fair to poor for sheep and deer. poor for cattle. 
and useless for horses (Sampson et al. 1981). 
 
Restoration Concerns: Many land uses in arid 
watersheds significantly decrease or destroy 
cottonwood riparian forests.  Timber harvest often 
adversely affects flood flows, which often become 
larger and flashier and carry increased sediment.  
Buffer strips can help reduce sedimentation rates and 
flood velocities.  
 
Stream diversion for irrigation may reduce surface 
flows to a level insufficient to maintain cottonwood 
vegetation.  Ground water pumping lowers local and 
regional water tables and reduces stream flow, which 
can eliminate or weaken riparian vegetation. 
 
Runoff from hardened urban watersheds is immediate 
and intense, and sometimes actually lowers nearby 
riparian water tables as it causes rapid erosion and 
down-cutting in stream channels. 
 
Two introduced weedy riparian species that continue 
to be recommended and distributed by commercial 
plant nurseries are Russian olive (Eleagnus 
angustifolia) and tamarisk or salt cedar (Tamarix 
chinensis).  Intensive or poorly timed livestock 
grazing and dam-induced changes in flood timing and 
magnitude often favor the survival of these 
introduced species and allow them to displace native 
species.  These species are very difficult to remove 
from human-impacted landscapes and are more 
competitive than cottonwood.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Description='Willow Family (Salicaceae).  Fremont’s cottonwood 
is a native tree growing in riparian areas near 
streams, rivers and wetlands in the American 
Southwest.  Fremont s cottonwood trees range from 
12 to 35 meters in height, and trunk diameter ranges 
from 0.30 to 1.5 meters.  The bark is smooth in 
younger trees, becoming deeply furrowed with 
whitish cracked bark with age.  The leaves are 
cordate (heart-shaped) with white veins and coarse 
 
 
crenate-serrate teeth on the margins. The leaves have 
petioles 1/2 to equal the blade length, laterally 
compressed near the blade which causes the leaves to 
flutter in the wind.  These trees are dioecious, with 
flowers in drooping catkins, which are 4 to 14 cm 
long.  Cottonwoods bloom from March-April.  The 
fruit is an achene, which is attached to a silky hair, en 
masse looking like patches of cotton hanging from 
the limbs, thus the name cottonwood.  The seeds are 
wind dispersed.

throughout California and is most abundant in the 
San Joaquin and Sacramento Valleys. According to 
Hickman (1993), cottonwood occurs in alluvial 
bottomlands and streamsides at elevations less than 
2000 m.

forests of lower terrace deposits and stabilized gravel 
bars. Cottonwoods are found near water.  They 
require a bare gravel or sand substrate with adequate

Cottonwoods grow very rapidly when their roots are 
in contact with the permanent water table. they can 
grow as much as 12 to 18 feet in 3 years. 
 
In California, common associates are valley oak 
(Quercus lobata), interior live oak (Quercus 
wislizenii), California walnut (Juglans hindsii), and 
California sycamore (Platanus racemosa). Box elder 
(Acer negundo),  Oregon ash (Fraxinus latifolia), 
alder (Alnus rhombifolia), and willow (Salix 
gooddingii, S. exigua, S. lasiandra, and S. laevigata) 
are particularly prevalent in the subcanopy.  
Understory species are mostly shrubs, including 
elderberry (Sambucus mexicana), buttonbush 
(Cephalanthus occidentalis), blackberry (Rubus spp), 
and California rose (Rosa californica).  Lianas such 
as poison oak (Rhus diversiloba ) and California 
grape (Vitis californica are) are a dominant feature.  
Herbaceous vegetation is 1% cover except in 
openings where tall forbs may occur. 
 
Typically, in California, cottonwoods and willows 
predominate on the immediate stream banks, whereas 
valley oaks are spread irregularly over the natural 
levees farther away from the river.  In other parts of 
the American west, temporal gradients occur within a 

Page 4
location in the riparian zone.  Early pioneer 
communities such as cottonwood/willow give way to 
late successional communities such as mesquite or 
sagebrush, often a consequence of sediment 
accumulation (Patten 1998).  Many similarities 
among western riparian ecosystems exist because 
several dominant genera (e.g. Populus and Salix spp.) 
are common throughout the West, and many 
geomorphic and hydrologic processes that influence 
riparian establishment are similar.  
 
Western riparian ecosystems have been greatly 
altered by human activity.  Riparian forests have been 
reduced to fragmented, discontinuous patches 
because of human intervention.  For example, 
estimates are that 70 - 90 percent of the natural 
riparian ecosystems in the U.S. have been lost to 
human activities (Warner 1979).  Regional losses in 
these ecosystems have been estimated to exceed 98% 
in the Sacramento Valley in California (Smith 1977) 
and 95% in Arizona (Warner 1979).  Many factors 
have contributed to these resource losses, including 
the following: natural resource use. urbanization. 
alteration of stream flows through dam construction 
and ground-water withdrawal. modification of biotic 
conditions through grazing, agriculture, and 
introduction of non-native species. and alteration 
within watersheds (Patten 1998).

restoration has been used to create a functioning and

functioning riparian habitat that not only provides 
habitat for a complete assemblage of riparian species, 
but which is also capable of long-term regeneration 
and recovery following natural disturbances (Baird 
1989).  Careful design, monitoring, and adaptive 
management are key components to successful 
restoration.  The structure and dynamics of the plant

Live Plant Collections: Fremont s cottonwood is a 
pioneer or colonizing species and a prolific seed 
producer (Stromberg 1993).  Fremont s cottonwood 
propagates primarily from seed rather than asexually.  
Cottonwood can also sprout shoots from lateral buds 
when the apical meristem is prostrated by 
floodwaters, snapped off in high winds, or pruned by 
beaver, deer, or other wildlife. 
 
Flooding is the primary disturbance in Fremont s 
cottonwood forests.  Seed germination and tree 
 
 
establishment coincides with flood events.  Fremont s 
cottonwood seed germinates only during spring and 
early summer.  This seasonal restriction is due to: 1) 
early spring seed dispersal. 2) short periods (1 to 5 
weeks) of seed viability. and 3) rapid seed 
germination (Shafroth et al. 1998).  These traits help 
synchronize germination with high stream flows in 
spring.  Moist soil is necessary for both germination 
and establishment of Fremont s cottonwood. 
 
During this century most of the major rivers in the 
West were dammed.  The presence of these dams 
changed riparian habits in ways unfavorable to 
cottonwood regeneration.  In particular, the dams 
altered the timing and volume of water flowing 
through riparian areas.  The dams reduce floodplain 
inundation during spring, and spring flooding is 
necessary for cottonwood regeneration. 
 
Spring over-bank flows or capillary wetting of the 
soil surface in areas with shallow water tables, 
moistens the soil which is necessary for Fremont s 
cottonwood establishment.  A number of studies have 
related components of the reproductive cycle of 
Populus species to floodplain site conditions 
produced by stream flow and associated fluvial 
processes.  In particular, components of the annual 
pattern of stream flow, or annual hydrograph, are 
associated with specific stages of Populus seedling 
emergence and growth.  These include the following: 
1) flood flows that precede Populus seed dispersal 
produce suitable germination sites. 2) flow recessions 
following a peak expose germination sites and 
promote seedling root elongation. and 3) base flows 
supply soil moisture to meet summer and winter 
seedling water demand (Shafroth et al. 1998. 
Mahoney et al. 1998).  The combination of root 
growth and capillary fringe defines the successful 
recruitment band for seedling establishment, which is 
usually from about 0.6 to 2 m in elevation above the 
late summer stream stage (Mahoney et al. 1998).  The 
rate of stream stage decline is also critical for 
seedling survival and should not exceed 2.5 cm per 
day .  
 
Cottonwoods grow rapidly and can reach 
medium/large tree height in about 20 to 25 years.  
Cottonwood forests could occur as rapidly as 25 - 30 
year (Grenfell 1988). Shrubby riparian willow 
thickets may last 15 to 20 years before being 
overtopped and shaded out by cottonwoods.  
Cottonwood or willow tree habitats close to river 
channels that receive a good silt infusion, without 
major disruptive flows, tend to be self- perpetuating.

Cottonwood is susceptible to mistletoe.  In certain 
instances cottonwood can be invasive. Its shallow 
root system can disrupt sidewalks or pavement.  
 
Artificial Establishment: Fremont s cottonwood 
establishment from seed is difficult and seldom used.  
Fremont s cottonwood propagation is possible from 
hardwood, root cuttings and through tissue culture 
(Pope et al. 1990).  Fremont s cottonwood 
establishment from transplanted containerized 
saplings is costly and risky unless the saplings are 
irrigated.  The NRCS Los Lunas Plant Materials 
Center, in cooperation with the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service, developed a pole planting technique 
for establishing Fremont s cottonwood (USDA, 
NRCSa).  We reprint this procedure below. 
 
“Trial planting on well adapted sites indicate more 
that 80% survival of cottonwood and willow poles 
when dormant poles are cut and planted between 
November and February. 
 
It is essential to monitor the water tables at proposed 
planting sites for at least one year before planting.  
Poles planted where the water table fluctuates widely 
will have lower survival rates than those planted 
where water table is relatively stable.  If groundwater 
monitoring shows the water level will drop more than 
3 feet during the growing season (May-October), 
another site should be selected.  Monitoring of 
observation wells for at least one calendar year 
before planting will allow better planting depth to 
ensure establishment.  
 
Salt cedar (Tamarix chinensis) and Arundo donax 
will need to be controlled before poles are planted.  
However, young cottonwoods and willows can grow 
successfully in quite small openings in stands of salt 
cedar.  Study of natural stands suggest they will 
eventually shade out the salt cedar.&quot. 
 
In six riparian restoration projects carried out in 
California, competition from exotic weed species was 
a key factor in mortality and site failure (Baird 1989).  
With the addition of water, weeds grew so vigorously 
that plants smaller than a 5-gallon pot was out-
competed.  One way to avoid this was to remove the 
surface soil, although this has the disadvantage of 
removing nutrients, mycorrhizal fungi, bacteria, and 
insect and invertebrate populations critical to a 
healthy habitat.  They also used a cover crop of 
native wildflowers, hand-broadcast over the site to 
aid in weed control.  On wetter, heavier soils this 
does not seem to provide effective weed control. 
 
 
 
There is considerable evidence that fertilizing a 
restoration site in southern California favors exotic 
weeds over native plants (Grime and Hunt 1975. 
Grime 1978. t. John 1987 and 1988).  Inoculation 
with mycorrhizal fungi enabled seedlings of some 
species to better utilize limited supplies of both water 
and nutrients.  Baird (1989) achieved inoculation 
through large (1.2 m deep by 2.8 m wide) root balls 
of mature trees brought in from riparian sites.  
Smaller, more economical soil plugs scattered 
throughout the site serve the same purpose.  The 
number of soil plugs needed to ensure the 
establishment of soil flora is directly related to the 
distance of the restoration site from a similar, mature 
community.

survival of cottonwood riparian communities along 
the Rio Grande, resource managers need to

regeneration and survival, and control the spread of

Decadent age structures in cottonwood forest consist 
of stands composed of large old trees but few 
saplings or small trees.  Several studies have 
implicated unregulated livestock grazing as an 
important cause of decadent age structures in 
cottonwood forests (Brotherson et al. 1983. Fenner et

(1977) showed a negative correlation between 
grazing levels and Fremont s cottonwood recruitment.  
Several studies showed fewer cottonwood seedlings 
in grazed than in non-grazed areas (Crouch 1979. 
Reichenbacher 1984).  
 
Livestock grazing has widely been identified as a 
leading factor causing or contributing to degradation 
of riparian habitats in the western United States (U.S. 
General Accounting Office 1988. Chaney et al. 1990, 
Fleischner 1994, Ohmart 1996).  Livestock grazing 
can alter vegetative structure and composition of 
riparian habitat.  Overgrazing, especially by livestock 
and big game, frequently changes plant species 
composition and growth form, density of stands, 
vigor, seed production of plants, and insect 
production.  Bull and Slovlin (1982) attributed to 
livestock grazing the paucity of deciduous woody 
vegetation that was required by some bird species 
along Oregon streams. 
 
Schulz and Leininger (1991) found that bird species 
are differentially affected by cattle grazing in riparian 
areas.  Livestock grazing causes the replacement of 
bird and mammal species requiring the vertical 

Page 6
vegetation structure of riparian habitat to species, 
which are ubiquitous in their habitat preferences.  
Previous heavy cattle grazing changed the bird and 
small mammal community composition through 
reduction of shrub and herbaceous cover. 
 
Riparian zones can be managed for non-game species 
richness by maintaining high structural diversity of 
vegetation.  Species that are sensitive to grazing 
pressure should be monitored as indicators of habitat 
change.  Johnson (1985) pointed out the need to 
coordinate range and wildlife habitat management to 
ensure the existence of sensitive wildlife species that 
are negatively impacted by livestock grazing. Woody 
plant species increase rapidly when riparian areas are 
protected from livestock grazing.  The woody 
structural component of the vegetation is essential for 
wildlife species that are obligate inhabitants of 
riparian habitat, and in providing hiding cover and 
stabilizing streambanks for fish habitat. 
 
Slovlin (1984) recommended a 5-year rest from cattle 
grazing to re-establish healthy stands of riparian 
vegetation such as cottonwood and willows.  Siekert 
et al. (1985) reported that spring grazing showed no 
significant changes in channel morphology, whereas 
summer and fall grazing did.  However, even with 
limited seasonal grazing, all tree seedling would be 
eliminated.  Marlow and Pogacnik (1985) 
recommended fencing riparian habitat, rest-rotation, 
light grazing (&lt.20% forage removal), and grazing 
after streambanks have dried to 10% moisture.

Conservation: Quaking aspen is valued for its white 
bark and brilliant fall color, especially when 
clustered.  The species been widely used in 
landscaping but is best in sites away from structures 
that might be damaged by the aggressive roots.  The 
trees provide good visual screening and noise 
abatement.   
 
Aspen stands are good firebreaks, often dropping 
crown fires in conifer stands to the ground when they 
reach aspens and even sometimes extinguishing the 
fire because of the small amount of flammable 
accumulation.  They allow more ground water 
recharge than do conifer forests and they also play a 
significant role in protecting against soil erosion.   
They have been used in restoration of riparian 
habitats.   
 
Wildlife: Young quaking aspen provides food and 
habitat for a variety of wildlife: black bear, deer, 
beaver, porcupine, elk, moose, ruffed grouse and 
many smaller birds and animals, including small 
mammals such as mice, voles, shrews, chipmunks, 
and rabbits.  Bark, buds, new sprouts, twigs from the 
tops of fallen or logged trees, and fallen leaves all are 
wildlife foods.   
 
Ethnobotanic: Native Americans used Populus bark 
(including aspen) as a food source.  They cut the 
inner bark into strips, dried and ground it into meal to 
be mixed with other starches for bread or mush.  
Catkins were eaten raw, and the cambium was eaten 
raw or in a soup.

shrinkage (see Wheeler 2000) and is used for pallets, 
boxes, veneer, and plywood.  Higher grades are used 
for other solid wood products, such as paneling, 
furniture components, and flooring.  The wood 
characteristics make it useful in miscellaneous 
products, including excelsior, animal bedding, 
matchsticks, toys, beehives, tongue depressors, 
spoons, and ice cream sticks.  It makes good 
playground structures because the surface does not 
splinter, although the wood warps and susceptible to

Variation within the species: Considerable genetic 
and morphological variation exists over the range of 
quaking aspen.  A number of species and varieties 
have been described but none are currently 
recognized.  Entire stands are often produced as a 
single clone from root sprouts – this sometimes easily 
observable on a single mountainside in different 
timing in leaf appearance or in different hues and 
timing of fall coloration.  Distinctively large triploid 
trees are sometimes found.   
 
Quaking aspen hybridizes naturally with bigtooth 
aspen (Populus grandidentata), narrowleaf 
cottonwood (P. angustifolia), curly poplar (P. 
canescens), balsam poplar (P. balsamifera), eastern 
cottonwood (P. deltoides), and white poplar (Populus 
alba, a naturalized European species), and hybrids 
with black cottonwood (P. trichocarpa) occur rarely 
in Alaska.  Quaking aspen, bigtooth aspen, European 
aspen (P. tremula), and three Asian species are 
closely related and sometimes classed together as a 
single, circumglobal superspecies (see Peterson and 
Peterson 1992).

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Distribution TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Distribution='Quaking aspen is the most widely distributed tree 
species in North America.  It grows from Alaska 
across the Northwest Territories to Quebec and 
Newfoundland, south to West Virginia and Virginia, 
and in all of the western North America US states 
(except Oklahoma and Kansas) --  in all Canadian 
provinces and all but 13 US states (absent from the 
Southeast).  It occurs in both the eastern and western 
sierras of Mexico, into the south-central part of the 
country.  Outside of the main range, it is represented 
by a huge number of disjunct populations.   For

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Adaptation TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Adaptation='Quaking aspen occurs in a wide variety of habitats 
(including soil type and moisture conditions) and at a 
great range of elevation, matching its extensive 
geographic range.  It characteristically forms pure 
stands or mixed stands with bigtooth aspen, but it 
occurs with scrub oaks and sagebrush at lower 
elevations and as a prostrate form above timberline 
and exists as a dominant species in many 
communities at mid elevations.  It is a shade-
intolerant, disturbed site species and is quickly 
replaced in succession by more tolerant species.   
 
Some trees are self-pruning, dropping numerous 
small twigs with excess fall foliage and returning 
nutrients to the soil.  Leaves decay relatively rapidly, 
and a characteristic &quot.aspen soil,&quot. with a higher pH 
than on conifer-dominated soils, develops on sites 
that have supported aspen for a number of 
generations.    
 
Flowering occurs March–April (East) or May–June 
(West), before the leaves appear and fruiting in May–
June (–July), often before the leaves are fully 
expanded.  Temperatures above 12° C for about 6 
days apparently trigger flowering.  Female trees 
generally flower and leaf out before male trees.   
 
' WHERE symbol='potr5';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Quaking aspen commonly establishes from seed in 
Alaska, northern Canada, and eastern North America.  
Seedling establishment is less common in the West 
but occurs there in moist sites such as kettles and 
other topographic depressions, seeps, springs, lake 
margins, and burnt-out riparian zones.  Drought stress 
kills seedlings, as does standing water.      
 
Young trees first flower at 2-3 years but production 
of large seed crops begins at about 10-20 years. 
maximum seed production occurs at 50-70 years.  
Heavy seed crops are produced at 4-5-year intervals.  
Seeds are wind-dispersed for distances of 500 meters 
to several kilometers.   
 
Germination generally begins nearly immediately 
after moisture is received and can occur across a 
broad temperature range, with optimal germination at 
15-25° C.  Surface placement or a very shallow depth 
of burial on exposed mineral soil (such as burned or 
scarified sites) apparently provide the best 
environment for germination.  Continuous moisture is 
required.   
 
Asexual reproduction and clones  
Reproduction of quaking aspen is primarily by root 
sprouts, and extensive clones of root-interconnected 

Page 3
trees are characteristic of the species.  Most root 
sprouts develop within 10 meters of the parent stem, 
although some are produced at 30 meters or more.  
They develop from roots within 2-10 centimeters of 
the surface.  Growth in primordia and buds is 
suppressed by apical dominance but resumes after 
stems are top-killed by fire, harvest or wind-
breakage, or after defoliation and many thousands of 
sprouts per acre may be produced.  Removal of the 
above-ground plant portion in June or July after 
maximum auxin production (the chemical agent of 
apical dominance) results in fewer suckers than top-
removal during the dormant season.  Sprouts 
produced in a closed stand usually die unless in a 
canopy gap.  Saplings may begin producing root 
sprouts at 1 year of age.    
 
Stands of quaking aspen may consist of a single clone 
or represent a mosaic of different clones.  Even in a 
small area, wide variation in genetic traits exists 
between clones – differences may be seen in leaf 
shape and size, bark colour and texture, branching 
habit, resistance to disease and insect attack, sexual 
expression, growth rate, and phenology.  The most 
conspicuous differences may be in the timing of 
spring leaf flush and in autumn leaf coloration.    
 
The staminate-pistillate ratio of clones is 1:1 in most 
localities, but in the eastern US staminate trees may 
outnumber pistillate ones by 3:1.  Some clones 
alternate between staminate and pistillate forms in 
different years or produce combinations of perfect, 
staminate, and pistillate flowers.   
 
Individual trees of quaking aspen are short-lived 
(maximum age in the Great Lakes states is 50–60 
years, up to 150 years in the West).  Stands may be 
even-aged (after a single top-kill event) or only 
broadly even-aged (from sprouting of a gradually 
deteriorating stand).  The clones are much older:  
many in the Rocky Mountain and Great Basin 
regions are at least 8000 years old, persisting since 
the last glacial retreat.  A male clone in the Wasatch 
Mountains of Utah occupies 17.2 acres (43 ha) and 
has more than 47,000 stems – this clone is estimated 
to be 1 million years old and may be the world s most 
massive known organism.  Clones east of the Rocky 
Mountains usually cover no more than a few acres.   
 
' WHERE symbol='potr5';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='The thin, soft bark of quaking aspen makes it 
susceptible to many diseases and insect infestations 
as well as mechanical and fire damage.  Fires may 
kill trees or cause basal scars that serve as entry 
points for wood-rotting fungi, which are common in 
older stands.  The wood decays easily.  Fires may 
 
 
also kill surface roots that could reduce sucker 
regeneration.   
 
The poplar borer beetle, one of the most common 
wood borers of aspen, weakens trees by boring 
galleries in the trunk near the lower portion of the 
crown.  Outbreaks of forest tent caterpillar may last 
4-5 years and result in serious defoliation -- cold 
weather in the spring shortly after the eggs hatch and 
above-average fall temperatures can cause a rapid 
decline in caterpillar populations by killing eggs and 
larvae.  Overgrazing by livestock or big-game 
animals disturbs roots and compacts soil, limiting 
sucker formation.  Heavy grazing of young sucker 
stands by cattle for three years in a row may destroy 
them.   
 
Quaking aspen can be propagated by seed, following 
cold stratification.  Germination of fresh seed may be 
80-95%, but viability lasts only 2-4 weeks under 
favorable natural conditions (low temperature and 
humidity).  Seeds dried for 3 days and stored at cool 
temperatures may retain good viability for up to a 
year.    
 
The species roots poorly from woody stem cuttings, 
but newly initiated (softwood) shoots can usually be 
induced to root by dipping in IBA (indolebutyric 
acid) or other commercially available rooting 
powders.  A more preferred method uses root sprouts.  
Collect dormant lateral roots in early spring -- plant 
root cuttings 1-2 in diameter and 3-5 centimeters long 
in vermiculite and place in the greenhouse for 6 
weeks.  Excise the young sucker shoots and root in 
perlite/vermiculite (2-3 weeks, using IBA), misting 
frequently.  Transplant the developing plants to 
peat/vermiculite mix and grow at 15-25º C.  Or, the 
root cuttings may be planted directly into the perlite 
mix, with the top of the cutting just below the media 
surface.

(Gilmore 1977, Kindscher 1992).  They bound 
together the twigs of the wild plum and made them 
into a broom.  The Cheyenne mixed the crushed  
 
fruits of the wild plum with salt to treat mouth 
disease (Hart 1981).  They also crushed and boiled 
the small rootlets and the bark of older wild plum 
with the roots of the scarlet thorn (Crataegus 
chrysocarpa) as a diarrhea remedy (Youngken 1925).  
The Mesquakies used the root bark of the wild plum 
to cure canker sores around the mouth (Smith 1928).  
 
The Teton Dakota used the sprouts or young growth 
of the wild plum as a wand in the “waunyampi” 
ceremony (Gilmore 1977).  This is an offering or 
form of prayer, consisting of a wand made from a 
peeled and painted wild plum sprout.  The 
“waunyampi” ceremony is usually offered with 
prayers for the sick.  
 
The various species of wild plum are astringent and 
sedative, and the bark is a tonic (Smythe 1901).  The 
roots and bark contain a bitter substance as well as a 
substance called phloretin, which is an active agent 
against gram positive and negative bacteria (Lewis 
and Elvin-Lewis 1977). 
 
Wildlife: Wild plums are eaten by turkey, black bear, 
and wolves (Thwaites 1904).  Foxes, black-headed 
grosbeaks, and ring-tailed cats utilize wild plums 
(Martin et al. 1951).  Plum thickets often furnish 
valuable protective shelter. 
 
Conservation: Wild plums have been recommended 
for their drought resistance and widely planted in 
shelter belts in the western Great Plains (Jerry Kaiser 
pers. comm. 1999).  They also make good wildlife 
habitat and are effective in erosion control because 
their roots hold the soil.  Their thorny branches catch 
tumbleweeds, leaves, and other plant materials, 
which, when windstorms occur during times of 
drought, provide an effective means of slowing wind 
erosion of soil.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Adaptation: Wild plum grows in prairies, woodlands, 
pastures, and along roadsides and riverbanks. 
 
Wild plums can be planted from seed and they are 
relatively easy to transplant.  Plant in well drained 
soil. wild plum tolerates shade.  Flowering occurs in 
April and May and fruit ripens from August to 
September.  The plant has fruit every year.  
 
Propagation from Cuttings: Prunus americana 
cuttings are not easy to root.  Hardwood cuttings 
taken in late January have been rooted.  Hardwood 
cuttings are those made of matured, dormant 
hardwood after leaves have abscised and before new 
shoots emerge in the spring.  Material should be 
taken from healthy, moderately vigorous stock plants 
grown in full sunlight.  Central and basal portions 
(not the tip) of a shoot make the best cuttings.  
Cuttings vary from 10 to 76 cm (4 to 30 in).  Ensure 
that at least two nodes are included in the cutting. the 
basal cut is just below a node and the top cut is 1.3 to 
2.5 cm (0.5-1 in) above a node. 
 
It is important that hardwood cuttings not dry out 
during handling and storage.  Dip bases of hardwood 
cuttings with IBA at 20,000 ppm liquid formulation 
to promote rooting.  Alternatively, treat with 2% IBA 
talc.  This will promote rooting on both suckers and 
stem cuttings.  Dip the cuttings into root promoting 
hormone, IBA at 2000 ppm, for a few seconds, then 
keep in the dark at temperatures of 10º (50ºF).  Plant 
 
 
the cuttings in open ground in prepared holes with 
good potting soil.  Firm the soil around the cuttings 
and water.  To ensure survival of cuttings through the 
following winter in cold climates, the potted cuttings 
should be kept in heated cold frames or poly-houses 
to hold the temperature between 0-7°C (32-45°F).  
Rooted cuttings that had shoot growth in the fall, but 
were not given nitrogen, had the best over-winter 
survival in a cold frame with microfoam. 
Propagation from Seed: Harvest the fruit in the 
summer when ripe (the fruit turns dark purple), 
usually in August.  Remove the pulp or fruit from the 
seed.  Seeds can be extracted by maceration and 
recovered by flotation.  Put the seed in a 50ºF cooler 
over the winter.  For prolonged storage, seeds must 
be air dried and stored in sealed containers at cold 
temperatures.  The seeds can also be planted outdoors 
in the fall so they are naturally “cold stratified.”  
Natural germination occurs predominantly in the first 
or second year after seedfall, depending on the year. 
 
If sowing seed in the fall, it is important to sow early 
enough so seeds can pre-chill before seedbeds freeze.  
This can be overcome by mulching the seedbeds.  
Seedlings reach suitable size for transplanting in one 
to two years.  Cold stratifying up to 6 months in a 
moist environment can break seed dormancy.  Wild 
plum seeds have fairly low germination.  There are 
6.5 seeds per gram.

BITTER CHERRY 
Prunus emarginata (Dougl. ex 
Hook.) D. Dietr. 
Plant Symbol = PREM 
 
Contributed by: USDA NRCS National Plant Data 
Center 
 
Wildlife: Prunus emarginata is a valuable species for 
elk, mule deer, and black bears.  The fruits are eaten 
by small mammals, rodents, and various birds.  This 
species is preferred by sheep and cattle. 
 
Agroforestry: Bitter cherry is used in forested riparian 
buffers to help reduce stream bank erosion, protect 
aquatic environments, enhance wildlife, and increase 
biodiversity.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_='Description 
General: Bitter cherry (Prunus emarginata) is a 
native, deciduous shrub, four to twelve feet high, or 
sometimes a small tree up to thirty feet high 
(McMinn 1939).  The leaves are oblong to oval, fine 
toothed, and rounded at the tip.  The flowers are 
fragrant, blooming between April and May, in 
clusters of five to twelve.  The bark has a generally 
smooth dark brown surface marked by horizontal 
light gray interrupted hands and by rows of oblong 
orange colored lenticels (Sargent 1961). 
 
Distribution: Bitter cherry often forms extensive 
thickets on moist slopes and along stream banks in 
the transition and Canadian life zones in the coast 
ranges, the mountains of southern California and in 
the Sierra Nevada (McMinn 1939).  It extends 
northward to Idaho and British Columbia and 
eastward to Nevada and Arizona (Ibid.).  For current 
distribution, please consult the Plant profile page for 
this species on the PLANTS Web site.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_ TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_='Adaptation 
Prunus emarginata is frequently abundant in very 
dense. uniform stands, on steep, rocky slopes, and 
can be found along valley bottoms next to streams 
(Mozingo 1987).  It establishes easily in disturbed 
moist areas and prefers open sandy or gravelly sites.  
This species succeeds in full sun or partial shade but 
grows best in a sunny position.  Bitter cherry does not 
tolerate much shade competition from other trees.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_='Uses 
Ethnobotanic: The edible fruits are bitter and best 
used in jams.  A green and dark gray dye was 
obtained from the fruits and leaves.  The bark was 
used for making baskets that were watertight and 
resist decay (Moerman 1998).  The thin outer bark 
was used to make mats, ropes, arrows, and as an 
ornament on bows (Ibid.). 
 
Several native North American tribes used bitter 
cherry to treat a variety of complaints.  An infusion 
of the bark was used in the treatment of tuberculosis 
(Moerman 1998).  A decoction of the root and inner 
bark was taken daily as a treatment for heart troubles 
(Ibid.).  An infusion of the bark, combined with crab 
apple (Malus spp.), was used as a cure all tonics in 
treating colds and various other ailments (Ibid.).  An 
infusion of this species’ rotten wood was used as a 
contraceptive.

(Heuser 1997).  It is important to protect the seeds 
from mice or any seed-eating creatures.  This species 
requires a period of two to three months cold 
stratification.  The seeds can be slow to germinate, 
sometimes taking up to eighteen months.  When the 
seedlings are large enough to handle, they can be 
placed into individual pots.  Grow seedlings in an 
open frame or greenhouse their first winter and plant 
into their permanent positions in late spring or early 
summer of the following year. 
 
Propagation from Softwood Cuttings: Cuttings 
should be done in the spring or early summer in the 
early morning.  Take cuttings about five to ten 
centimeters long, just above the node.  Put cuttings in 
plastic bags to prevent moisture loss (Heuser 1997).  
They must not be allowed to wilt. Trim the cuttings 
below the lowest node to remove the lower leaves 
leaving three or four at the tip (Ibid.).  A rooting 
hormone maybe applied to improve rooting before 
planting.  Insert the cuttings in the rooting medium 
up to half their length so the leaves don’t touch each 
other.  The cuttings root in two to three weeks, after 
which they can be potted (Ibid.).

Description 
General: Legume Family (Leguminosae).  Honey 
mesquite can be a shrub or tree ranging from 4 to 6 m 
tall.  One or two stout spines are found at the nodes.  
The leaves are alternate, bipinnate, and have petioles.  
There are usually one paired division (pinnae) per 
leaf and 6 to 15 leaflets per pinna.  The leaflets are 15 
to 62 mm long and smooth.  The flowers are in 
axillary spikes that are 7 to 9 cm long.  The flowers 
are yellow in color.  The calyx has a shallow, cup-
like shape.  Each flower has 10 stamens and white 
woolly ovaries.  The legumes are straight and nearly 
as thick as they are broad (7-20 cm long).  The 
legumes are reddish-brown in color and constricted 
between seeds.  The seeds are 6 to 6.5 mm long and 
brownish in color.   
 
Distribution: For current distribution, please consult 
the Plant Profile page for this species on the

harpoon lines, to bundle reeds, and make carrying 
nets by the Seri of northwestern Mexico.  The trunk 
was made into wooden mortars and the smaller 
branches were used for bow making.  Sometimes 
arrow foreshafts were of mesquite wood.  Mesquite 
made excellent firewood for cooking, baking pottery, 
and warmth and mesquite bark was good for 
kindling.  Large branches were used for construction 
such as posts for houses and rafters.  The Seri use 
mesquite to make the ribs of wooden boats.  Thorns 
were used as a needle in puncturing the skin for 
tattoos.  Mesquite gum was used to glue foreshafts of 
arrows and adhere baskets to mortars.  Tribes of the 
southwest used the gum secreted from the bark to 
mend pottery, make candy, and furnish a black dye.  
 
Wildlife: Honey mesquite is an important tree to 
wildlife.  The seeds are eaten by jack rabbits, Gambel 
quail, songbirds, various small mammal, and 
domestic livestock.  Western chipmunks, ground 
squirrels, pocket mice, and various species of 
kangaroo and wood rats consume the foliage.  
Different birds also nest in the tree s canopy.

Ethnobotanic: Many parts of honey mesquite were 
useful to indigenous groups of California, the 
Southwest and northern Mexico, and some of these 
uses are still enacted today.  The Cahuilla picked the 
flowers of honey mesquite in the spring and roasted 
them in a pit of heated stones, after which they were 
formed into balls and eaten.  The blossoms were also 
utilized in making a tea.  Many tribes in southern 
California and the Southwest including the Timbisha 
Shoshone, Nevada and Utah Southern Paiute, 
Kawaiisu, Cahuilla, Panamint, Luiseno, Pima, Yuma, 
and Commanche ate the edible pods.  The seeds 
made into a fermented pinole was a favorite 
intoxicating drink.  The Cahuilla gathered the pods in 
two stages, green or ripe.  The green pods were 
pounded into a juicy pulp and consumed as a summer 
beverage.  The ripe pods were eaten without any 
processing or were pounded into a flour in a mortar 
and then placed in a vessel, dampened with water, 
and left for 24 hours to harden.  The meal was 
formed into cakes and eaten dry, made into a mush, 
or mixed with water for a beverage.

upset the stomach if too much is consumed.  The thin 
pulp was welcome moisture for thirsty hunters.   The 
juice from the fruits was fermented and drunk.  The 
kernels within the large pits were particularly valued 
for food by many Native Californians.  In the past, 
for some tribes, the kernels within these wild cherry 
pits were second only to acorns in importance.  The 
fruit was usually hand picked from the trees. The 
fruits that were not consumed fresh were allowed to 
rot or sometimes placed in warm water in order to 
facilitate removal of pit.  The pits were then rubbed 
to remove any remaining pulp and skin before being 
spread out in the sun to dry.   When dry, the pits were 
cracked with a stone and the kernels removed.  The 
kernels contain hydrocyanic acid, a bitter tasting 
poisonous compound, which was removed by a 
leaching process prior to cooking.  The kernels, either 
left whole or pounded into a meal, were then leached 
in several changes of cold or warm water.  The 
ground meal was used as a base for soup and made 
into tortilla or tamale-like foods.   The whole kernels 
reportedly took several hours to cook.  Sometimes the 
kernels were roasted overnight in a grass-lined pit 
(Bocek 1984).   After cooking the kernels were 
mashed and made into cakes or balls. The finished 
cakes were served with meat or dipped into pinole.  
For an in-depth discussion of what is recorded about 
the differing preparations of islay by several Native 
Californian groups, see Timbrook (1982).  Prepared 
islay was considered a delicacy that was used for 
ceremonial offerings as well as offered as a 
welcoming gift for visitors.    
 
The Diegueño and the Cahuilla are among the tribes 
that treated colds and coughs with infusions made 
from hollyleaf cherry bark and roots (Almstedt 1977, 
Romero 1954).  During the spring and summer, while 
the sap of the tree was running the infusion was made 
from the bark.  During the winter, while the tree was 
dormant, the roots were used for the infusion.   The 
Costanoan used the wood to make bows (Bocek 
1984).  The Tipai people of Baja California are 
among the few tribes that still gather islay today.    
 
Livestock:  The pits of hollyleaf cherry are poisonous 
to most livestock.  The leaves can also contain 
varying concentrations of hydrocyanic acid, which is 
poisonous to livestock.   
 
Wildlife:  Hollyleaf cherry is an excellent tree for 
encouraging wildlife into the garden.  The flowers 
attract bees.  The fruits are relished my many bird

species and the seeds are consumed by small 
mammals.  These birds and animals also help to 
disperse the seeds away from the parent plant.  In 
addition, many bird and animal species use the plants 
for cover as well as nesting places.  Hollyleaf cherry 
is an important browse species for bighorn sheep and 
California mule deer (McMurray 1990).  This is 
because it is still available long into the dry 
California summers when most other browse items 
are gone.   
 
Other:  Hollyleaf cherry is useful to control erosion 
and has been planted on steep, hillsides that are 
susceptible to erosion (McMurray 1990).  Hollyleaf 
cherry has been used to make holiday wreaths and 
decorations, especially in combination with the red-
berried branches of toyon (Heteromeles arbutifolia), 
another native California plant that occurs in the 
same plant community.

General:  Rose family (Rosaceae).  Hollyleaf cherry 
is a small, evergreen shrub or tree that is native to 
California.  The plants can reach 6 to 9 meters and 
are usually as broad as they are tall.  The bark is dark 
gray and smooth.  The twigs are grayish to reddish 
brown.  The many branches bear glossy dark green 
leaves that are lighter green beneath.  The leaves 
resemble holly leaves with serrated edges and tiny 
spines.   Leaves are 16 to 120 mm in length and 
alternately arranged.  Feathery blooms of flowers 
appear from March to May.  The white flowers grow 
on a raceme of several flowers with petals from 1 to 3 
mm long.   The stems of the individual flowers vary 
from 1 to 5 mm long.  The red to bluish-black cherry 
fruits ripen in September or October and are 12 to 
25mm in diameter.  A thin layer of sweet, fleshy pulp 
overlays a large smooth pit.   
 
Distribution: Hollyleaf cherry is native to western 
California.  It occurs in the mountains of the Coast 
Range from Napa County in the north to Baja in the 
south.  The subspecies lyonni, is a tree to 15m whose 
native range is restricted to the Channel Islands off 
the coast of southern California.   
 
For current distribution, please consult the Plant 
Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
site. 
 
 
 
Habitat: These trees and shrubs grow in the moister 
areas of dry chaparral shrublands and foothill 
woodlands at elevations below 1600 meters.  They 
are often found in canyons and on north-facing 
slopes.

devil s claw were collected in autumn, split and used 
to create black basketry designs by many tribes in 
southern California and the Southwest.  These tribes 
include the Chemehuevi, Kawaiisu, Owens Valley 
Paiute, Tubatulabal, Havasupai, Papago, and Pima.  
Because the claws are durable, they were often used 
to construct the base of baskets among the Papago 
and Pima.  The material is still gathered wild or 
plants are cultivated in home gardens by 
contemporary weavers.  The Papago used the young 
pods as food, while the Pima cracked the seeds 
between the teeth and ate them like pine-nuts.  To 
treat rheumatic pains, the Pima broke off a small 
piece of the claw and pressed it into the flesh, then 
lighted it and allowed it to burn.

the bark was ground up in a mortar, dried, and again 
pounded into a fine meal in a metate and this powder 
was applied to the wound after a few days.  The Pima 
also used a tea made from the roots of screwbean to 
regulate a woman s menstrual troubles.  A gummy 
exudate sometimes found on the bark was gathered 
and soaked in water and the Moapa Paiute used the 
resulting liquid as eyewash.  The large branches were 
used in construction such as fencing and binding for 
large granary baskets made by the Pima, and the 
Cahuilla sometimes used the smaller branches for 
bows.  The mescal cutter, a long pole that was used 
by the Cahuilla to sever agave leaves was made of 
screwbean. The root wood is good for firewood for 
cooking.   
 
Wildlife: Screwbean is an important tree to wildlife.  
The seeds are eaten by jackrabbits, Gambel quail, 
songbirds, various small mammals, and domestic 
livestock.  Western chipmunks, ground squirrels, 
pocket mice, and various species of kangaroo and 
wood rats consume the foliage. Different birds also 
nest in the tree s canopy.  The early spring growth 
also furnishes food for domestic livestock.

provided staple foods for indigenous people of 
southern California, the Great Basin and the 
Southwest and their seed pods are still highly relished 
today.  Screwbean pods were eaten by the Maricopa, 
Hualapai, Pima, Cahuilla, Luiseno, Mohave, 
Panamint and Death Valley Shoshone, the 
Chemehuevi, Ute, Gosiute, and Southern Paiute 
groups as far east as the edge of the Colorado 
Plateau.  The pods can be harvested at two different 
times, in the spring, while still green and consumed 
raw as snacks or in the late summer when the pods 
are ripe.  If collected in the late summer, traditionally 
they were placed in bedrock mortars or tree-stump 
mortars and pounded to fine flour using stone pestles.  
The meal was set out to dry and then stored in 
baskets in grass- or bark-lined pits in rock-shelters or 
caves.  Basketfuls of meal were also kept in 
indigenous homes and added to cooked agave or 
made into small cakes.  Another way to prepare the 
pods was to cook the screwbeans in pits covered with 
earth and left to stand three or four days, and then 
spread to dry.  The mass was then pounded in a 
mortar and the fine meal eaten as pinole. 
 
The plant was also important medicinally.  The Pima 
used the bark of the root of the screwbean as a 
dressing for wounds.  There were two ways to 
prepare the dressing and then these concoctions were 
applied at different times.  First, the bark was boiled

Uses 
Ethnobotanic: The pods of this mesquite provided an 
important food to the Maricopa, Pima, Haulapais, and 
other tribes of the Southwest and are still very 
important today.  The pods or the seeds alone are 
ground in a mortar or the seeds are sometimes 
parched and afterwards ground into a meal that is 
very nourishing.  This meal is eaten as is, used to 
sweeten other seed mixtures, or made into bread. 
Traditionally a drink was prepared from the beans by 
pounding them in a stone mortar, mixing cold water 
with the flour, and the product was strained and 
drank.  The black gum from the mesquite was an 
important medicine to the Pima.  It was boiled with a 
little water and applied to sore lips and gums, 
chapped fingers, and taken internally to cleanse the 
system.  Mesquite leaves were pounded and boiled 
and placed on the eyes of Pima individuals as a 
treatment for pink eye.  The Pima used black gum in 
a concoction to dye gray hair black. 
Industrial: The wood is used for fence posts and the 
heartwood takes a fine polish.  The flowers are used 
as a source of bee food in the honey industry. 
Wildlife: Mesquite is an important tree to wildlife. 
The seeds are eaten by jackrabbits, Gambel quail,

The seeds are toxic due to production of hydrocyanic 
acid in the leaves, stems and seeds.  The almond nuts 
are treated to deactivate the poisonous glycosides 
before they are put on the market.  Cases of illness 
and deaths have been traced back to eating the seeds 
of these trees.  
 
Conservation:  Chokecherry is used extensively in 
shelterbelts, windbreaks, wildlife habitat and mass 
plantings for erosion control.  Chokecherry does well 
in riparian area planting.  It provides thermal cover 
over the water and works well in stabilizing 
streambanks.  It has been used on disturbed sites such 
as mined land reclamation, highway right-of-ways 
and construction sites.  It is a good erosion control 
plant because it can form thickets and spread by 
rhizomes. 
 
Wildlife:  Chokecherry is important to many wildlife 
animals.  Birds, rabbits, hares, rodents and bears all 
seek out and eat its fruit.  It provides food, cover and 
nesting habitat for a variety of birds. Birds will also 
take advantage of its growth form for cover and 
nesting habitat.  It is used extensively by deer as a 
browse source in the winter.  The early spring 
flowers provide an important source of nectar for 
butterflies, honeybees and ants.   
 
Food:  The common name, chokecherry, came from 
the bitter and astringent taste of the fruit. The fruit 
was a staple for numerous Indian tribes across the 
North American continent, especially to tribes who 
lived on the plains and prairies.  Chokecherries were 
routinely cooked before they were eaten or dried 
thoroughly.  Both methods served to break down any 
formation of prussic acid contained in the stone pits.  
Drying chokecherries improves their taste by 
sweetening them, or at the very least, getting rid of 
the naturally occurring bitter taste.  Chokecherries 
were consumed in three ways by Indians.  The fruit 
and/or juice were eaten.   Whole cherries, including 
pulp, skin and stone, were pulverized into a pulp, 
shaped into balls and dried in the sun.  Fruit balls 
could be stored for future use.  Either boiling or 
drying the fruit will neutralize the naturally occurring 
hydrocyanic acid.  The most important use was as 
part of the recipe for pemmican, or mince-meat.  
Pemmican was made by getting a slice of dried meat 
(bison was preferred over elk, deer or antelope) and 
pounding it with a stone until it had a fine texture.  
Bone marrow and animal lard were then heated and 
mixed with the meat.  Crushed chokecherries were

then added.  Pemmican would be cached as a winter 
food.  Some form of pemmican was a mainstay for all 
plains tribes.  Chokecherry butter was made by 
cooking the mature fruit, straining out the seed and 
skins, mixing this poultice with an equal quantity of 
wild plums or crabapples and adding sugar.  The bark 
was brewed for a tea drink.  Many tribes would add 
the fruits to soups and stews as flavoring and as a 
thickening agent.  A green branch was speared 
through a meat slab while it was cooking to add spice 
to the taste. 
 
Likewise, pioneers and settlers came to realize its 
food value.  Mature fruits are still collected today and 
used to make jellies, jams, pie-fillings, syrups, sauces 
and wines. 
 
Like many plants and animals which were vital to 
their survival some tribes used parts of the 
chokecherry plant in their rituals.  A green dye was 
derived from the leaves, inner bark and immature 
fruit.  A purplish-red dye was derived from the ripe 
fruit. The Cheyenne used the limbs to make arrow 
shafts and bows.  The Crows used it for tipi stakes 
and pins.  Mountain men washed their steel traps in 
water boiled with the bark to remove the scent.  It is 
speculated many tribes planted seeds in places they 
frequented to ensure a supply of chokecherries was 
always available. 
 
Chokecherry is being promoted for planting as a 
minor crop in the prairie provinces of Canada for 
juice production.  Estimated fruit production potential 
is 15,000 pounds per acre from mature plants.  There 
is a significant research effort in Canada for 
developing fruit producing cultivars. 
 
Landscaping:  In some parts of the U.S., chokecherry 
is a popular ornamental.  Its quick growth, mature 
size, attractive white flowers in the spring and strong, 
sweet and almond-like aroma fragrance make it a 
good yard tree in urban neighborhoods.  Cultivars are 
planted for ornamentals rather than the native 
species.  All native chokecherry varieties have a great 
tendency to sucker, which can create problems in 
lawn care.  Most cultivated varieties do not have this 
suckering trait while producing more attractive 
flowers and/or larger fruit.  The fruit also attracts a 
diverse population of birds for a number of weeks.  
Chokecherries can be a component in a screen or 
noise barrier planting.  
 
Ethnobotany:  Chokecherry covered a large 
geographic range in North America, so a majority of 
tribes used it to treat a variety of health problems.  It 
 
 
was valued especially for its astringent properties and 
beneficial effect upon the respiratory system. 
 
The Arika women would drink the berry juice to stop 
post-partum hemorrhage. 
 
The Blackfeet drank berry juice for diarrhea and sore 
throats.  An infusion of the cambium layer mixed 
with Saskatoon serviceberry (Amelanchier almifolia) 
was taken as a general purge treatment and to 
lactating mothers so they could pass on the medicinal 
qualities to the nursing baby.  They also used it in an 
enema solution for their children.  Willow (Salix 
spp.) tea was used to counteract the laxative effect of 
chokecherry. 
 
The Cherokees used chokecherry in the following 
ways:  mixed chokecherry with hazel alder (Alnus 
serrulata), downy rattlesnake plantain (Goodyera 
pubescens), Canadian wildginger (Asarum 
canadense) and yellowroot (Xanthorhiza 
simplicissima) to make a blood tonic.  An infusion 
made from boiled bark was given for coughs, 
laryngitis, chills, ague, fevers and to loosen phlegm.  
Warm chokecherry tea was given to women when 
labor pains began.  The root bark is a good astringent 
and was mixed with water and used as a rinse for 
open sores and old skin ulcers.  The tree bark of 
spicebush (Lindera benzoin) and flowering dogwood 
(Cornus florida) was added to corn whiskey and used 
to treat for measles.  The fruit was boiled and eaten to 
treat for bloody bowels.  The branches and leaves 
were one of six ingredients burned in sweat lodges to 
treat for indigestion and jaundice. 
The Cheyenne would gather the immature fruit, dry it 
in the sun, pulverize it and use it as a treatment for 
diarrhea.  
 
The Paiutes made a medicinal tea from the leaves and 
twigs to treat colds and rheumatism. 
 
The Sioux chewed the dried roots and then placed 
this poultice in open wounds to stop the bleeding.  
The Sioux, Crows, Gros Ventres and others made a 
bark tea to cure stomach aches, diarrhea and 
dysentery.  The Crows also used the bark to cleanse 
sores and burns.  
 
In the 19th century medical doctors used many 
concoctions of chokecherry leaves and bark to treat a 
number of ailments.  Chokecherry bark was listed in 
the U.S. Pharmacopoeia from 1820 to 1970.  It is still 
listed as a pharmaceutical aid, a flavor agent for 
liquid medicines.  Among the health complaints 
treated were debility, hectic fever, irritative 
dyspepsia, irritability of the nervous system, fever, 

Page 3
pleurisy, whooping cough, tuberculosis, pneumonia, 
sore throats and gastrointestinal problems.  It was 
recommended as a rinse on burns, open sores, 
cankers and skin ulcers.  Pharmaceutical books at that 
time cautioned against boiling any mixture using 
chokecherry leaves or bark because it would drive off 
the medicinal properties.  The bark was used as a 
flavoring agent in many cough syrups.  In 1834, Dr. 
Proctor first identified the bark as containing prussic 
acid.   
 
In their journals, Lewis and Clark recorded that while 
camped on the upper Missouri River Captain Lewis 
became will with abdominal cramps and fever.  He 
made a tea from chokecherry twigs and was well the 
next day. 
 
Modern medicinal research shows in small dosages 
hydrocyanic acid can stimulate respiration, improve 
digestion and gives a false sense of well-being.  
Some cancer research involving hydrocyanic acid is 
being conducted.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Description='General: Rose Family (Rosaceae).  Chokecherry is a 
native, perennial, deciduous, woody, thicket-forming 
large erect shrub or small tree. It rarely reaches a 
height of over 30 feet.  The crown is irregular and 
from 10 to 20 feet wide when mature.  The stems are 
numerous and slender.  Reproduction can either be by 
seed or root rhizomes. 
 
Leaves are dark green and glossy above and paler 
beneath.  They are alternate, simple, glabrous, oval to 
broadly elliptic in shape, 1 to 4 inches long, and 3/4 
to 2 inches wide.  The margins are toothed with 
closely-spaced sharp teeth pointing outward forming 
a serrated edge.  They turn yellow in autumn. 
 
The bark of young trees may vary from gray to a 
reddish brown.  As it ages the bark turns darker, into 
brownish-black and becomes noticeably furrowed.  
The bark is distinctly marked by horizontal rows of 
raised air pores (lenticels).  With maturation the 
lenticels develop into shallow grooves.  
 
It has perfect flowers which are aromatic and 
arranged in cylindrical racemes 3 to 6 inches long.  
The racemes always grow on the current year s leafy 
twig growth.  Individual flowers are perfect, 1/4 to 
3/8 inch in diameter with 5 white petals.  The flowers 
start appearing before the leaves are fully developed.  
Flowers may appear from April to July and fruits 
form a couple of months later.    
 
The fruits are spherical drupes (fleshy fruit with a 
stone in the center), globose, 1/4 to 3/8 inch in 
diameter.  Small ripe cherries range in color from 
dark red or purple to almost black.  There are from 
3,000 to 5,000 seeds per pound.  
 
The roots are a network of rhizomes.  Deep root 
systems grow at irregular intervals along the length 
of the rhizomes.  Rhizomes can extend beyond the 
drip zone, up to 35 feet away from the base of the 
tree.  Rhizomes grow up to 3/4 inch in diameter. 
 
There are three recognized varieties of Prunus 
virginiana.  The variety demissa is commonly called 
western chokecherry.  It produces dark red fruit.  The 
variety melanocarpa produces black fruit.  The 
variety virginiana produces crimson to deep red fruit. 
This variety can be found in two forms, one with red 
and one with white fruit. 
 
Habitat: Chokecherry is found in a large geographic 
area and it grows abundantly in many habitat types 
and plant associations.  It may be found in thin 
stands, as dense thickets or individually in open 

Page 4
forest clearings.  It prefers direct sunlight and is not 
an understory species of boreal forests. 
 
Chokecherry occurs naturally in a wide range of soil 
types and textures.  Soils supporting chokecherry 
vary considerably, from abandoned construction 
sites, with almost no soil depth or fertility, to deep 
virgin grasslands, with deep profiles and a high level 
of nutrients.  Soil textures range from silt to sandy 
loam, it does not do well on heavy clay soils.  Soil 
pH can vary from 5.2 (mildly acid) to 8.4 
(moderately alkaline) without any adverse effect 
upon growth.  Precipitation ranges from 13 to 65 
inches annually.  Sites range from low to mostly mid-
elevation, although it also occurs from 8,000 to 
10,000 feet in Idaho, Nevada and Utah.  It is widely 
adaptable to temperature extremes.  It is found in 
USDA hardiness zones 2 to 7 naturally.  If planted, 
chokecherry will grow into zone 10.  The four major 
limiting factors in its habitat are that it is intolerant of 
shade, poor drainage, frequent flooding and soils with 
a large amount of clay.   
 
Many wildlife animals eat the fruit and distribute it.  
Birds are by far the most common carrier of the 
seeds.  As a consequence it grows abundantly on 
places where birds rest, like along roadsides, fences, 
hedgerows, riparian margins and forest clearings. 
Chokecherry is well adapted to fire disturbance.  It 
can be top-killed by fire, but re-sprouts readily from 
root crowns and rhizomes.  Seed germination is 
apparently improved with heat treatment, suggesting 
a further adaptation to fire.

months, then placed about 1/2 inch deep.  Saplings 
are not tolerant of weedy competition for 2 to 3 years 
after planting.  Use of weed barrier mat, a strict 
cultivation regime, or proper herbicide treatment is 
necessary if a successful planting is to occur.  Check 
with your local NRCS Field Office to determine if 
chokecherry is adapted to your area or soils before 
planting any trees.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_EnvironmentalConcerns='The leaves, bark, stem, and stone (seed pit) of 
chokecherry are all toxic.  It is potentially poisonous 
to all classes of livestock, but cattle and sheep are the 
ones commonly affected.  The meaty flesh of the fruit 
is not toxic. 
 
Hydrocyanic acid (HCN) is often called Prussic acid.  
HCN does not occur freely as a plant compound.  It is 
formed only after disruption of the plant cell, either 
by mechanical injury or a sudden freeze.  Only then 
do the degradative enzymes (hydroxynitrile lyases) 
and glycoside come into contact and mix together.  
HCN acid occurs in greatest amounts in the leaves.  
Generally, the amount of HCN in the leaves lessens 
as the growing season progresses.  By autumn 
chokecherry leaves have so little glycoside, a 
component of HCN, they are not normally considered 
hazardous.  Drought stress may cause the leaves to 
concentrate the glycoside in heavier amounts than 
usual.  Wilted leaves are more toxic per unit weight 
due to dehydration, which concentrates the 
components, which make up HCN.  HCN is so toxic 
at low levels because it inhibits blood cells from 
absorbing oxygen.  One symptom of HCN poisoning 
is the blood turns bright red when exposed to the air 
and it clots abnormally slow.  
 
Cyanogenic glycosides (prunasin, produced in the 
leaves and twigs, and amygdalin, produced in the 
stone) are the building blocks for HCN.  Of the two, 


Page 5
prunasin is found in a much larger quantity. HCN is 
most commonly formed in the plant due to 
mechanical injury (such as browsing), a sudden 
change in temperature (an early and heavy frost) or in 
the animal during digestion.  The glycosides can 
either be hydrolyzed by enzymes in the plants or by 
rumen microorganisms. The glycosides occur in 
vacuoles in plant tissue while the enzymes are found 
in the cytosol. 
 
Ingestion of about 0.25 percent of an animal s body 
weight, or 50 milligrams/kilogram of body weight, is 
the Lethal Dose of fifty percent of animals (LD50).  
This means less than 4 ounces of fresh leaves can be 
toxic to a 100 pound animal. 
 
Poisoning generally occurs when animals graze this 
amount or more in an hour or less.  Formation of 
HCN must occur primarily within the short time 
between the mastication of the forage and its arrival 
in the stomach, for the acidic contents of the stomach 
slows down the reaction of the chemical process 
which creates the HCN.  The toxic elements become 
even more active if the animal drinks water 
immediately after browsing.  HCN works so quickly 
by the time poisoning symptoms are identified it is 
generally too late to treat.  Injection of a combination 
of sodium thiosulfate and sodium nitrite in the veins 
or peritoneum is the recommended antidote.  
Oxidizing substances such as potassium 
permanganate or hydrogen peroxide given as a 
drench may help some.  Any other medications 
promoting respiratory help and nerve stimulants may 
also contribute to recovery.  For any treatment to be 
effective it must be given immediately upon 
symptoms of poisoning. 
 
Removing livestock from the HCN source is the only 
practical way to prevent mass poisoning and 
numerous losses once it has been detected. Good 
livestock management includes keeping hungry 
livestock away from areas where chokecherry is 
abundant.  Maintaining a good level of preferred 
forage in pastures will do a great deal in preventing 
HCN poisoning.  
 
When a person eats a single apple seed or cherry pit, 
though not recommended, it is unlikely to cause 
discomfort or serious illness.  However, there have 
been reported deaths, usually of children chewing on 
the stems and leaves, or swallowing the stones. 
Visible reactions to poisoning may include. anxiety. 
uneasiness. confusion. dizziness. vertigo.  headache. 
nausea. vomiting. the lips turn blue. bloating.  
dilation of the eyes. muscular weakness. abnormal 
breathing, either very labored or very rapid. paralysis 
 
 
of the throat. irregular heart beat. convulsions. coma 
ensues and finally death.  Clinically, death results 
from the general anoxic state created by the 
inhibition of cytochrome oxidase.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_SeedsandPlantProduction TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_SeedsandPlantProduction='Chokecherry can be propagated by seed, rhizome 
cuttings, suckers, crown division, semi-hardwood 
cuttings and grafting.  Generally, seed crops are 
regular and viable.  The flowers are more abundant 
and more fruit is produced on plants growing on open 
sites or in forest clearings.  Natural dispersal of the 
seed occurs when it passes through the digestive 
tracts of mammals and birds.  The seeds may be 
carried a long distance from the parent plant in this 
manner.  If the rhizomatous roots are damaged due to 
a mechanical injury suckers will be produced.  This is 
often how thickets are formed.  A fire initially causes 
major damage to a stand of chokecherry.  However, 
regrowth is enhanced for several years following a 
burn.  It sprouts vigorously from surviving root 
crowns and suckers arise from the rhizomes. 
Chokecherry has seed dormancy. About half of the 
seed which is not stratified germinates within a 
couple of months.  Delayed germination may occur 
up to 4 months. An after-ripening period in the 
presence of oxygen and moisture is needed for a 
majority of seed to germinate.  Good germination can 
only be expected after a cool, moist stratification 
regime lasting 90 to 160 days at 36 to 41 degrees 
Fahrenheit.  Sow 25 seeds per foot of drill row. One- 
year-old bareroot stock should be planted on deep,

from spring buds to treat venereal diseases.  The 
Sinkyone of California made Douglas-fir bark tea 
which eased colds and stomach ailments.  The 
Kayenta Navaho of Arizona used the tree to treat 
stomach disease and headaches, although what part 
of the plant was used is not known.  Also, historically 
the Kayenta Navajo ground part of tree with a certain 
rock and mixed it with corn seeds to insure a good 
crop.  The Pueblo people used the wood to 
construction dwellings while the twigs were worn on 
various parts of dancers  costumes.  Prayer sticks 
made of Douglas-fir wood were excavated from 
archeological sites in New Mexico dating back to the 
Anasazi.  The White Mountain Apache used the pitch 
of this conifer as gum and applied it to water jugs to 
make them watertight.  Douglas-fir roots were used 
in California Indian basketry. 
 
Commercial: The tree is one of the world s most 
important and valuable timber trees and historically it 
was used by Westerners for telephone poles and 
railway ties among many other uses.  Today Douglas-
fir is also grown for Christmas trees.  
 
Wildlife: The winged seeds are eaten by western 
squirrels, the red tree mouse, and the dusky-foot 
woodrat.  The foliage and twigs are browsed by 
antelope, mule and white-tailed deer, elk, and 
mountain sheep.  The staminate cones and needles of 
Douglas-fir provide a significant winter food of the 
blue grouse.

site.  This tree is common in the northern and 
central parts of Arizona, southward to northern 
Mexico, and eastward to western Texas.  Douglas-fir 
is also widespread in mixed evergreen and mixed 
conifer forests in California below 2200 m.  It is 
found in the Klamath Ranges, the outer North Coast 
Ranges, high Cascade Range, high Sierra Nevada, 
San Francisco Bay Area, Central Coast, outer South 
Coast Ranges, and northward to British Columbia.

the higher elevations of the West that receive snow 
and in the lower foothills that have moderately cold 
winters and hot summers, Douglas-fir requires 
moderate summer watering, generally 1-4 times per 
month depending upon the absorption rate and water 
retention capacity of the soil.  It does best in full or 
part-shade and may tolerate morning and winter sun 
in ocean-influenced areas of northern and central 
California.

If establishing the tree by seed, remove the seeds 
from the cones, gently rub the wings off, and soak 
them in water for 24 hours, drain them, and 
thoroughly surface-dry them.  Put them in a plastic 
bag, without any medium, seal the bag and place 
them in refrigerated conditions until their chilling 
treatment begins.  Allow three times the air space as 
seed space in the bag.  It is best to sow the seeds in 
late February to early March.  Expose the seeds to a 
chilling treatment of at least four weeks prior to 
sowing.  After cold stratification, plant the seeds in a 
well-drained coarse potting mix in leach tubes that 
 
 
are narrow but deep with two seeds per tube.  These 
containers should allow roots to reach the air and stop 
growing and be at least 6 inches deep.  Fertilize the 
containers with a starter formulation of fertilizer with 
low or zero nitrogen.  These containers can be kept in 
a greenhouse for the first 4 to 6 weeks, receiving 70-
degree temperatures during the day.  Keep the surface 
of the soil moist during the germination phase.  Next, 
after the first set of cotyledons, water the plants with 
a deep, thorough soaking and let the plants dry in 
between watering.  Thin the plants down to one per 
container and move the pots into a shade-house with 
30 percent shade after 4 to 6 weeks.  Protect the 
plants from wind and wildlife.   During the main 
summer growing season use a balanced fertilizer 
applied to each container.  At the end of the growing 
season, use a finisher formulation of fertilizer.  Plant 
the plants in the ground outside in the late winter or 
early spring in moist soil.  Conduct supplemental 
hand watering or irrigation if the rains are 
insufficient.  Clear weeds in a 3 feet by 3 feet area 
around the plants to encourage better survival and 
growth rate.  Make sure a protective barrier is placed 
around the conifers such as Vexar tubing to shield 
them from jack rabbits, deer, and other wildlife that 
may feed on the leaves, stems, and roots.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Description='General: Oak Family (Fagaceae).  Coast live oak, an 
evergreen tree 10 to 25 m tall, has a broad, dense 
crown and widely spreading branches.  The lower 
limbs of ungrazed trees often recline on the ground.  
Mature bark is gray and shallowly furrowed.  Leaves 
are oblong to oval, 2 to 6 cm in length, cupped, with 
entire to toothed margins.  The upper surface is 
strongly convex, deep green and smooth, but the 
lower surface is paler, with hairy-tufted vein axils.  
Like all oaks, coast live oak is monoecious and wind-
pollinated.  Acorn cups are composed of thin, flat 
scales.  The one-seeded nuts are 2 to 4 cm long, 
narrowly conical, and mature in one year.  On 
average, trees have high acorn production once every 
2 to 3 years.  Flowering takes place from February to 
April.  Fruits mature between August and October.

' WHERE symbol='quag';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Adaptation: It grows in well-drained soils on bluffs, 
gentle slopes, and canyons, and can be found up to 
1400 m in elevation.  This species is adapted to 
relatively warm, wet winters and dry summers 
moderated by fog and cool temperatures, but does not 
occur where the ground freezes.  Although tolerant of 
various soil types, live oak prefers a deep loam.  
Common associates include species of sumac, 
lemonade berry, and toyon.  Coast live oak is 
particularly well adapted to fire.  Branches may 
produce new shoots after having been lightly burned.  
Trunks exposed to moderate fires often resprout from 
the base.  Like most oaks, it has an obligate 
relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which provide 
critical moisture and nutrients 
 
Propagation by seeds: Oak seeds do not store well 
and consequently seeds should be planted soon after 
maturity.  Nuts are considered ripe when they 
separate freely from the acorn cap and fall from the 
tree.  Care should be taken to collect local fruits, 
because they may be adapted to local environmental 
conditions.  Viable nuts are green to brown and have 
unblemished walls.  Nuts with discoloration or sticky 
exudates, and small holes caused by insect larvae, 
should be discarded.

Propagation of coast live oak is highly successful by 
direct seeding at the beginning of winter.  Once a site 
is chosen, prepare holes that are 10 inches in 
diameter and 4 to 5 inches deep.  One gram of a 
slow-release fertilizer should be placed in the bottom 
and covered by a small amount of soil.  Place 6 to 10 
acorns in each hole at a depth of 1 to 2 inches.  
Temporary enclosures should be used to minimize 
herbivory by rodents or birds.  A simple enclosure 
can be constructed from a 1 quart plastic dairy 
container with the bottom removed and a metal 
screen attached.  Near the end of the first season, 
seedlings should be thinned to 2 or 3 per hole and to 
1 seedling by the second season.  Supplemental 
watering may be necessary if a drought of 6 weeks or 
more occurs during the spring. 
 
Container Planting: Seeds may be planted in one-
gallon containers, using well-drained potting soil that 
includes slow-release fertilizer.  Tapered plastic 
planting tubes, with a volume of 10 cubic inches, also 
may be used.  Seeds should be planted 1 to 2 inches 
deep and the soil kept moist.  Seedlings should be 
transplanted as soon as the first true leaves mature.  
Planting holes should be at least twice as wide and 
deep as the container.  Seedlings may require 
watering every 2 to 3 weeks during the first season.  
Care should be taken to weed and mulch around 
young plants until they are 6 to 10 inches tall.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='Natural live oak regeneration from seeds tends to 
occur sporadically during winters with above average 
precipitation that falls evenly throughout the season.  
Seedlings are especially sensitive to trampling and 
too herbivory by rodents, deer, and cattle.  Common 
insects include moth larvae and tent caterpillars.  
Mature trees are especially susceptible to oak crown 
and root rot fungi (e.g., Inonotus, Ganoderma, and 
Laetiporus) which decay wood in trunks and roots.  
Activities that disturb or compact soil around trees, 
including construction and livestock grazing need to 
be avoided or carefully managed within the near the 
zone of leaf canopy.  Summer irrigation near oaks 
should also be avoided, especially in urban 
landscapes, because it promotes oak root and crown 
rot.  When desirable, mature trees consumed by fires 
may be allowed to recover from stump sprouts if 
replanting on large tracts is uneconomical.

important food for wildlife such as squirrels, mice, 
white-tailed deer, beaver, black bear, and a variety of 
birds, including ducks and turkey.   
 
Ethnobotanic: Native Americans and pioneers have 
eaten the acorns raw or cooked.  They have been 
ground into a powder and used as a thickening in 
stews etc or mixed with cereals for making bread.  
Roasted acorns have been ground and used as a 
coffee substitute.  Bitterness of the tannins is 
removed by leaching in running water.    
 
Oak galls, caused by the activity of the larvae of 
various insects, can be used as a source of tannin and 
dye.  They also are strongly astringent and can be 
used in the treatment of hemorrhages, chronic 
diarrhea, and dysentery.  Some Native Americans 
used swamp white oak to treat cholera, broken bones, 
and consumption.  Mulch of the dead leaves is 
reported to repel slugs, grubs, and various insects.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Uses='Industry: The wood of swamp white oak is light 
brown, close-grained, heavy, and hard.  It is similar 
to that of white oak (Q. alba) and usually is cut and 
sold under that name, but the amount of lumbered 
swamp white oak is a small fraction of the total for 
‘white oak.’  Also, because the lateral branches of 
swamp white oak tend to persist (compared to white 
oak), the wood is knottier and less valuable.  The 
wood is used for furniture, cabinets, veneers, interior 
finishing, and flooring, as well as for boxes, crates, 
fence posts, railroad ties, and beams and boards for 
general construction.  As in white oak, the wood 
provides tight cooperage and was once widely used 
in making barrels and kegs.  
 
Conservation: Swamp white oak is planted on 
highway rights-of-way and is frequently used as a 
shade tree for large lawns, golf courses, parks, and 
naturalized areas.  The crown shape and bi-colored 
leaves (dark above, lighter beneath) are attractive 
features. fall color is yellow, with occasional red-
purple.  The trees can grow well in areas that are dry, 
poorly drained and wet, or even occasionally flooded, 
and they will tolerate significant soil compaction.

Swamp white oak is a member of the white oak 
subgroup (subgenus Quercus) and hybridizes with 
related species, including white oak (Q. alba), 
overcup oak (Q. lyrata), and bur oak (Q. 
macrocarpa).  Swamp white oak is distinguished 
from all similar native species by its long-stalked 
acorns.

states from Iowa, Missouri, eastern Kentucky, and 
southern Wisconsin east to New York, Pennsylvania, 
Connecticut, and Massachusetts.  Isolated 
populations occur northward in Minnesota, other 
New England states, and Quebec and Ontario, and 
southward to Tennessee, Virginia, and North 
Carolina.  For current distribution, please consult the 
Plant Profile page for this species on the PLANTS 
Web site.  
 
' WHERE symbol='qubi';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Adaptation: Swamp white oak occurs in a variety of 
soils (from silty clay to silt and sandy loams) in 
swamp forests of river bottoms, streamsides, 
depressions, borders of ponds, lakes and swamps, and 
moist peaty flats.  It also occurs on moist slopes and 
poorly drained uplands, at elevations of 0-1000 
meters.  Swamp white oak grows best in full sun in 
moist to wet, deep, acidic soils.  Development of a 2-
layer root system allows it to grow well in areas that 
are flooded in spring but markedly dry in summer.    
 
Young trees of swamp white oak are tolerant of light 
shade but become more characteristic of full sun with 
maturity.  Swamp white oak usually is a minor 
component of the forests in which it occurs, perhaps 
depending on local disturbance for release into the 
canopy.  Stands of elm-ash-cottonwood will convert 
to oak-dominated stands that include swamp white 
oak.  White oak forests (of which swamp white oak is 
a component) will progress towards hickory and 
beech forests if undisturbed.   
 
Flowering occurs in May–June, during early 
development of the leaves, while fruiting occurs in 
August–October.   
General: Seed production in swamp white oak begins 
at 20–30 years.  The greatest production occurs 
between 75–100 years. good seed crops are produced 
every 3–5 years.  The acorns have no dormancy and 
may germinate the same season as ripening and 
falling.  The maximum age for trees of swamp white 
oak is 300–350 years.   
 
 
 
Swamp white oak can sprout from the stump or root 
crown if damaged or top-killed.   
 
Swamp white oak can be transplanted or propagated 
from seed.  Young plants from containers and young 
trees in ball-and-burlap are best planted in early 
spring.  Bare-root transplants also are best done in the 
spring, but these may be difficult because of the 
strong and rapid development of the taproot.   
 
Acorns are capable of germination as soon as ripe 
and must be collected for storage shortly after falling 
from the tree.  They retain viability in storage for 
only a few months, especially if allowed to dry, and 
should be stored over winter in a cool, moist place at 
1–4° C.  Germination frequency may be enhanced by 
stratifying 30–60 days at 1–5° C., but stratification is 
not required for germination.  Acorns planted in the 
fall in permanent positions give the best results.

(with pH above 7.2) may cause iron chlorosis.   
 
Because of the slow self-pruning habit of swamp 
white oak, lower branches may require pruning in 
areas where high clearance is necessary.    
 
Severe fires can top-kill mature trees of swamp white 
oak.  Fire-damaged survivors are susceptible to 
disease and insect attack.  Moderate fires may kill 
seedlings and saplings, but young individuals can re-
sprout following fire.  Acorns are easily destroyed by 
fire because of high moisture content.

basketry and oak sprouts were reputed to have great 
strength.  Types of baskets included Miwok, Pomo, 
and Maidu cradleboards with frameworks of oak 
shoots, and Kawaiisu twined work-baskets made with 
rims of blue oak branches.  The Salinan along the 
central coast made seed-beaters with a looped stick of 
oak.  The Yana used an oak paddle in cooking and 
the Achomawi made spoons of oak.  The Kawaiisu 
made a ladle about a foot long that was carved from 
the wood of blue oak.  Forked oak sticks, darkened 
by charring, were used as fake antlers on deer masks 
of the Sierra Miwok for hunting purposes.  The 
Maidu of Chico Rancheria constructed their houses 
with posts of oak.  The Western Mono also used 
young oak switches as construction materials for 
certain structures such as acorn granary frameworks.  
Digging sticks were made of blue oak by the Western 
Mono for roasting yucca bulbs, blue oak was 
preferred as firewood by the Kawaiisu and the pith of 
the oak was used for starting fires.  Fallen oak limbs 
make excellent firewood, because the coals retain 
heat and the Shasta, Sierra Miwok, and many other 
tribes used the wood.  Acorns were utilized by many 
tribes in the manufacture of toys including acorn 
buzzers and acorn tops.  Split acorns often formed 
dice, which could be rolled upon a flat, coiled 
basketry tray.  The Miwok, the Western Mono, 
Pomo, Sinkyone, and other cultural groups used 
these.  
 
Wildlife: It is well known that bears (Ursus

deer mice (Peromyscus spp.) and black-tailed deer 
(Odocileus hemionus), among many other animals

Ethnobotanic: Blue oaks had and continue to have 
significant meaning to native cultures.  The most 
significant use of blue oak was for its highly 
desirable acorns for food.  Acorns were shelled, 
dried, pounded into flour, sifted for fineness, leached 
of bitter tannins, and mixed with other acorn types 
such as black oak (Quercus kelloggii) and prepared 
as mush, soup, paddies, or bread.  Called &quot.acorn&quot. by 
contemporary gatherers, this food is still relished for 
ceremonies, festivals, dances, and family gatherings.  
 
California s blue oak provided many resources to 
California Indian people including medicine, dyes, 
utensils, games, toys, and construction materials.  
The inner bark of the blue oak was boiled and the 
brew drank for relief of arthritis by the Kawaiisu.  
Acorns served as bait in traps and snares to catch 
pigeons, flickers, quail, and jays by the Gabrielino, 
Sierra Miwok and other tribes.  California blue oaks 
grow new sprouts vigorously after a fire and these 
young shoots exhibit highly desirable qualities for 
manufacturing products.  These characteristics 
include flexibility, length, no lateral branching, easily 
split, and straightness.  These shoots were used for

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Adaptation: Blue oak woodlands cover 3 million 
acres in California, one-half of all oak covered lands.  
It is the most abundant hardwood forest type in the 
state.  Blue oak may occur in near pure stands in 
dense woodland or savanna.  It may also occur as a 
dominant in mixed stands that include foothill pine 
(Pinus sabiniana), interior live oak (Quercus 
wislizenii), valley oak (Quercus lobata), and/or coast 
live oak (Quercus agrifolia), or as a minor 
component in mixed stands of oaks and other 
hardwoods. 
 
If possible, gather acorns from many different trees 
locally, to maintain genetic diversity of blue oak and 
to ensure that the plants are adapted to the site.  The 
seeds of most oaks are short-lived and must be sown 
or refrigerated quickly, otherwise they lose their 
ability to germinate.  They are best gathered directly 
from the tree or from the ground within a short time 
of their dropping, usually within several days.  To 
test their ripeness, select an acorn that is still in its 
cap and twist it lightly.  If it pops out of the cap, the 
acorn is ripe.  Store the seeds without their caps in a 
grocery sack until ready to plant.  The seeds can be 
sown in autumn outdoors (see under direct seeding), 
or if the seeds are started in pots in the greenhouse in 
the early spring, they should be stratified for one and 
one-half months between 33 and 40 degrees in a 
refrigerator in a mix. 
 
Fill a gallon Ziploc™ bag about half full with acorns, 
and then add about a cup of dry perlite and a little bit 
 
 
of vermiculite (3:1 mixture).  Shake the bag to 
distribute the perlite around the acorns, label the bag, 
and place it in the refrigerator.  Check the bag weekly 
and discard moldy acorns.  Any acorns that have 
germinated need to be taken out of the bag and sown.  
Plant the seeds on their sides directly in long, deep 
pots (2 in. in diameter by 10 inches long) with potting 
soil and a slow release fertilizer.  Water the tubes and 
place them in diffused light in the nursery or outside, 
making sure to keep each tube suspended off the 
ground or bench so the large air holes at the bottom 
of the tube are exposed.  When the tree roots hit the 
air, they ll stop growing.  Water the pots when the 
surface of the soil is dry to the touch.  Do not over-
water. 
 
Plant the seedlings the following winter in a sunny 
location and water the transplants to ensure sufficient 
moisture and eliminate air pockets.  Be careful to 
keep the soil from falling off of the roots.  Place the 
seedlings in the ground such that the top of the soil 
from the container is even with the ground line.  Use 
a pick mattock for planting, which has a pick on one 
surface and a triangular wedge on the other surface.  
Break up the soil, which will foster root growth.  
Protect the seedlings from weeds, drying winds, 
grasshoppers, and small and large mammals that 
might feed on the roots, leaves, or trunks.  Also, 
water the seedlings deeply the first summer.  A good 
seedling protector is essential and can be a simple 
wire window screen mesh and wooden stake.  Bend 
the mesh into a cylinder that is about 6-8 inches in 
diameter and 3 feet tall.  Attach the mesh cylinder 
onto the wooden stake with staples or carpet tacks.  
Place the tube over the seedling and pound the stake 
into the ground.  Seedlings should be kept free of 
vegetation for 2 to 3 feet surrounding each seedling. 
 
Direct Seeding: Pick acorns without insect exit holes 
or diseases.  Store acorns for one and one half months 
in a sealed plastic bag in the refrigerator.  Dig a hole 
with the trowel, shovel, or hoe and be sure to break 
up the soil much deeper (one to two feet) than the 
acorn is planted and backfill with loosened soil to 
accommodate the growing of roots.  Plant the acorns 
on their sides, one to two inches deep in the fall of 
the year.  Plant several acorns in each hole and thin 
multiple seedlings down to a single most vigorous 
plant.  Water the acorns deeply the first summer.  
Weed several feet around each seedling for several 
years.  Protect the seedlings from animals until well 
established.

accept in years of unusually low rainfall.  If a drought 
year, supplemental watering can take place in the 
spring to complement natural rainfall.  Water the soil 
from halfway between the trunk and the drip line to 
10-15 feet beyond, allowing water to penetrate the 
soil to a depth of 18 to 24 inches.  It may be 
necessary to water for 4 to 6 hours to get water to this 
depth.  Keep water at least 10 feet away from the 
trunk.  Native plants that are drought-tolerant and 
shade-tolerant and require no summer water can be 
planted under the oaks, such as California brome 
(Bromus carinatus), deergrass (Muhlenbergia 
rigens), sego lily (Calochortus spp.), and bluedicks 
(Dichelostemma spp.), among others.  Light pruning 
can be done in the winter on mature oaks to remove 
weak, diseased, and dead branches, but never top 
oaks. 
 
Once established, blue oak is quite fire-tolerant.  
Many tribes in California set frequent light-surface 
fires in areas of blue oak to ensure continual yields of 
high-quality acorn.  Major reasons for their burning 
included the following: 1) facilitating acorn 
collection. (2) increasing the quality and quantity of 
acorn production through decreasing diseases. (3) 
increasing the quality and quantity of acorn 
production through decreasing acorn pests. 4) 
stimulating the production of straight shoots 
(epicormic) for the making of cultural items. 5) 
decreasing the likelihood of major conflagrations that 
would destroy the oaks. 6) burning for mushrooms. 
and 7) increasing edible grasses and other seed-
bearing herbaceous plants under the oaks and within 
the surrounding woodlands.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_='Uses 
Ethnobotanic: California black oak provided a 
fountain of resources to Native Americans of 
California and Oregon including food, medicine, 
dyes, utensils, games, toys, and construction 
materials.  Large quantities of young, supple sprouts 
were utilized for myriad items.  An abundance of 
acorns were gathered and formed a staple food 
throughout much of California--eaten in the form of a 
soup, mush, bread, or patties.  Today, acorns are still 
gathered by people of many different tribes in 
California and southern Oregon and relished as food.  
The tree and its uses are important touchstones for 
maintaining tribal ethnicity.   
 
Wildlife: It is well known that bears (Ursus 
americanus), ground squirrels (Spermophilus scrofa), 
jays (Cyanocitta stelleri), band-tailed pigeons 
(Columba fasciata), acorn woodpeckers (Melanerpes 
formicivorus), pocket gophers (Thomomys bottae), 
deer mice (Peromyscus spp.) and black-tailed deer 
(Odocileus hemionus), among many other animals, 
find acorns a favorite food source.  Studies have 
shown that birds can harvest significant amounts of 
acorn from tree canopies within a short duration and 
bears will also sometimes harvest acorns before the 
crop has dropped. 
 
Building Materials: California black oak is currently 
utilized for high-grade lumber and pallets, industrial 
timbers, sawdust for mulching, and fuel wood.  Its 
hardness and finishing characteristics make it suitable 
for industrial flooring and its grain characteristics 
make it desirable for paneling and furniture.

OAK 
Quercus rubra L. 
Plant Symbol = QURU 
 
Contributed by: USDA NRCS National Plant Data 
Center and the Biota of North America Program 
Conservation: Northern red oak is commonly planted 
as a landscape tree in eastern North America and 
Europe -- used as a shade tree on lawns, parks, 
campuses, golf courses, etc, where space is sufficient.  
It is fast growing, easy to transplant, tolerant of urban 
conditions (including dry and acidic soil and air 
pollution), the abundant nuts attract wildlife, and the 
leaves develop a brick-red fall color.  It has been used 
in various rehabilitation projects, including 
revegetation of coal mine spoils in states of the east 
central United States (Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, 
Kentucky, and Pennsylvania).

often reaching 20–30 m tall, less commonly up to 50 
m. bark dark gray or black, shallowly furrowed into 
broad hard scaly ridges, inner bark reddish to pink. 
generally developing a strong taproot and network of 
deep, spreading laterals.  Leaves are deciduous, 
alternate, elliptic, 10–25 cm long and 8–15 cm wide, 
divided less than halfway to midvein into 7–11 
shallow wavy lobes with a few irregular bristle-
tipped teeth, sinuses usually extending less than 1/2 
distance to midrib, glabrous and dull green above, 
light dull green below with tufts of hairs in vein 
angles.  Male and female flowers are borne in 
separate catkins on the same tree (the species 
monoecious),  the staminate catkins in leaf axils of 
the previous year s growth, the pistillate in 2–many-
flowered spikes in the leaf axils.  Acorns maturing in 
the second year, about 15–30 cm long, with a broad 
usually shallow cup, borne singly or in clusters of 2–
5.  The common name is in reference to the red fall 
foliage color, red petioles, and reddish interior wood.  
This is a different species from “southern red oak” 
(Q. falcata).  
 
Northern red oak is a member of the red oak 
subgroup (subg. Erythrobalanus = sect. Lobatae).  It 
hybridizes with related species, including scarlet oak 
(Q. coccinea), northern pin oak (Q. ellipsoidalis), 
shingle oak (Q. imbricata), scrub oak (Q. ilicifolia), 
blackjack oak (Q. marilandica), swamp oak (Q. 
palustris), willow oak (Q. phellos), Shumard oak (Q. 
shumardii), and black oak (Q. velutina).

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Uses='Industry: Northern red oak is an important source of 
hardwood lumber.  The wood is close-grained, heavy, 
and hard. it machines well and accepts a variety of 
finishes.  It is used for furniture, veneer, interior 
finishing, cabinets, paneling, and flooring as well as 
for agricultural implements, posts, and railway ties.   
 
Wildlife: Northern red oak provides good cover and 
nesting sites (including cavities) for a wide variety of 
birds and mammals.  Deer, elk, moose, and rabbits 
commonly browse leaves and young seedlings and 
the acorns are eaten by a wide variety of large and 
small mammals and birds.   
 
Ethnobotanic: The acorns of red oak (and other oak 
species) were an important food source for Native 
Americans.  To remove bitter tannins, they were 
boiled, leached with ashes, soaked for days in water, 
or buried over winter.  Some tribes used red oak bark 
as a medicine for heart troubles and bronchial 
infections or as an astringent, disinfectant, and 
cleanser.

Variation within the species: There are different 
interpretations of variation patterns among trees of 
northern red oak.  A single species without formally 
variants is sometimes recognized, or two varieties 
may be recognized.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Distribution TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Distribution='Northern red oak is widely distributed throughout 
much of the eastern United States and southeastern 
Canada.  It grows from Quebec, Ontario, Nova 
Scotia, and New Brunswick southward to 
southwestern Georgia, Alabama, northern 
Mississippi, northern Arkansas, and eastern 
Oklahoma.  Northern red oak extends westward 
through Minnesota and Iowa, south through eastern 
Nebraska and Kansas to eastern Oklahoma.  It occurs 
locally in eastern and southwestern Louisiana and 
western Mississippi.  For current distribution, please

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Adaptation: Northern red oak commonly grows on 
mesic slopes and well-drained uplands, less 
commonly on dry slopes or poorly drained uplands, 
at (0-) 150–1800 meters in elevation.  It typically 
grows on lower and middle slopes, in coves, ravines, 
and on valley floors, most commonly on N- and E-
facing slopes and on clay, loam, and sandy or 
gravelly soils.  Best growth is in full sun and well 
drained, slightly acidic, sandy loam.  It occurs as a 
dominant in many natural communities, including 
mixed mesophytic and pine-oak.    
 
Northern red oak is intermediate in shade tolerance 
but generally unable to establish beneath its own 
canopy.  Seedlings usually do not reach sapling or 
pole size unless gaps are created in the canopy.  
 
 
Northern red oak is often replaced by more shade-
tolerant species such as sugar maple and American 
basswood.   
 
Flowering occurs in April–May, during or before leaf 
development, while fruiting (August–) September–
October. 
 
General: Northern red oak generally first bears fruit 
at about 20–25 years, although most trees do not 
produce acorns in abundance until 40–50 years.  
Good crops are produced every 2–5 years.  In most 
years, birds, mammals, and insects commonly 
destroy up to 80% of the crop and nearly the entire 
crop can be eliminated in poor years.  Seeds on the 
soil surface are particularly vulnerable to rodent 
predation, and germination frequencies are much 
higher when a layer of leaf litter covers acorns.  
Under natural conditions, acorns generally germinate 
in the spring after over-wintering breaks dormancy.   
 
Germination and seedling establishment may be 
successful in full and partial shade, but early growth 
is reduced by shade, poor soil, and competing 
herbaceous vegetation.  Seedlings in mature stands 
may be present in large number, but few survive 
more than a few years or grow to more than 15–20 
cm in height.  Under optimal conditions, northern red 
oak is fast growing and trees may live up to 500 
years.    
 
Seedlings, saplings, and small poles of northern red 
oak can sprout if cut or burned.  Although young 
oaks typically stump sprout readily, older and larger 
individuals also may sprout.    
 
' WHERE symbol='quru';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='The tight, relatively thin bark of northern red oak 
makes the trees more susceptible to fire damage than 
in species of oak with rougher, corkier bark.  Apart 
from immediate mortality, damaged basal cambial 
tissue permits the entry of insects and heart-rot decay 
that may ultimately kill the tree.  Even so, northern 
red oak is adapted to periodic fire, which is integrally 
associated with oak forests.  Older, larger individuals 
often survive fire and seedlings, saplings, and pole-
sized individuals commonly sprout vigorously from 
the stumps or root collar after being top-killed by 
fire.  Increased fire suppression has favored more 
shade-tolerant hardwoods and resulted in a decrease 
in oaks.   
 
Acorns can maintain viability in controlled storage 
for up to 2–3 years.  They should be stratified at 1-3° 
C for several months. those from northern 
populations require the longer period.  Growth is best 

Page 3
when sown as soon as ripe into permanent position or 
in an outdoor seedbed protected from predation.  
Cuttings obtained from young trees can be rooted if 
treated with hormones.  Transplants of bare root 
stock are best done in spring.  Because of its 
usefulness and popularity, northern red oak is 
commonly available in ball-and-burlap and in 
containers.   
 
The gypsy moth and numerous other insects can 
attack northern red oak, occasionally causing serious 
damage.  Numerous caterpillars enjoy oak foliage, 
but feeding damage is usually not severe.  Oak 
decline is a serious disease of northern red oak and 
has affected the species throughout much of the 
central Appalachian region.   
 
Oak wilt  
Northern red oak is susceptible to oak wilt, a fungal 
disease that invades the water-conducting vessels and 
plugs them.  As water movement is slowed, the 
leaves wilt and rapidly drop off the tree.  The disease 
begins with a crinkling and paling of the leaves, 
followed by wilting and browning from the margins 
inward.  Necrosis may be strongest along the veins or 
between them.  The symptoms move down branches 
toward the center of the tree and the tree may die 
within 1–3 months, although some diseased trees 
may survive up to a year.  The disease may be spread 
by insects (primarily beetles) or pruning tools, but 
most of the tree loss in oak wilt centers results from 
transmission through root spread between adjoining 
trees.  A trench (dug and then immediately filled) 
between neighboring trees severs the roots and 
prevents fungus spread.  Dead and infected trees must 
be destroyed – once a tree has become infected, there 
is little chance to save it.  The wood may be used for 
firewood provided it is debarked or covered and 
sealed during the spring and summer (Johnson and 
Appel 2000. Roberts 2000. Wisconsin Dept. of 
Natural Resources 2000. City of Austin 2000).   
 
This disease most seriously infects species of the red 
oak group (including black and live oaks).  Overcup 
oak, bur oak, white oak, and other members of the 
white oak group are not as susceptible and can be 
planted in oak wilt centers.  Oak wilt has reached 
epidemic proportions in Texas and in the mid-West 
from Iowa and Minnesota through Michigan and 
Wisconsin into Ohio, West Virginia, and 
Pennsylvania.

should be planted with this in mind.   The species has 
been successfully grown in urban areas where air 
pollution, poor drainage, compacted soil, and/or 
drought are common.  Compared to the similar 
northern red oak (Q. rubra), Shumard oak tolerates a 
broader range of soil moisture, and its more southern 
distribution provides stock better suited for that area.  
Shumard also apparently is little affected by 
chlorosis, which often is a problem for other oaks in 
high pH soils.   
 
Industry: The wood of Shumard oak is close-grained, 
hard, strong, and heavy.  It is generally marketed 
with other red oak lumber for flooring, furniture, 
interior trim and veneer, cabinetry, and lumber.  
Numerous species of songbirds, wild turkeys, 
waterfowl, white-tailed deer, squirrels, and other 
mammals eat the acorns, which are produced in 
abundance. 
 
Ethnobotanic: The acorns are bitter, but edible, if the 
tannins are leached out.  They have been ground and 
used as flour, roasted and ground to make coffee, and 
eaten whole.

for 60-90 days at 1-5° C.  Seed can be stored moist 
and cool overwinter but is best sown outdoors as 
soon as ripe.  Best growth is from seed sown in situ.  
Young trees from deep pots are relatively easily 
transplanted, but those left in a nursery bed for more 
than two growing seasons without being moved will 
have problems because of the deep taproot.   
 
Reforestation of agricultural lands to bottomland 
hardwoods has been successful with Shumard oak 
direct-seeded to otherwise unprepared sites.  Soil 
fertilization does not improve success in early 
establishment.   
 
Shumard oak is probably moderately resistant to 
immediate fire damage, because it persists in some 
communities that are maintained by periodic fire.  
Young trees, however, are relatively thin-barked and 
basal wounding by fire usually results in at least top-
kill of such trees, either by girdling the tree or by 
creating avenues for infection by wood-rotting fungi.  
Top-killed Shumard oak produces root sprouts.   
 
Initial pruning to develop a central leader will 
provide better shaped street trees.  Pruning in the 
dormant season or in summer is best, but pruning 
should be avoided in late spring and early summer in 
areas where oak wilt is present.    
 
Oak wilt  
Shumard oak is highly susceptible to oak wilt 
infection, a fungal disease that invades the water-
conducting vessels and plugs them.  As water 
movement is slowed, the leaves wilt and rapidly drop 
off the tree.  The disease begins with a crinkling and 
paling of the leaves, followed by wilting and 
browning from the margins inward.  Necrosis may be 
strongest along the veins or between them.  The

INTERIOR LIVE OAK
Quercus wislizeni A. DC. 
 
 
Ethnobotanic: After leaching away the bitter tannins, 
Native Americans used the acorns of many oaks 
(Quercus spp.) for cooking oils, soups, stews, or 
breads after leaching away the tannins.  Interior live 
oak also has a high value for fuel wood and is also 
used for landscaping.

evergreen, which grows as a large shrub or small tree.  
Plants may reach 30 to 75 feet in height or assume a 
shrub-like growth form with heights of only 8 to 10 
feet.  Leaves, which persist for 2 years, are mostly 
oblong-to-elliptic or lanceolate, and spiny-toothed to 
entire.  Both leaf surfaces are shiny green but the 
upper surface is darker.  Interior live oak is 
monoecious.  Male flowers are borne in catkins 1 to 3 
inches in length, whereas female flowers grow in 
clusters of two to four in the upper leaf axils.

Adaptation: This species is generally found on soils 
with a pH range between 5.6 and 7.5, with depths of 
20 to 40 inches.  Interior live oak grows particularly 
well on dry, shallow, well-drained loams, clay loams, 
gravelly loams, or gravel.  Interior live oak is tolerant 
of shade, particularly when young.  Interior live oak 
appears to be well-adapted to persist with or without 
fire.  For more information, consult the FEIS 
database. 
 
Propagation/Regeneration: Interior live oak 
regenerates vegetatively after disturbance and also 
reproduces through seed.  Cleaned acorns average 
approximately 125 per pound (275/kg).  Annual seed 
production appears to be somewhat variable, 
although each interior live oak tree generally 
produces good seed crops at 5- to 7-year intervals.  
Acorns generally ripen after mid-August.  Research 
indicates that the acorns of interior live oak can 
germinate without exposure to low temperatures.  
However, exposure to temperatures of 32 to 41° F 
can effectively stratify seed and enhance germination.

birds, including turkey, ruffed grouse, robins, and 
flickers, and for various small mammals (e.g., 
raccoon, opossum, chipmunk).  The foliage is 
relatively unpalatable to most species of wildlife and 
domestic livestock.  Thickets of fragrant sumac 
provide cover for many species of birds and small 
mammals.    
  
Conservation: Fragrant sumac is not widely used for 
landscape plantings, probably because of its 
relatively small size, but it is used as a ground cover, 
especially on banks.  The plants are hardy and can 
grow in sun or partial shade.  The main ornamental 
feature is the orange to red fall foliage color.  Several 
cultivars have been selected – mostly for variation in 
growth form.  Fragrant sumac also has been used for 
rehabilitating disturbed sites such as banks, cuts, and 
fills.    
 
Ethnobotanic: American Indians made a tart drink 
(“Indian lemonade”) from the ripe fruits of fragrant 
sumac (larger-fruited Rhus species provide a larger 
quantity of the same substance).  The bark of all 
sumacs has been used as an astringent and leaves and 
bark can be used for tanning leather because of the

vigorously after fire, and it can be propagated from

Seed dormancy results from the presence of a hard, 
impermeable seed coat.  Fire scarifies seeds, 
promoting germination. various artificial methods of 
pretreatment have been tested, including sulfuric 
acid, hot water soaks, mechanical scarification, and 
cold treatment.  Pretreated sumac seeds generally 
begin germination within 10-20 days.  The resistant 
seed coats probably allow the seeds to remain viable 
for several years in the humus layer, as do those in

to upright native shrubs 0.5-2(-2.5) meters tall (rarely 
tree-like), forming colonial thickets of up to 10 feet 
spread, suckering from the roots, the branches slender 
ascending, puberulent, glabrate, or densely pilose. 
buds naked, tiny, yellow, hairy, surrounded by a 
raised, circular leaf scar.  Leaves: deciduous, 
alternate, compound with 3 leaflets, variable in 
shape, lobing, and margin, the leaflets unstalked, 
ovate to rhomboid, more or less wedge-shaped at the 
base, coarsely-toothed, usually shiny-glabrous above, 
the terminal leaflet 3-6.5 cm long. summer foliage 
green to glossy blue-green, turning orange to red or 
purple in the fall.  Flowers: yellow, in small, dense 
inflorescences on short lateral shoots, opening before 
the leaves, bisexual and unisexual, both types borne 
on the same plant (the species polygamodioecious). 
male (staminate) flowers in yellowish catkins, female 
(pistillate) flowers in bright yellow, short panicles at 
the ends of branches.  Fruits: 5-7 mm in diameter, 
bright red at maturity and densely hairy, containing a 
single nutlet 3.8-4.5 mm long, in terminal clusters.  
The common name “sumac” is from the Middle 
English for related tree.  The leaves are fragrant or at 
least odorous.   
 
Variation within the species: three varieties are 
currently recognized, based on differences in 
geography, leaf shape, and pubescence of stems, 
leaves, and fruits.  Var. aromatica occurs over nearly 
the whole range of the species.   
 
Rhus aromatica var. arenaria (Greene) Fern. – 
restricted to Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois.

birds, including turkey, ruffed grouse, robins, and 
flickers, and for various small mammals (e.g., 
raccoon, opossum, chipmunk).  The foliage is 
relatively unpalatable to most species of wildlife and 
domestic livestock.  Thickets of fragrant sumac 
provide cover for many species of birds and small 
mammals.    
  
Conservation: Fragrant sumac is not widely used for 
landscape plantings, probably because of its 
relatively small size, but it is used as a ground cover, 
especially on banks.  The plants are hardy and can 
grow in sun or partial shade.  The main ornamental 
feature is the orange to red fall foliage color.  Several 
cultivars have been selected – mostly for variation in 
growth form.  Fragrant sumac also has been used for 
rehabilitating disturbed sites such as banks, cuts, and 
fills.    
 
Ethnobotanic: American Indians made a tart drink 
(“Indian lemonade”) from the ripe fruits of fragrant 
sumac (larger-fruited Rhus species provide a larger 
quantity of the same substance).  The bark of all

General: Sumac Family (Anacardiaceae).  Smooth 
sumac can be a shrub or small tree growing up to 3 
meters in height.  Smooth sumac forms thickets from 
root suckers.  The stems and branches are hairless 
and covered with a whitish waxy coating.  The leaves 
are alternate and pinnately compound (3-5 dm long).  
Smooth sumac has 11-31 leaflets that are lanceolate 
to oblong-lanceolate (7-9 cm long).  The leaflets 
taper to a point at the tip and are rounded at the base.  
The margins are sharply serrated.  The upper surface 
is dark green and lustrous.  The lower surface is 
covered with a whitish waxy coating.  Smooth sumac 
has a branched, racemose inflorescence with flowers 
maturing from the bottom up (10-25 cm long).  The 
flowers have a greenish color.  The drupes have a 
flattened-globe shape (3.5-4.5 mm long) and are 
covered with red, sticky hairs.  The seeds are 
yellowish in color and smooth (3-3.5 mm long). 
 
Distribution: For current distribution, please consult

It is useful for windbreaks, shelterbelts, and because 
of the strong root development, for erosion control.  
Var. trilobata has been successfully transplanted onto 
phosphate mine spoils in Idaho.   Bighorn,  a cultivar 
from Wyoming, has been widely planted on pinyon-
juniper sites, and the species has been successfully 
transplanted in aspen-maple, pinyon-juniper, and 
mountain-brush zones.

diameter often greater than the plant height. roots 
deep and extensively branched, with woody, shallow, 
and spreading rhizomes, sometimes connecting 
shrubs more than 9 m apart. sprouts arising from 
rhizomes and root crown.  Leaves: deciduous, 
alternate, compound with 3 leaflets, variable in size, 
shape, lobing, and margin, the leaflets unstalked, 
ovate to rhomboid, more or less wedge-shaped at the 
base, coarsely-toothed, usually shiny-glabrous above, 
the terminal leaflet 3-6.5 cm long. summer foliage 
green, becoming orange or reddish in the fall.  
Flowers: yellowish to whitish, in small, dense 
clusters on short lateral shoots, opening before the 
leaves, bisexual and unisexual, both types borne on 
the same plant (the species polygamodioecious). 
male (staminate) flowers in yellowish catkins, female 
(pistillate) flowers in bright yellow, short clusters at 
the ends of branches.  Fruits: 5-7 mm in diameter, red 
at maturity and sparsely hairy, each containing a 
single nutlet.  Rhus trilobata closely resembles R. 
aromatica and is often treated as part of the latter.  
The common name is derived from the odor of the 
leaves, especially when bruised.   
Variation within the species: a number of ecotypes 
are known to occur in skunkbush.  Growth form and 
height vary geographically – plants are more 
branched and compact in the Southwest and taller in 
the north part of the range.  Current practice 
recognizes six formal varieties, distinguished by 
morphological characteristics such as growth form, 
height, leaf shape and size, fruit shape and

Americans in foods, beverages, and medicines.  
Pliable young stems were woven with grass stems 
into durable baskets that would hold water.  The 
leaves are said to have been smoked by the 
Comanches. 
  
Wildlife &amp. Livestock: Livestock in some locations use 
skunkbush, but it is not a preferred species.  It has 
been planted in some locations as a deterrent to 
grazing animals.  It provides some browse for deer, 
elk, and pronghorn when more preferred forage is 
unavailable.  Skunkbush fruits, which persist through 
fall and winter, provide a food for birds and small 
mammals when other foods are scarce or unavailable.  
Skunkbush also may form dense thickets that provide 
good hiding and nesting cover for small birds and 
mammals.       
 
Conservation: Skunkbush has been used as an 
ornamental (the fall leaves turn bright yellow, orange, 
and red to reddish-purple), and it has been widely 
planted at recreation sites, rest areas, and roadsides.

Skunkbush can be propagated from root and 
softwood cuttings – most effectively done well before

several years and sometimes fail to recover.

Wildlife &amp. Livestock: Livestock in some locations use 
skunkbush, but it is not a preferred species.  It has 
been planted in some locations as a deterrent to 
grazing animals.  It provides some browse for deer, 
elk, and pronghorn when more preferred forage is 
unavailable.  Skunkbush fruits, which persist through 
fall and winter, provide a food for birds and small 
mammals when other foods are scarce or unavailable.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Skunkbush produces seed nearly every year, but the

Branches 6-10 years of age produce the most viable 
fruit.  Mostly birds and mammals disperse seeds.  
Roadside colonies frequently originate from 
germination of seed in caches of mice and squirrels.  
Skunkbush, like other species of Rhus, may be an 
effective seedbank former, with long-lived seeds 
stored in the humus layer.  The seeds have dormancy 
broken by cold treatment.  Seedlings are intolerant of 
crowding, even under optimal conditions.  Growth of 
skunkbush is most rapid during the first 3-5 years, 
and plantings have remained healthy and vigorous for 
 
 
more than 20 years. healthy rhizomes have been aged 
at more than 30 years.

have the ability to delay sprouting for up to a year 
following fire.   
 
Skunkbush can be propagated from root and 
softwood cuttings – most effectively done well before 
freezing weather.  Best seed germination is from fall 
and winter planting.  The presence of seeded grasses 
has reduced the survival of skunkbush at some sites, 
and although the plants are generally drought-
tolerant, water-stressed seedlings may be stunted for 
several years and sometimes fail to recover.  
Skunkbush is generally reported to be tolerant of 
heavy grazing.

Ribes aureum Pursh var. 
villosum DC. 
Plant Symbol = RIAUV 
 
Contributed by: USDA NRCS National Plant Data 
Center &amp. the Biota of North America Program 
Kiowa Indians believed that snakes were afraid of the 
currant bush and used it as a snakebite remedy.  
Other tribes have used the fruits to color clay pots.  
  
Conservation: The fragrant (clove odor), golden-
yellow flowers of spring, yellowish to red fall 
foliage, edible fruits, and wide ecological range make 
golden currant a valued ornamental shrub for a 
variety of natural landscapes.  Golden currant is 
easily cultivated from seed or cuttings.

shrub 1-3 m tall, spineless, with numerous, erect-
arching branches forming an irregular crown up to 6 
meters tall or more. bark gray to red-brown. 
rhizomatous.  Leaves deciduous, light green and 
glossy, alternate or clustered, orbicular or cuneate-
ovate with 3-5 rounded lobes, (0.6-)1-2.5(4.7) cm 
long and wide, cuneate to subcordate at base, 
glabrous or sometimes lightly hairy beneath.  Flowers 
in short racemes of 5-10(-15), with the fragrance of 
cloves. long-tubed (from fused sepals) and trumpet-
shaped, with 5 yellow sepal lobes spreading at the 
top, with 5, short, reddish petals inserted at the top of 
the tube.  Fruit a berry 6-10 mm diameter, globose to 
ellipsoid, ripening from green to yellow to red and 
finally black to dark purple, with numerous seeds.  
The common name pertains to the conspicuous, 
golden flowers. “currant” is the general name for 
Ribes fruit.   
 
Variation within the species: Ribes odoratum, often 
considered a distinct species, recognized by its 
considerably larger flowers, has been placed (re-
placed, as var. villosum) as the eastern segment of the 
broader species.

prickles.  Leaves are deciduous, alternate, odd-
pinnately compound, leaflets 5-7(-11), obovate to 
ovate or elliptic, ca. 1.5-3(-4) cm long, finely toothed 
toward the tip.  Flowers occur on branches lateral 
from the old wood, 10-20 cm long, few in a cluster at 
the stem tip, less commonly solitary. petals 5, (10-
)15-25 mm long, pink to lilac-pink, or lavender. 
sepals lanceolate, 1-2 cm long, erect and usually 
persistent, tomentose on the margins and inner 
surface.  Fruit is a fleshy, red, globose to ellipsoid 
“hip” 5-12 mm wide, derived from the base of the 
sepals and petals. nutlets 15-35, 3-4 mm long.  
Named for Joseph Woods, 1776-1864, an early 
English student of roses.    
 
Variation within the species: many variants have 
been described, and the species now includes many 
roses previously described as species.  The following 
varieties are sometimes now recognized (Cronquist &amp. 
Holmgren 1997) but they are combined as a single 
variable species by others (e.g., Ertter 1993 in The 
Jepson Manual).

birds and mammals are sustained by the persistent 
dry hips when the ground is covered with snow.  The 
plants are browsed by livestock and big game from 
spring through fall, but the young spring leaves are 
especially palatable.  Porcupines and beavers also 
browse the leaves.  Thickets formed by Woods’ rose 
provide nesting and escape cover for many birds and 
small mammals.    
  
Conservation: The rhizome system makes Woods’ 
rose effective in erosion control, and the species has 
been used to revegetate disturbed sites along road 
cuts, streambanks, and seeps.  Plants are used as 
ornamentals near homes to attract birds and other 
wildlife.   
 
Ethnobotanic: Native Americans used the roots, 
stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits of Woods’ rose for 
foods and therapeutic materials.  The hips are a

Externally, the leaves and roots are used as a gargle 
to treat tonsillitis and mouth inflammations, sores, 
minor wounds, burns and varicose ulcers (Brown 
1995).  Europeans in the 17th century regarded the 
raspberries as an antispasmodic and they made a 
syrup of the juice which they employed to prevent 
vomiting (Readers Digest 1990).  In the 18th century 
physicians and herbalists deemed the berries useful as 
a remedy for heart disease (Ibid).  Red raspberries are 
eaten fresh or in jams and jellies, or added to pies and 
other baked goods, candies and dairy products to add 
flavor.  Purple to dull blue dye was obtained from the 
fruit.   
 
Wildlife: American red raspberry provides food and

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_='Uses 
Ethnobotanical: Salmonberry fruits are edible, but 
are considered too soft to dry.  Both the large, 
raspberry-like fruit and the young shoots were widely 
eaten by coastal peoples of British Columbia and 
western Washington.  Fruits were an important food 
source for Native Americans and are still collected 
today.  The berries are among the first to ripen, and 
are a beautiful salmon color that stand out in the 
generally rainy weather of spring.  Large quantities of 
fresh berries were picked and were often served at 
feasts, usually with oil or ooligan grease, said to 
prevent constipation.  Today salmonberries are 
frozen, canned, or made into jams and jellies. 
 
The young growing sprouts are harvested from April 
to early June.  They are snapped off with the fingers 
before they become woody, then peeled, and eaten 
raw or, more commonly cooked by steaming or 
boiling.  Sprouts are also tied in bundles and pit-
cooked.  They were usually eaten with seal oil or 
ooligan grease, and, more recently, with sugar, often 
as an accompaniment to dried salmon or meat.  Some 
Nuu-chah-nulth people boiled the leaves with fish as 
a flavoring.  The Kaigani Haida used the leaves to 
line baskets, wipe fish, and cover food in steaming 
pits. 
 
                          Plant Guide  
 
The Makah dry and peel a branch of salmonberry, 
remove the pith, and use it for a pipe stem.  The 
Quileute plug the hair seal float used in whaling with 
the hollow stem of elderberry wood, then insert a 
piece of salmonberry wood as a stopper.  This 
salmonberry plug can be removed for further 
inflation of the float. 
 
Salmonberry has an astringent quality in the bark and 
leaves.  The Quileute chew the leaves and spit them 
on burns, and in winter when the leaves are not 
obtainable they use the bark instead.  The Makah 
pound the bark and lay it on an aching tooth or a 
festering wound to kill the pain.  The Quinault boil 
the bark in seawater, and the brew is drank to lessen 
labor pains and to clean infected wounds, especially 
burns. 
 
Wildlife: Salmonberry fruits, ripe from June to 
August, rank at the very top of foods for wildlife.  
The early blooming flowers, blossoming from March 
to June, are an important nectar source for bees, 
butterflies, various other insects, and hummingbirds.  
The berries are relished by songbirds, bears, and 
small mammals a much as they are enjoyed by 
humans.  Leaves, twigs, and stems are grazed by 
browsers, such as deer, elk, and rabbits.  The dense 
thickets provide excellent escape habitats for birds 
and small mammals, and nesting sites for songbirds. 
 
Restoration: Salmonberry is a useful shrub in created 
wetlands because it transplants easily, with good soil-
binding qualities once it is established, and is well 
adapted to eroded or disturbed sites.

brown to rust-red color.  The flowers are large (about 
1.5 inches across) and borne singly.  Salmonberry 
blooms in early spring with beautiful deep pink rose-
like flowers.  The leaves are pinnately compound.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Distribution TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Distribution='For current distribution, please consult the Plant 
Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
site.  Salmonberry grows in moist places and 
wetlands, and is especially abundant along 
streamsides and riparian areas at elevations below 
1400 m.  It can form dense thickets or grow 
individually.  The range is from Alaska south to 
northwestern California, from the coast to the 
Cascades.  
 
' WHERE symbol='rusp';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Salmonberry grows well in full or partial shade.  
Cultivars are available in the horticultural trade.  
These shrubs are good for stabilizing or restoring 
degraded sites, and for slope stabilization and erosion 
control.  Salmonberry shrubs may become invasive 
one they are established. 
 
Live Plant Collections: Salmonberry is easily grown 
from layering, basal sprouting, rhizomes, root 
cuttings, and hardwood cuttings.  Small offshoots 
growing from the parent plant under four feet tall are 
easily transplanted.  Branches that touch the ground 
tend to root, and they can be separated from the 
parent plant.  Pull the rooted tips of larger plants and 
plant into one-gallon pots. 
 
Hardwood cuttings should be 1-2.5 cm in diameter 
and 45 cm or more in length with at least three nodes.  
Rooting invariably occurs at the base of a cutting and 
at nodes with leaf buds.  Store hardwood cuttings 
over winter in damp sawdust of peat moss. this 
promotes callusing and prevents desiccation.  As with 
hardwood cuttings of other species, vigorous rooting 
can be enhanced in Rubus species by using a liquid 
rooting hormone and burying the cuttings in damp 
wood shavings. 
 
Seed Collections: Salmonberry can be grown from 
fresh seed.  Collect the fruits when ripe (they are 
orange or red).  Generally salmonberry fruits ripen 
from June through August, and can be collected by 
hand.  Extract seeds by macerating in water and 
floating off the pulp and empty seeds.  Seed should 
be planted in the fall.  If seeds are to be stored, they 
should be dried.  Seeds will keep for several years at 
5°C.  A warm stratification of 20-30°C is necessary 
for spring-sown seeds, although fall sowing provides 
best germination.  Germination is improved if seeds 
are scarified with sulfuric acid for 20-60 minutes or 
with a 1% solution of sodium hyperchlorite for seven 
days prior to cold stratification.  Seeds need 90 days 
 
 
of cold stratification at 36° - 41°F to break seed 
dormancy.  Sow in ground in drills, cover lightly with 
soil, and mulch over winter.  Seeds per kilogram:

the pith of new sprouts.  The pith from branches was 
made into a decoction used to wash and dress burns.  
Infusions of the plant were used to treat lower chest 
pain, nausea, vomiting, indigestion, constipation and 
diarrhea.  The bark was used as an emetic 
purification after funeral ceremonies.  Bark infusions 
were given to babies and children to treat itching, 
enlarged eyes, fever, drooling, and loss of appetite.  
Children with worms drank and were bathed in an 
infusion that included the bark of sassafras.  The 
plant was taken to treat gallstones and bladder pain.  
In addition to this variety of medicinal uses, sassafras 
was used for food, construction and other purposes.  
The leaves were used fresh as a spice, much like bay 
leaves, for flavoring in meat soups. Leaves were 
dried and pounded and used as a thickening agent and 
to add flavor to foods and soups.  “Filé”, made from 
the ground roots or leaves, is an important spice used 
today in Cajun foods, such as gumbo.  The white or 
red roots, made a pleasant-tasting tea, although the 
red roots were preferred.  The wood from the 
sassafras tree was used to make furniture.  The 
flowers were used as a fertilizer when planting beans.  
The plant was used as a fragrance to scent soap. The 
bark contains oil of sassafras, an important flavoring.   
 
Wildlife: The fruits are readily eaten by wildlife.  
Birds, such as quails, wild turkeys, kingbirds, crested 
flycatchers, mockingbirds, sapsuckers, pileated 
woodpeckers, yellowthroat warblers and phoebes eat 
the fruits and disperse the seeds.  Black bears, beaver, 
rabbits and squirrels eat the fruit, bark and wood.  
White-tailed deer browse the twigs and foliage. 
 
Other: Sassafras has been cultivated since 1630 for 
its leaves, bark, and wood.  The plants are used for 
tea, oil, and soap.  The heartwood is orange-brown 
and course-grained.  It is used for purposes requiring 
lightwood, such as boat construction, because it is 
soft but durable.

trees have reddish brown bark that is rough, thick, 
and deeply ridged.  The leaves are alternate and 
variable in shape with either none or one to three 
lobes at the apex.  The two-lobed leaves are mitten-
shaped.  The leaves are light, bright green during the 
summer and turn to bright yellow-orange and red-
orange in the fall.  The trees are dioecious (a tree will 
have either male or female flowers) with fragrant 
flowers.  The female flowers (1cm across), borne on 
small, terminal clusters before the leaves, are without 
petals, but have six greenish-yellow sepals (3 to 5 
mm long).  Male flowers are inconspicuous.  The 
female trees have small, oval fruits (6 to 10 mm) that 
are dark blue with thick, red stalks.  The leaf buds 
appear at the same time the tree flowers in early 
spring.  The fruits ripen in the fall. 
 
Distribution: Sassafras is native to the eastern United 
States.  For current distribution, please consult the 
Plant Profile page for this species on the PLANTS 
Web site.  
 
Habitat: This plant is a pioneer tree on disturbed sites 
in its native range.  It is adapted to various soils with 
low pH.  It can be found in woodlands, fields and 
along roadsides.

bloom, interesting horizontal branching pattern, and 
striking fall color.  The small trees are medium to fast 
growing and work well for landscape use as 
specimen trees and mass plantings.  They are easy to 
culture and require little care.  Although adapted to 
dry, sandy soils, they do best in moist, fertile soils in 
partial to full shade.  Seeds, root-cuttings or suckers 
may propagate sassafras trees.  Seeds are produced 
every one or two years after the plant reaches the 
minimum seed-bearing age of ten years.  Seeds may 
be gathered when the fruits turn a dark blue.  Seeds 
should be cleaned and stored at cool temperatures 
where they will last for up to two years.  The seeds 
require prechilling for 120 days in order to germinate.  
Sow the seeds .5 to 1.5 cm deep in prepared beds in 
the late fall.  The plants do not transplant well 
because of a deep taproot.  It is therefore best to 
purchase young plants that have been grown in 
containers for successful transplanting.

baskets, drums, stirrups, tipi pegs and pins, fox and 
fish traps, hunting lodge poles, and meat-drying racks 
(Kindscher 1992).  Willows were and still are used 
for baskets throughout their range.  The Paiute, Ute, 
Shoshone, Hopi, Havasupai, Mandan, Cheyenne, 
Arapaho, Kiowa, and others use Salix lucida for 
basketweaving (James 1972, Mason 1988). 
 
Kelly Kindscher(1992) wrote in Medicinal Wild 
Plants of the Prairie: &quot.The Blackfeet made a tea from 
the fresh root of Salix species to treat internal 
hemorrhage, throat constrictions, swollen neck 
glands, and bloodshot or irritated eyes.  The twigs 
were also gathered and preserved.  Steeped in boiling 
water, they were made into a tea to cure fever or 
alleviate pain.&quot. 
 
Salix species were used as chew sticks to clean teeth 
by many other Indian tribes, including the Choctaw, 
Delaware, and Cheyenne.  The peachleaf willow was 
favored by the Osage, Delaware, and Cherokee for 
this purpose (Elvin-Lewis 1979).  The Kiowa made a 
tea of willow leaves, which they rubbed on the body 
to cure pneumonia and relieve rheumatic aches.  
They also chewed the bark to relieve toothaches 
(Vestal and Shultes 1939).  The Comanche burned 
the stems of the willow and used the ashes to treat  
sore eyes (Carlson and Jones 1939).  To restore 
themselves both physically and mentally, the Dakota 
drank a willow-bark tea (Andros 1883).  The Ojibwe 
used peachleaf willow bark externally to treat skin 
rashes. 
 
Aspirin is the pharmaceutical equivalent of willow 
bark tea, which is an effective remedy for headache, 
fever or sore throat.  More than 2,400 years ago, the 
Greeks learned to use extracts of several native 
willow species to treat pain, gout, and other illnesses.  
In more recent times, in 1839, salicylic acid was 
isolated from wild plants and manufactured 
synthetically.  Early salicylic acid-based products had 
unpleasant side effects. Sixty years later, the Bayer 
Company developed a derivative of salicylic acid, 
called it aspirin, and the rest is history. 
 
Tea made from willow leaves will cure laryngitis.  
Willow reduces inflammation of joints and 
membranes (Moore 1979).  When used as an 
analgesic, willow treats urethra and bladder irritation, 
infected wounds, and eczema.  Willow is used as an 
over-all treatment of many diseases, including hay 
fever, diarrhea, prostatitis, satyriasis, and as a relief 
of ovarian pain.  A poultice is made for treating 
gangrene and skin ulcers.  
 
Young willow shoots can be stripped of their bark 
and eaten.  The young leaves may be eaten in case of 
emergency.  The inner bark can be eaten raw, 
prepared like spaghetti, or made into flour. 
 
Riparian: Peachleaf willow is an overstory dominant 
species in many riparian ecosystems throughout the 
American west and midwest.  Riparian ecosystem 
functions provided by willows include the following: 
1) Riparian vegetation traps sediments and nutrients 
from surface runoff and prevents them from entering 
the aquatic system. 2) the dense matrix of roots in the 
riparian zone can serve as an effective filter of 
shallow groundwater. 3) water quality is improved 
through filtration and the trapping of sediment, 
nutrients (particularly nitrogen dissolved in 
groundwater), and pollutants. and 4) riparian areas 
act as a sponge by absorbing floodwaters.  The water

is then slowly released over a period of time, which 
minimizes flood damage and sustains higher base 
flows during late summer. 
 
Wildlife: Structurally complex riparian vegetation 
communities provide many different habitats and 
support a diverse array of animal species.  The 
multiple layers of vegetation provide multiple niches 
for many species of insects and wildlife canopies of 
plants growing on streambank provide shade, cooling 
stream water, while roots stabilize and create 
overhanging banks, providing habitat for fish and 
other aquatic organisms. 
 
Rabbits and many ungulates (including deer, moose, 
and elk) browse on willow twigs, foliage, and bark 
(Martin 1951).  Beaver love willow branches.  
Several species of birds eat willow buds and young 
twigs.  Riparian forests support a high diversity of 
breeding birds (Miller 1951).  The percentage of 
breeding individuals, which are migratory, is very 
high in the cottonwood-willow habitat.  Moister 
conditions in the cottonwood-willow forest may 
promote lusher plant growth, higher invertebrate 
populations and, therefore, more available food for 
flycatchers, warblers, and other migratory, 
insectivorous birds.  Riparian areas support up to 
10.6 times the density of migrant birds per hectare as 
adjacent non-riparian areas (Stevens et al. 1977).  
Most of these migratory birds belong to the foliage 
insect (47%) or air insect (34%) foraging guilds.

The NRCS, Plant Materials Center, Los Lunas, New 
Mexico, in cooperation with the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service, developed a pole planting technique 
for establishing willow (Hoag 1993a).  We reprint 
this procedure below.  &quot.Trial planting on well adapted 
sites indicate more that 80% survival of cottonwood 
and willow poles when dormant poles are cut and 
planted between November and February.  It is 
essential to monitor the water tables at proposed 
planting sites for at least one year before planting.  
Poles planted where the water table fluctuates widely 
will have lower survival rates than those planted 
where water table is relatively stable.  If groundwater 
monitoring shows the water level will drop more than 
3 feet during the growing season (May-October), 
another site should be selected.  Monitoring of 
observation wells for at least one calendar year 
before planting will allow better planting depth to 
ensure establishment.&quot.  
 
Steps for Successful Pole Plantings 
•  Select collection sites as close to the area as 
possible to conserve genetic diversity.  Try to 
match donor site and revegetation site in terms of 
soils, elevation, hydro-dynamics, permanent 
groundwater table, and soil salinity (which 
should be low).  
area for at least 1 year, preferably longer, to 
determine the lowest water table depth.  Take a 
reading at least once a month, preferably more 
often during the driest months of the year. Cut 
•  Select willow cuttings from a local, native stand 
in healthy condition.  Prune no more than 2/3 of 
plants in an area.  Willow cuttings for pole 
plantings should generally be at least 1/2 inch in 
diameter or larger.  Select the longest, straightest 
poles available.  Use only two to four-year old 
wood.  The total length of the poles needed 
depends upon the water table depth. 
•  Measure water table fluctuations in the planting 

Page 3
poles while dormant.  Remove all side branches 
except the top two or three. 
•  Prepare cuttings by trimming off the top to 
remove the terminal bud, allowing a majority of 
the energy in the stem to be sent to the lateral 
buds for root and shot development. 
•  Soak poles in water for at least 5 to 7 days before 
planting.  
•  Dig holes to the depth of the lowest anticipated 
water table.  Sites where the water table will be 
within one foot of the ground surface during the 
growing season are better suited for willows than 
cottonwoods. 
•  The cuttings should extend several inches into 
the permanent water table to ensure adequate 
moisture for sprouting.  At least 1/2 to 2/3 s of 
the cutting should be below ground to prevent 
the cutting from being ripped out during high 
flows.  Usually, at least 2 to 3 feet should be 
below ground.  It should also be long enough to 
emerge above adjacent vegetation such that it 
will not be shaded out. 
•  Place the cuttings in the holes the same day they 
were removed from the soak treatment.  Set the 
butt as close to the lowest annual water table 
elevation as possible. 
•  Electric hammer drills (Dewalt model DW530) 
fitted with one-inch diameter, 3-foot bits were 
used to plant thousands of willows in New 
Mexico.  With one drill, two people installed 500 
willow cuttings per day to a 3-foot depth.  A 
power auger or a punch bar can also be used. 
•  Willow pole cuttings were generally planted on 
10 to 20 foot centers in New Mexico.  Areas 
with a shallow water table (4-6 feet) were 
generally planted with a higher number of pole 
cuttings to enhance overall survival.  Often 
understory species were planted under the 
canopy of pre-existing overstory (cottonwoods, 
tree willows), since they are often observed 
occupying this niche. 
It is critical to ensure that the soil is packed 
around the cutting to prevent air pockets.  
&quot.Mudding&quot. (filling the hole with water and then 
adding soil to make mud slurry) can remove air 
pockets. 
• 
•  When necessary, install tree guards around the 
poles to protect from beavers, other rodents, or 
rabbits.  Willows tend to be fairly resistant to 
pruning from beavers, so tree guards may not be 
necessary. 
•  As buds begin to swell (usually in April or May), 
remove them from the lower two-thirds of the 
pole.  This will reduce evapo-transpiration water 
loss and stimulate root growth. 
•  Exclude the planting area from livestock grazing 
for at least two to three growing seasons. 
 
Seed Collections 
•  Willow seeds must be collected as soon as the 
capsules mature (when they turn from green to 
yellow or tan). 
•  Plant seeds immediately, since they retain their 
viability for only a few days at room 
temperature.  Even under the most favorable 
conditions, maximum storage is four to six 
weeks.  
•  Germination takes place 12 to 14 hours after 
planting.  Keep soil moist while seedlings 
germinate and grow.  
•  When seeding outdoors, willows require moist 
soil from spring over-bank flows, capillary

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='Traditional resource management of willow includes 
the following: 
•  Willows were traditionally tended by pruning or 
burning to produce long straight stems.  
•  Willow is gathered only at certain times of the 
year, beginning in the autumn after the leaves 
fall.  For many weavers, gathering will continue 
until the following spring when the sap begins to 
rise again.  
•  Often, basketweavers will prune many willows, 
sometimes replanting the stems, so there will be 
nice straight basketry materials the following 
year. 
•  Before gathering, the weavers make offerings of 
thanks and pray for permission to gather.  Often 
tobacco or other offerings are given before 
beginning to gather. 
•  Basket weavers process materials with their 
hands and mouths.  Herbicides sprayed on 
willows and along streams have a much higher 
health risk for humans when they are processed 
and used for traditional materials.  
 
Howe and Knopf (1991) conclude that to ensure the 
survival of willows and cottonwoods in riparian 
communities, resource managers need to implement 
strategies to control the spread of exotic species. 
 
Livestock grazing has widely been identified as a 
leading factor causing or contributing to degradation 
of riparian habitats in the western United States 
(Chaney et al. 1990, Fleischner 1994, Ohmart 1996).  
Livestock grazing can alter vegetative structure and 
composition of riparian habitat.  Overgrazing, 
 
 

Page 4
especially by livestock and big game, frequently 
changes plant species composition and growth form, 
density of stands, vigor, seed production of plants, 
and insect production.  Livestock grazing can cause 
the replacement of bird and mammal species 
requiring the vertical vegetation structure of riparian 
habitat to species, which are ubiquitous in their 
habitat preferences.  Previous heavy cattle grazing 
changed the bird and small mammal community 
composition in riparian areas through reduction of 
shrub and herbaceous cover. 
 
Slovlin (1984) recommended a 5-year rest from cattle 
grazing to re-establish healthy stands of riparian 
vegetation such as cottonwood and willows.  Siekert 
et al. (1985) reported that spring grazing showed no 
significant changes in channel morphology, whereas 
summer and fall grazing did.  However, even with 
limited seasonal grazing, all tree seedlings would be 
eliminated.  Marlow and Pogacnik (1985) 
recommended fencing riparian habitat, rest-rotation, 
light grazing (&lt.20% forage removal), and grazing 
after streambanks have dried to 10% moisture.

seeds were eaten by the Cahuilla to cure colds.  The 
Diegueño used white sage tea for this purpose.  
Leaves of white sage were smoked, made into a tea, 
and used in sweathouses to cure colds.  White sage 
leaves were also used by the Diegueño as a shampoo 
to clean their hair and to keep it from turning gray.  
Crushed leaves were rubbed on the body to eliminate 
body odor. this was often done by Cahuilla men 
before they went hunting.  The smoke from burning 
white sage is used widely by many Native groups as 
part of their purification ceremonies.  White sage is 
widely valued and cherished among many Indians 
and other cultures today, prized for its soft 
&quot.feminine&quot. qualities (Stevens, unpublished field 
notes, 1998). 
 
Today the leaves and stems of Salvia apiana are 
gathered, dried, and used for smudging by many 
tribes around the country.  The Chumash and other 
California Indian people are concerned about over-
harvesting and disrespect of this plant for commercial 
purposes.

good stomach tonic.  The lukewarm tea is sufficiently 
bacteriostatic and astringent to make it useful for 
treating nearly all sore throats, first gargled and then 
drunk.  The crushed leaves are made into a reliable 
uterine hemostatic tea, good for heavy menstruation 
but inadvisable for the new mother who plans to 
nurse. 
 
Wildlife: White sage is an important browse plant for 
deer, antelope, elk, mountain sheep, and rabbits.  The 
flowers attract hummingbirds, butterflies, bees, and 
other insects.  Small mammals, sparrows, grouse, and 
quail eat the seeds.  Salvia apiana is a beautiful low

Ethnobotanic: White sage seeds were one component 
in pinole, which was a staple food of the Indians of 
the Pacific coast (Barrows 1977).  Seeds were 
collected with a seed beater basket and flat basket, 
and were parched and ground into meal.  The 
Cahuillas of southern California used this meal to 
create a mix with one part meal, three parts wheat 
flour, and a little sugar.  This mixture was eaten dry, 
mixed with water to form gruel, or baked into little 
cakes or biscuits.  The seeds were harvested in 
quantity and stored in baskets in the home.  The 
tribes, north of Santa Barbara, kept small baskets of 
seeds and other foodstuffs on hand, with some stored 
for the winter.  The Chumash and other California 
tribes also ate leaves and stems of white sage.  
 
The Cahuilla, Costanoan, Diegeño, Kawaiisu, and 
Maidu tribes of California used white sage or chia 
seeds to clean and heal their eyes (Strike 1994).  One 
method was to place a few Salvia seeds in their eyes 
at bedtime.  During the night, the seeds would swell 
and become gelatinous.  Moving around under the 
eyelids during sleep, the seeds collected any foreign 
substances on the eyeballs.  In the morning the seeds 
were removed, leaving the eyes clear and free of 
contaminants.  Cahuilla women drank an infusion of 
white sage roots after giving birth to remove the 
afterbirth and promote internal healing.  White sage

Distribution 
For current distribution, please consult the Plant 
Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
site.  White sage generally occurs at elevations below 
1500 m.  It is common on dry slopes in coastal-sage 
scrub, chaparral, and yellow pine forests.  It occurs in 
the South Coast, Transverse Ranges, Peninsular 
Ranges, and the western edge of the Desert Province.  
Salvia apiana extends south from southern California 
to Baja California.' WHERE symbol='saap2';

Establishment 
Salvia apiana requires well-drained, fairly dry soils 
and full sun.  Excessive watering of white sage, 
especially during summer months, is likely to kill the 
plant.  White sage is particularly good for stabilizing 
or restoring disturbed or degraded areas.  Bart 
O’Brien, Director of Horticulture, Rancho Santa Ana 
Botanic Garden and Rick Hepting, Theatrum 
Botanicum, provided the following horticultural 
information: 
' WHERE symbol='saap2';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_ TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_='Seeds: Salvia apiana propagates more easily from 
seed than from cuttings.  Plant seeds in flats in an 
appropriate planting soil.  Seeds may respond to 
light, so plant seeds at the soil surface or plant 1/8&quot. to 
1/4&quot. in a well-drained soil mix.  Immediately after 
planting, soak flats thoroughly, and then water 
sparingly as needed.  Seeds germinate in 2-3 weeks at 
20 to 30° C (68 to 86° F).  Plant the seedlings into 2&quot. 
or 4&quot. pots after they grow 2-4 leaves beyond the 
cotyledons.  Water as needed, but do not overwater.  
Salvia apiana plants grow rapidly. they are usually 
ready to outplant in 6 months to a year.  It is best to 
outplant in the fall. don t plant in the summer. 
' WHERE symbol='saap2';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_ TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_='Cuttings: Gather soft wood cuttings of young 
vegetative shoots before the plant has flowered.  The 
rooting ability of these cuttings is enhanced by 
collection and preparation in the spring.  Collect 
cuttings 3-4 inches long, and remove the lowest pair 
of leaves.  Dipping the basal 1-2 inch portion of the 
cutting in rooting hormones enhances rooting.  Bury 
the cuttings so that the lowest node is ½ inch under 
ground.  Plants will root quickly if they are going to 
survive.  If the cutting material is too hard, rooting 
may take a long time, or cuttings won t ever root.  If 
the cutting material is too soft, it will rot.  It takes 
some experience to collect the cuttings at the right 
time.  Cuttings establish more readily if kept warm 
 
 
 
 
under the flats for weeks at 20 to 30° C (68 to 86° F). 
Once roots are established on cuttings, plant them in 
2&quot. or 4&quot. pots.  Pot them in bigger containers as the 
plants grow.  Salvia apiana grows rapidly, so it is 
usually ready to out-plant in 6 months to a year in 
southern California (warmer climates).  In northern 
California, out-plant when the plants are a year old 
because the winters are sometimes too severe for 
them.  It is best to outplant in the fall. don t plant in 
the summer.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='Horticultural management includes avoiding over-
watering seedlings and plants.  Plants will mildew if 
they experience excessive humidity or too much 
shade.  Aphids can be a problem for younger plants, 
particularly in the spring.  As the plants grow older, 
they are fairly resistant to herbivores. 
 
Traditional Resource Management: Traditional 
management of white sage includes the following: 
•  Pruning leaves and branches to stimulate new 
growth.   
•  Since this is a valued medicine plant, prayer, 
thanksgiving, and ceremony are important 
components of harvest and renewal.   
•  Burning occurred during September and October 
after seeds ripened.  Salvia species were burned 
for plant improvement by the Cupreño, 
Mountain Cahuilla, Northern Digueño, and 
Southern Digueño. 
•  Seeds were planted from wild plants.  A 
Diegueño woman reported her people always 
cleared a small spot near their dwelling to plant 
seeds of plants with greens, seeds, or roots. 
•  Ownership of seed-gathering grounds promoted 
long term care and sustainable harvest practices.

canes, lampposts, furniture, and candleholders 
(Viereck &amp. Little 1972).  The wood has also been 
used to make furniture, baskets, baseball bats, 
charcoal, and gunpowder. 
 
Wildlife: snowshoe hares, deer, elk, and moose 
browse Bebb willow.  The buds, shoots, and catkins 
are eaten by birds, beaver and small mammals. 
 
Agroforestry: Bebb willow is used in forested 
riparian buffers to help reduce stream bank erosion, 
protect aquatic environments, enhance wildlife, and 
increase biodiversity.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Description='General: Bebb willow (Salix bebbiana) is a large 
native shrub ten feet tall or a small bushy tree fifteen 
to twenty-five feet (Viereck &amp. Little 1972).  The 
leaves are elliptical to oblanceolate. one to three 
inches long, and are hairy when young smooth and 
strongly veined when old.  The fruit is capsules, six 
to eight millimeters long, long beaked, and sparsely 
hairy (Farrar 1995).  The bark is thin, reddish, olive-
green, or gray tinged with red and slightly divided by 
shallow fissures (Sargent 1961).  The roots are 
shallow and dense. 
 
Distribution: Bebb willow range from Alaska south 
to British Columbia to east Newfoundland and in 
northeast United States and upper mid-western 
United States.  For current distribution, please consult 
the Plant profile page for this species on the PLANTS 
Web site.

Bebb willow is adapted to a wide variety of soil 
textures.  It prefers moist sites and is drought tolerant.  
This species tolerates moderate alkaline soils but not 
extremely alkaline conditions.  It is frequently found 
in swamps, lakes, borders of streams, open woods 
and forests (Sargent 1961).  Bebb willow is a fast 
growing but short-lived species that occurs most 
commonly under shade of trees where the sites are 
poor (Viereck &amp. Little 1972).

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Propagation from Seed: Seeds must be sown as soon 
as they are ripe in the spring.  Seeds are viable for 
only a few days and the maximum storage period is 
four to six weeks with germination rates dropping off 
fast after ten days at room temperature (Dirr &amp. 
Heuser 1987).  Willow seeds have no dormancy and 
germinate within twelve to twenty-four hours after 
falling on moist ground (Ibid.).  Seedbeds must be 
kept moist until seedlings are well established. 
 
Propagation from Cuttings: Hardwood cuttings can 
be collected and prepared for insertion, normally 
from November through March.  Cuttings seven to 
ten inches long and a half to one inch thick are 
initially planted close in stool beds and dug after one 
year (Dirr &amp. Heuser 1987).  Willows have a rooting 
percentage of ninety to one-hundred percent and the 
rooting number is not promoted by rooting hormones

CHIA 
Salvia columbariae Benth. 
Plant Symbol = SACO6

Chia seeds are a valuable source of nutrients, protein 
and oil.  When roasted, they have a pleasant, nutlike 
flavor.  The Diegueño took chia seeds on journeys 
where a few seeds kept in the mouth and periodically 
chewed, would keep up their strength (Hedges &amp. 
Beresford 1986).  One tablespoon of chia seed is said 
to be enough to supply a person with 24 hours worth 
of energy.   
 
 The seeds were usually harvested by bending the 
stalks over a seed burden or gathering basket and 
beating the seeds out of the prickly, dry heads with a 
seedbeater.  Even though the seeds are tiny, in this 
way, several quarts could be gathered within a few 
hours.  The Cahuilla tribe of southern California 
would harvest the entire stalk and tie them into 
bundles (Romero 1954).   The bundles were then 
taken to a specially prepared clear, hard area of 
ground where the seeds were separated by thrashing 
the stalks with sticks and bare feet.  Baskets were 
used to fan away the chaff, leaving the seeds to be 
gathered.    
 
After hulling and winnowing, the seeds were stored 
underground for later use or were often parched with 
hot coals or pebbles in baskets or clay trays.  The 
seeds were pulverized in a bedrock mortar into a 
meal that was used to make biscuits, cakes, and a 
mush called pinole.  A porridge or soup was made by 
mixing the ground seeds with water and then cooking 
in a specially made watertight basket to which hot 
rock or stones were added.  Upon the arrival of wheat 
with the Europeans, the Cahuilla and other native 
peoples continued to grind chia along with the wheat 
berries (Barrow 1978).  Mason (1912) writes that the 
Salinan mixed chia with flour to make “tortillas, 
delicate and agreeable to the taste as if they had 
kneaded them with lard.”  The Diegueño would 
“improve the flavor” of a large quantity of wheat by 
adding only a small amount of chia (Hedges &amp. 
Beresford 1985).   
 
Chia seeds contain a musilagenous substance and 
expand considerably into a gelatinous volume when 
moistened.  An aromatic, minty beverage could be 
made by soaking raw chia seeds in water (Saunders 
1923).  Ground seeds were soaked in water to make a 
refreshing beverage that is said to have high thirst-
quenching properties.  Chia, used in this way, is also 
said to make the alkaline water of the desert 
palatable.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Uses='Ethnobotanic:  Chia, the Spanish name for Salvia 
columbariae, is a plant of great economic importance 
to many Native American tribes in California, who 
have long used chia for food and medicinal purposes.   
Historically, chia seeds were a staple food for many 
Pacific coast groups including the Salinan, Costanoan 
and Chumash as well as inland tribes such as the  
Paiute, Maidu, and Kawaiisu.   Chia is one of the first 
plants obtained by humans in Kawaiisu mythology 
(Zigmond 1981).  Chia was regularly cultivated along 
with corn in the fields of the Nahua peoples of 
ancient Mexico.  Salvia columbariae seeds were used 
by the Chumash on Santa Rosa Island, one of the 
Channel Islands off the coast of Southern California, 
as long as 600 years ago, as evidenced by radio 
carbon dating of seeds found in pottery jars at burial 
sites there (Clebsch 1997).  Large beds of chia plants 
are reported to bloom in areas that once were the 
locations of ancient Native American villages 
(Romero 1954).   Chia is an important resource that 
was often managed by native peoples.  The Chumash 
and Cahuilla were among those groups who would 
increase the following year’s harvest by periodically 
burning stands of chia plants (Timbrook et al. 
1982.Bean &amp. Saubel 1972).

Seeds mixed with water were also used to treat fevers 
(Bocek 1984).  A hot poultice of ground chia seeds 
was placed inside a cloth or bandage and applied to 
infected areas of the body.   Europeans quickly 
adapted medicinal uses of chia. early California 
mission fathers learned how to make an infusion 
from chia seeds to treat fevers and it is said that chia 
makes the “finest poultice for gunshot wounds” 
(Jepson 1911).   The Costanoan were among the 
many tribes who used chia seeds to remove foreign 
matter or reduce irritation of the eye (Bocek 1984).  
A single to several of the whole seeds were dropped 
into the eye, and rolled around or left in overnight.  
The Cahuilla tribe used chia seeds in this fashion to 
remove sand in the eyes acquired from sandstorms 
encountered after a long day of hunting (Romero 
1954).  Seeds were sometimes mashed with a rock or 
hammer and placed in the eye overnight (Zigmond 
1981).  The film that resulted from the gelatinous 
seeds in either method absorbed any foreign body or 
irritant and helped to ease inflammation.  Chia seeds 
were often used for ceremonial offerings (Timbrook 
1990).   
 
Other:  Chia is one of the traditional foods that is 
considered useful by researchers in treating diabetes, 
a disease that afflicts many modern Native 
Americans and may be attributed to the loss of many 
traditional foods (Lowry 1999).   
 
Wildlife:  Chia flowers are an important source of 
nectar for bees and butterflies.  Many species of 
birds, small mammals, and insects eat the seeds.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Description='General: Mint family (Lamiaceae). Chia is native to 
western North America.  The plants can vary greatly 
in size depending on moisture availability ranging, in 
both height and diameter, from 3 to 4 cm under very 
dry conditions to 60 cm under optimal conditions.  
The thick, wrinkled leaves (10 to 15 cm long) are 
dark green and deeply lobed with a thin covering of 
fine, soft, grayish hairs on the upper surface.   Leaves 
grow predominantly from the basal area of the plant 
with smaller leaves growing up the stems.  Several 
stems emerge from the base of the plant, each bearing 
from one to four interrupted (2 to 3 cm apart) button-
like whorls of tiny, tubular flowers (6-16mm).  The 
pale blue to deep blue flowers have two lips. the 
 
 
white-tipped lower lip is cleft into three lobes, with 
the central lobe slightly larger in size.  Several 
contrasting leafy, burgundy-colored bracts subtend 
the flower heads.   A spiny tip protrudes from a 
central notch in each bract.  Each flower results in up 
to 13 tiny, gray to light brown, flat seeds 1.5-2mm in 
length.   
 
Flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, from 
March through June in California.  As the season 
progresses, the blossoms dry and turn from clear blue 
to golden, and remain dry upon their stems.  The tiny 
seeds disperse by shaking out of the dry blossoms.   
 
Distribution: Chia’s native range extends through the 
coastal and inner coast ranges of California from 
Mendocino County in the north to Baja in the south.  
Chia grows throughout southern California and into 
adjacent areas of Nevada, Arizona, Utah, and 
Northwestern Mexico.  Chia was once more common 
in many of its native areas, but its populations have 
declined due to overgrazing, urban development, and 
fire suppression (Timbrook et al. 1982). 
 
For current distribution, please consult the Plant 
Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
site. 
 
Habitat:  Chia is a member of the foothill woodland, 
coastal sage scrub and chaparral communities in 
California, where it sometimes forms extensive 
stands (Bean &amp. Saubel 1972).  It can be found in the 
open, exposed grassy areas of woodlands, in sandy 
washes, dry, open plains, hillsides and gravelly, 
disturbed sites.  It is commonly found at elevations 
below 1200 meters but is known to grow in some 
areas up to 2100 meters (Munz &amp. Keck 1963).

chia near lawns and other plants that require frequent 
watering.   
 
Seeds may benefit from pretreatment, but this 
treatment may vary depending on the origin of the 
seeds (Emery 1998).  Ask your seed supplier as to 
their recommendations.  Broadcast the chia seeds in

autumn by sprinkling the seeds onto the surface of 
the soil.   Rake the seeds lightly into the soil.  A light 
sprinkling of charate (the charred remains of burned 
plants) over the sown seedbed has been shown to 
increase germination (Emery 1988).  Once 
established, Chia is quite drought tolerant.   The 
plants will tolerate some moisture during the growing 
period but should not be watered frequently.    
Remove weeds as they appear.   
 
If necessary, seeds may be planted in flats in the early 
spring and then transplanted later into a sunny, open 
area.  Fill flats with a light, porous soil.  Appropriate 
soils may be purchased or a homemade combination 
of equal portions of compost, garden loam and sand 
may be used.  Sprinkle the seeds evenly over the 
surface.  Cover with a fine layer of more soil not 
exceeding two times the diameter of the seed.  
Lightly press the surface to insure contact of the 
seeds with surrounding soil.   Use a fine spray nozzle 
to gently water the flats.   Keep the flats evenly moist 
and do not let them dry out. Reduce watering 
frequency after the seedlings emerge.

Medicinally, the Maidu of California used an 
infusion of arrowhead roots to clean and treat 
wounds.  The Navaho use these plants for headaches.  
The Ojibwa and the Chippewa used Sagittaria 
species as a remedy for indigestion.  The Cherokee 
used an infusion of leaves to bath feverish babies, 
with one sip given orally.  The Iroquois used wapato 
for rheumatism, a dermatological aid, a laxative, and 
as a ceremonial blessing when they began planting 
corn. 
 
Wildlife: The small, flattish seeds of arrowheads are 
eaten by ducks, and the tubers are valuable to many 
species of wildlife.  Muskrat and porcupine are 
known to eat the tubers  Swans, geese, wood ducks, 
blue-winged teal, lesser and greater scaup, ruddy 
duck, ring necked duck, pintail, mallard, mottled 
duck, gadwall, canvasback, black duck and king rail 
are known to eat arrowhead seeds and tubers (Martin 
1951).

Sagittaria cuneata is an aquatic plant growing in 
swampy ground or standing water in ponds, lakes, 
stream edges, and ditches (Hickman 1993).  Wapato 
have white or bluish tubers, which are edible.  The 
leaves are sagittate, with 5-15 cm long erect or 
floating leaf blades. the lower lobes of the emergent 
leaf blades are less than the terminal lobe.  The 
inflorescence is simple or branching, often with the 
lower flowers pistillate and the upper ones staminate.  
The flowers are white, with three white petals and 3 
sepals.  Stamens are numerous and bright yellow.  
The pistils are numerous, spirally arranged on the 
receptacle.  The fruit is a greenish colored achene.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Uses='Ethnobotanic: Sagittaria is an aquatic plant with 
tuberous roots that can be eaten like potatoes.  The 
tubers of Sagittaria species were eaten by many 
different Indigenous groups in Canada, as well as 
many groups of Washington and Oregon (Kuhnlein 
and Turner 1991).  The tubers were widely traded 
from harvesting centers to neighboring areas.  On the 
Lower Columbia in Chinook Territory, Katzie 
families owned large patches of the wapato plants.  
Family groups camped beside their harvesting sites 
for a month or more. 
 
Indian women collected wapato in shallow water 
from a canoe, or waded into ponds or marshes in the 
late summer and loosened the roots with their toes.  
The roots would rise to the top of the water where 
they were gathered and tossed into floating baskets.  
Today, the tubers are harvested with a hoe, pitchfork, 
or rake.  Tubers are baked in fire embers, boiled, or 
roasted in the ashes.  Tubers are skinned and eaten 
whole or mashed.  After cooking, some tubers were 
dried and stored for winter use.  The Chippewa 
gathered the &quot.Indian potatoes&quot. in the fall, strung 
them, and hung them overhead in the wigwam to dry.  
Later, they were boiled for use.

ditches and freshwater wetlands.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Sagittaria species may be planted from bare root 
stock, by transplanting the tubers, and by seeding 
directly into wetland soil.  Live plant transplants or 
transplanting tubers are preferred revegetation 
methods where there is moving water.  It takes two 
years for seed to germinate. planting bare root stock 
or tubers gives faster revegetation results. 
 
Live Plant Collections: No more than 1/4 of the 
plants in an area should be collected.  A depth of 15 
cm (6 in) is sufficiently deep for digging plugs.  This 
will leave enough plants and rhizomes to grow back 
during the growing season. 
 
Wild plants should be collected from the time leaves 
emerge in spring until first frost. Plants can be pulled 
up easily from wet soil.  When collecting wild plants, 
rinse roots gently.  Leaves and stems can be clipped 
from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 inches). this allows the 
plant to allocate more energy into root production.  
The roots should always remain moist or in water 
until planted.  Plants should be transported and stored 
in a cool location prior to planting.  Water depth 
should be 0 to 6&quot. and the soils should be wet.  
 
Sagittaria grows prolifically around ponds or 
wetlands in shallow water.  Plug spacing of 25-30 cm 
will fill in within one growing season.  Soil should be 
kept saturated, with approximately 1 cm of water 
over the surface of the soil after planting.  If water is 
low in nutrients (oligotrophic), fertilization will speed 
biomass production and revegetation.  Many surface 
waters are already rich in nutrients (eutrophic), and 
fertilization is not necessary. 
 
Transplanting tubers: Transplant success may be 
greater with the tubers than with bare root stock.  The 
little underground potatoes can be separated from the 
parent plants with a rake, hoe, or shovel.  In 
unconsolidated soils, the tubers can be pulled up by 
hand by searching around the roots of the plant. 
 
After collecting, the Sagittaria tubers should be kept 
moist and cool, and stored in peat moss.  Wapato 
tubers are then planted in shallow water, in the same 
conditions as described above for the whole plants.  
Tubers should be collected and planted when plants 
are dormant, in the fall, winter and early spring. 
 
 
 
Seeds: Seeds of Sagittaria species take two years to 
germinate, because they have a double dormancy 
requiring cold then warm then cold temperatures.  
Temperature has a multiple role in the regulation of 
timing of germination.  Dormant seeds become 
nondormant only at specific temperatures, non-
dormant seeds have specific temperature 
requirements for germination, and nondormant seeds 
of some species are induced into dormancy by certain 
temperatures.  Once Sagittaria seeds germinate, they 
have fairly high viability.  
 
Procedures for growing Sagittaria seeds in the 
greenhouse have not been developed at this time. 
however, Sagittaria seeds can be planted directly in 
wetlands or ponds.  Prepare the area by creating a 
washboard in shallow water, at mudflat consistency.  
Seeds should then be scattered on the surface of the 
soil, as the seeds need sunlight to germinate well.  
Light and temperature in natural conditions will 
promote seed germination, and in two years 
Sagittaria plants will emerge.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='Hydrology is the most important factor in 
determining wetland type, revegetation success, and 
wetland function and value.  Changes in water levels 
influence species composition, structure, and 
distribution of plant communities.  Water 
management is absolutely critical during plant 
establishment, and remains crucial through the life of 
the wetland for proper community management.  
Sagittaria species require moist soils to standing 
water for successful revegetation. 
 
Muskrats have evolved with wetland ecosystems and 
form a valuable component of healthy functioning 
wetland communities.  Muskrat eat-outs increase 
wetland diversity by opening up the dense tule and 
cattail stands, and providing opportunities for aquatic 
vegetation, such as Sagittaria to become established 
in the open water.  Muskrat huts provide a substrate 
for shrubs and other plant species.  Caches of 
Sagittaria tubers stored by muskrat and beaver were 
often sought by Indian people. 
 
We have no record of specific traditional resource 
management techniques other than anecdotal 
information of the use of fire to keep dense tule 
marshes open, which provided an opportunity for 
colonization and spread of Sagittaria species.  The 
harvest of arrowhead was usually made in late 
summer as the stems and leaves were dying (and 
usually when the water table was lower) (Balls 1962).

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Uses='Ethnobotanic: The value of willow as the raw 
material necessary for the manufacture of a family s 
household goods cannot be over-estimated.  Among 
the Paiute, every woman carried bundles of long, 
slender willow which had been scraped white, and 
coils of willow sapwood that she had gathered and 
prepared during the winter months when the leaves 
were gone (Wheat 1967).  Willow branches are used 
as the warp for twined baskets and the foundation in 
coiled baskets.  Willows are used to weave water 
jugs, cradles for newborn infants, hats, cooking 
vessels, serving bowls, trays, seed beaters, and 
storage baskets.  Some tribes use willow roots as a 
sewing strand.  Virtually all California tribes use 
willow in their baskets. 
 
Tribes which use willow, such as Salix exigua, 
include the Chemehuevi, Paiute, Mono, Panamint, 
Pviotso (Northern Paiute), Shoshoni, Bannock, Ute, 
Washo, Chiricahua, Jicarilla Apache, Mescalero 
Apache, Navajo, San Carlos Apache, Western 
Apache, White Mountain Apache, Havasupai, 
Maricopa, Yavapai, Hopi, San Juan Pueblo (Tewa), 
Zuni, Papago, and Pima Indians extending through 
the American Southwest and Mexico.  In Ancestral 
Puebloan times, willow, along with threeleaf sumac, 
                          Plant Guide  
 
was the material of choice for manufacturing Native 
American baskets. 
 
Willow is gathered from the time the leaves fall in 
autumn until the buds begin to swell in spring.  The 
year-old wands without branches are chosen, and 
sorted by size and length.  The bark can easily be 
stripped off in the spring when the sap rises.  Willow 
wands with the smallest leaf scars are split and peeled 
to obtain the tough, flexible sapwood used for the 
weft in basket weaving.  Color variation is achieved 
by alternating peeled and unpeeled willow sticks in 
the warp.  Ute Indians used to concoct a green dye 
for coloring buckskin by soaking willow leaves in hot 
water and then boiling the mixture to concentrate the 
pigment.  Willow roots also have been used by others 
to manufacture a rose-tan dye. 
 
The Paiute built willow-frame houses covered with 
mats of cattails or tules.  Slender willow withes were 
woven into tight circular fences as protection from 
the wind that blew sand into eyes and food.  For 
shade, shed roofs thatched with willows, called 
&quot.willow shadows&quot., were constructed.  In the Pueblo 
province, coyote willow branches are employed with 
leaves attached for thatching roofs.  Other light 
construction uses included the tops of storage bins or 
racks for aerating corn while it dried, such as one 
recently unearthed at prehistoric Arroyo Hondo 
Pueblo. 
 
A bed or sleeping bench of willow poles raised high 
off the ground indicated a wealthy man in the Miwok 
culture in California s Sierra Nevada.  Willow brush 
was placed radically over the roof timbers of an earth 
lodge.  Boats had eight willow ribs and a gunwale of 
willow pole along each side.  Sweat lodges are made 
with willow.  A women’s shinney game was played 
on a field similar to a football field with five-foot 
long, sharp willow poles.  A ring of rope or string 
was thrown into an indent in the field and the women 
had to move it up the field and throw it against a goal 
post without touching or carrying it on the poles.  
Counting games are played with willow counting 
sticks. 
 
Ancestral Puebloans used willow wood for textile 
loom anchors, rods to control the weaving rhythm, 
and finishing needles.  Bows, arrow points, pot rests, 
scrapers and cradle parts all were crafted from 
willow.  In later times, Navajo made weaving sticks 
and arrow shafts from willow along with other

straight-grained woods, and Ute Indians made 
snowshoe frames from dried willow branches.  
Matting was another early product made from 
willows.   
 
Other implements made from willow include fire 
sticks twirled as a spindle to generate enough heat to 
ignite a flame and what appear to be prayer sticks 
recovered from various archaeological sites.  Willow 
is still used for making prayer sticks by the Zunis and 
doubtless by some of the Rio Grande pueblo.  Inner 
bark was used in spring for rope in California 
(Murphey 1959). 
 
Aspirin is the pharmaceutical equivalent of willow 
bark tea, which is an effective remedy for headache, 
fever or sore throat.  More than 2,400 years ago, the 
Greeks learned to use extracts of several native 
willow species to treat pain, gout, and other illnesses.  
In more recent times, in 1839, salicylic acid was 
isolated from wild plants and manufactured 
synthetically.  Early salicylic acid-based products had 
unpleasant side effects.  Sixty years later, the Bayer 
Company developed a derivative of salicylic acid, 
called it aspirin, and the rest is history. 
 
Tea made from willow leaves will cure laryngitis.  
Willow reduces inflammation of joints and 
membranes.  When used as an analgesic, willow 
treats urethra and bladder irritation, infected wounds, 
and eczema.  Willow is used as an over-all treatment 
of many diseases, including hay fever, diarrhea, 
prostatitis, satyriasis, and relief of ovarian pain.  A 
poultice is made for treating gangrene and skin 
ulcers.  For one remedy used by the Paiute, burned 
willow charcoal was added to water and taken as a 
tea to stop diarrhea.  A San Juan tribal elder said he 
used willow leaves to make his mouth water and 
relieve thirst. 
 
Young willow shoots can be stripped of their bark 
and eaten.  The inner bark can be eaten raw, prepared 
like spaghetti, or made into a flour.  The young 
leaves may be eaten in case of emergency 
 
Other Uses: Ecological diversity, bank and sediment 
stabilization, maintenance of channel morphology, 
water quality improvement, ground-water recharge, 
flood abatement, fish and wildlife habitat, ribs of 
boats, and games. 
 
Riparian Ecosystem Services and Functions: The 
riparian zone essentially encompasses those alluvial 
sediment deposits where river and alluvial ground 
water supplement that available from local 
precipitation.  High-to-low elevations, north-south 
 
 
and east-west gradients, and steep-to-shallow terrain 
all influence the relationship between geomorphic 
and fluvial processes and vegetation community 
structure.  Riparian ecosystem functions include the 
following: 
•  Ecological diversity. 
•  Riparian vegetation traps sediments and nutrients 
from surface runoff and prevents them from 
entering the aquatic system. 
•  Dense matrix of roots in the riparian zone can 
serve as an effective filter of shallow 
groundwater. 
•  Water quality is improved through filtration and 
trapping of sediment, nutrients (particularly 
nitrogen dissolved in groundwater), and 
pollutants. 
•  Riparian vegetation tends to prevent the river 
from down-cutting or cutting a straight path 
(channeling), thus promoting a sinuous course, 
ground-water recharge, and maintenance of an 
elevated water table. 
•  Riparian areas act as a sponge by absorbing 
floodwaters which is then slowly released over a 
period of time, which minimizes flood damage 
and sustains higher base flows during late 
summer. 
•  Structurally complex riparian vegetation 
communities provide many different habitats and 
support a diverse array of animal species.  
Different groups of animals occupy or use the 
different layers of vegetation, and this multi-
story arrangement is often present nowhere else 
in the arid landscapes. 
•  Canopies of plants growing on streambanks 
provide shade, cooling stream water, while roots 
stabilize and create overhanging banks, 
providing habitat for fish and other aquatic 
organisms. 
 
Wildlife: Rabbits and many ungulates, including deer, 
moose, and elk, browse on willow twigs, foliage and 
bark (Martin 1951).  Beavers consume willow 
branches, while several species of birds eat willow 
buds and young twigs.  
 
California s riparian forests support a high diversity 
of breeding birds (Miller 1951).  In one study 
conducted on the Sacramento River, 147 bird species 
were recorded as nesters or winter visitants’ (Laymon 
1985).  The percentage of breeding individuals that 
are migratory is very high in the cottonwood-willow 
habitat.  Moister conditions in the cottonwood-willow 
forest may promote lusher plant growth, higher 
invertebrate populations and, therefore, more 
available food for flycatchers, warblers and other 

Page 3
migratory, insectivorous birds.  Riparian areas 
support up to 10.6 times the density of migrant birds 
per hectare as adjacent non-riparian areas (Stevens et 
al. 1977).  Most of these migratory birds belong to 
the foliage insect (47%) or air insect (34%) foraging 
guilds. 
 
Coyote willow is browsed avidly by deer and to some 
extent by sheep, goats, and cattle, in summer and 
early fall.  Cattle will leave the willow patches when 
the foliage matures and dries, whereas deer devour 
the current leafless stem throughout the winter.  The 
browse rating for willow is good to fair for sheep and 
goats. good to poor for cattle. fair for deer. and fair to 
useless for horses (Sampson et al. 1981). 
 
Livestock: Riparian ecosystems offer water, shade, 
and food for domestic livestock.  Cattle and sheep 
congregate in riparian areas, particularly during hot 
or dry periods.  Overgrazing of domestic livestock in 
riparian areas destroys riparian ground cover, disrupts 
the reproductive cycle of cottonwood trees, 
destabilizes streambanks, and thus increases sediment 
loads to streams.

linear, with an acuminate leaf tip and either a serrate 
or entire leaf edge.  Coyote willow is a shrub &lt. 7 m 
tall, and spreads clonally by root-sprouting.  The 
catkin inflorescence appears with or after the leaves 
in the spring, and are 22-70 mm long on leafy shoots 
5-110 mm long.  The flower bracts are a tawny 
yellow color.

North America, and south to Arizona and Mexico 
(Hickman (1993).  Mason (1957) says Salix exigua is 
often found at sites of former Indian habitation, and

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Adaptation: Coyote willow dominates the riparian 
forests of lower terrace deposits and stabilized gravel 
bars.  Willows are found near water. they require a 
bare gravel or sand substrate with adequate moisture 
for germination and development.  Willows grow 
very rapidly when their roots are in contact with the 
permanent water table. 
 
Typically, in California, cottonwoods and willows 
predominate on the immediate stream banks, whereas 
valley oaks are spread irregularly over the natural 
levees farther away from stream banks.  In other parts 
of the American west, temporal gradients occur 
within a location in the riparian zone.  Early pioneer 
communities such as cottonwood/willow give way to 
late successional communities such as mesquite or 
sagebrush, often a consequence of sediment 
accumulation (Patten 1998).  Many similarities 
among western riparian ecosystems exist because 
several dominant genera (e.g. Populus and Salix spp.) 
are common throughout the West, and many 
geomorphic and hydrologic processes that influence 
riparian establishment are similar.  
 
Western riparian ecosystems have been greatly 
altered by human activity.  Riparian forests have been 
reduced to fragmented, discontinuous patches 
because of human intervention.  For example, 
estimates are that 70 - 90 percent of the natural 
riparian ecosystems in the U.S. have been lost to 
human activities (Warner 1979).  Regional losses in 
these ecosystems have been estimated to exceed 98% 
in the Sacramento Valley in California (Smith 1977) 
and 95% in Arizona (Warner 1979).  Many factors 
have contributed to these resource losses, including 
the following: natural resource use. urbanization. 
alteration of stream flows through dam construction 
and ground-water withdrawal. modification of biotic 
conditions through grazing, agriculture, and 
introduction of non-native species. and alteration 
within watersheds (Patten 1998). 
 
Coyote willow roots freely from cuttings, and is an 
easy species to propagate.  Coyote willow is a shrub 
3 to 15 feet in height with multiple branches and 
deciduous leaves.  Its architecture is resilient to 
disturbance such as high velocity floodwaters, 
sediment deposition, medium to high flooding 
(anoxic conditions), high winds, heavy precipitation, 
or pruning from beaver, deer or wildlife.  Beaver 
browsed more than 5,000 willow cuttings to ground 
level in New Mexico, and all the willow resprouted 
(Los Lunas Plant Materials Center 1998).  These

It is essential to monitor the water tables at 
cutting also survived over two months of continuous 
inundation.  
 
The NRCS Plant Materials Center at Los Lunas in 
cooperation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
developed a pole planting technique for establishing 
willow and cottonwood (USDA, NRCS).  We reprint 
this procedure below. 
• 
&quot.Trial planting on well adapted sites indicate 
more that 80% survival of cottonwood and willow 
poles when dormant poles are cut and planted 
between November and February. 
• 
proposed planting sites for at least one year before 
planting.  Poles planted where the water table 
fluctuates widely will have lower survival rates than 
those planted where water table is relatively stable.  
If groundwater monitoring shows the water level will 
drop more than 3 feet during the growing season 
(May-October), another site should be selected.  
Monitoring of observation wells for at least one 
calendar year before planting will allow better 
planting depth to ensure establishment.  
•  Salt cedar (Tamarix chinensis), Russian olive 
(Eleagnus angustifolia), and giant reed (Arundo 
donax) will need to be controlled before poles are 
planted.  However, young cottonwoods and willows 
can grow successfully in quite small openings in 
stands of salt cedar.  Study of natural stands suggest 
they will eventually shade out the salt cedar.&quot. 
 
Steps for Successful Pole Plantings: 
•  Select sites as close to the area as possible to 
conserve genetic diversity.  Try to match donor site 
and revegetation site in terms of soils, elevation, 
hydro-dynamics, permanent groundwater table, and 
soil salinity (which should be low).  
•  Select willow cuttings from a local, native stand 
in healthy condition.  Prune no more than 2/3 of 
plants in an area.  Willow cuttings for pole plantings 
should generally be at least 1/2 inch in diameter or 
larger.  Select the longest, straightest poles available.  
Use only two to four-year old wood.  The total length 
of the poles needed depends upon the water table 
depth (see #7 below). 
•  Measure water table fluctuations for at least 1 
year, preferably longer, to determine the lowest water 
table depth.  Take a reading at least once a month, 
preferably more often during the driest months of the 
year.  
•  Cut poles while dormant during January and 
February.  Remove all side branches except the top 
two or three. 
•  Prepare cuttings by trimming off the top to 
remove the terminal bud, allowing a majority of the 
 
 
energy in the stem to be sent to the lateral buds for 
root and shot development. 
•  Soak poles in water for at least 5 to 7 days before 
planting.  
•  Dig holes to the depth of the lowest anticipated 
water table.  Sites where the water table will be 
within one foot of the ground surface during the 
growing season are better suited for willows than 
cottonwoods. 
•  The cuttings should extend several inches into 
the permanent water table to ensure adequate 
moisture for sprouting.  At least 1/2 to 2/3 of the 
cutting should be below ground to prevent the cutting 
from being ripped out during high water flows.  
Usually, at least 2 to 3 feet should be below ground.  
It should also be long enough to emerge above 
adjacent vegetation such that it will not be shaded 
out. 
•  Place cuttings in the hole the same day they are 
removed from the soak treatment.  Set the butt as 
close to the lowest annual water table elevation as 
possible. 
•  Electric hammer drills (Dewalt model DW530) 
fitted with one-inch diameter, 3-foot bits were used to 
plant thousands of coyote willows in New Mexico.  
With one drill, two people installed 500 willow per 
day to a 3-foot depth.  A power auger or a punch bar 
can also be used. 
•  Coyote willow pole cuttings were generally 
planted on 10 to 20 foot centers in New Mexico.  
Areas with a shallow water table (4-6 feet) were 
generally planted with a higher number of pole 
cuttings to enhance overall survival of the project. in 
this case, coyote willow was planted on 1-foot 
centers or even closer.  Often understory species were 
planted under the canopy of pre-existing overstory 
(cottonwoods, tree willows) since they are often 
observed occupying this niche. 
• 
the cutting to prevent air pockets.  &quot.Mudding&quot. (filling 
the hole with water and then adding soil to make a 
mud slurry) can remove air pockets. 
•  When necessary, install tree guards around the 
poles to protect from beavers, other rodents, or 
rabbits.  Coyote willows tend to be fairly resistant to 
pruning from beavers, so tree guards may not be 
necessary. 
•  As buds begin to swell (usually in April or May), 
wipe them off the lower two-thirds of the pole.  This 
will reduce evapotranspiration water loss and 
stimulate root growth. 
•  Exclude the planting area from livestock grazing 
for at least two to three growing seasons. 
 
It is critical to ensure the soil is packed around

There are other techniques for stabilization of banks 
and erosion control, called bioengineering, which 
utilize coyote willows.  These include brush layers, 
brush mattresses, brush or tree revetments, brush 
trenches, vertical bundles, and willow wattles.  Often 
fiberschine, erosion control fabric and hay bales are 
utilized to stabilize an eroding site.  For further 
information on these techniques, refer to The 
Practical Streambank Bioengineering Guide by 
USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service 
(Bentrup and Hoag 1998).   
 
Establishment From Seed: Willow seeds must be 
collected as soon as the capsules mature (when they 
turn from green to yellow) and planted immediately 
since they retain their viability for only a few days at 
room temperature.  Even under the most favorable 
conditions, maximum storage is four to six weeks.  
No dormancy occurs, so germination takes place 12 
to 14 hours after planting if the seeds are kept 
constantly moist willows are difficult to propagate in 
quantity by seed. 
 
Willows root so readily by either stem or root 
cuttings that there is little need to use other methods.  
Hardwood cuttings planted in early spring root 
promptly. 
 
For natural seed revegetation, coyote willow requires 
moist soil from spring over-bank flows or capillary 
wetting of the soil surface for establishment.  A 
number of studies have related components of the 
reproductive cycle of Salix species to floodplain site 
conditions produced by streamflow and associated 
fluvial processes.  In particular, components of the 
annual pattern of streamflow, or annual hydrograph, 
are associated with specific stages of Salix seedling 
emergence and growth.  These include the following: 
1) flood flows that precede Salix seed dispersal 
produce suitable germination sites. 2) flow recessions 
following a peak expose germination sites and 
promote seedling root elongation. and 3) base flows 
supply soil moisture to meet summer and winter 
seedling water demand (Shafroth et al. 1998. 
Mahoney et al. 1998).  The combination of root 
growth and capillary fringe defines the successful 
recruitment band for seedling establishment, which is 
usually from about 0.6 to 2 m in elevation above the 
late summer stream stage (Mahoney et al. 1998).  The 
rate of stream stage decline is also critical for 
seedling survival and should not exceed 2.5 cm per 
day.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='Traditional Resource Management: Willow is 
nature’s healer.  Poles of willow readily sprout, and 
 
 
help to stabilize stream banks and provide habitat.  
Sweat lodges constructed of willow have been known 
to sprout and grow, even though the willows were 
subjected to very high heat.  
 
Willows were traditionally tended by pruning, to 
produce long straight stems.  Willow is gathered only 
at certain times of the year, beginning in the autumn 
after the leaves fall.  For many weavers, gathering 
will continue until the following spring when the sap 
begins to rise again.  Some gatherers, once they find 
a good stand, will cut as much as they can.  The 
willows in many areas have not been tended in a long 
time, and the stems are old, woody, and twisted.  
Often basket weavers will prune many willows, 
sometimes replanting the stems, so there will be nice 
straight basketry materials the following year. 
 
The Chemehuevi gather shoots, which they have 
burned several times, until only the living stumps of 
the willow, remain (Collings 1979).  Straight young 
shoots grow from these stumps in profusion.  Each 
twig is carefully selected.  Those finally selected are 
at least fifteen inches long and between 1/8 and 3/16 
of an inch in diameter with as little taper from end to 
end as possible.  
 
Before gathering, the weavers I have interviewed 
make offerings of thanks and pray for permission to 
gather (Stevens, unpublished field notes, 1998).  
Often tobacco or other offerings are given before 
beginning to gather. 
 
Basket weavers process materials with their hands 
and mouths.  Herbicides sprayed on willows and 
along streams have a much higher health risk for 
humans when they are used for traditional materials.  
A Washoe basket weaver says, “Sometimes when 
you take the willows  skins off, they have spots from 
pesticides.”  Another weaver says the plants then 
grow deformed. the shoots don t grow straight and 
the willows are bumpy and wormy inside (Fulkerson 
1995). 
 
Howe and Knopf (1991) conclude that to ensure the 
survival of willows and cottonwoods in riparian 
communities, resource managers need to implement 
strategies to control the spread of exotic species. 
 
Livestock grazing has widely been identified as a 
leading factor causing or contributing to degradation 
of riparian habitats in the western United States (U.S. 
General Accounting Office 1988. Chaney et al. 1990, 
Fleischner 1994, Ohmart 1996).  Livestock grazing 
can alter vegetative structure and composition of 
riparian habitat.  Overgrazing, especially by livestock 

Page 6
and big game, frequently changes plant species 
composition and growth form, density of stands, 
vigor, seed production of plants, and insect 
production.  Livestock grazing can cause the 
replacement of bird and mammal species requiring 
the vertical vegetation structure of riparian habitat to 
species, which are ubiquitous in their habitat 
preferences. 
 
Slovlin (1984) recommended a 5-year rest from cattle 
grazing to re-establish healthy stands of riparian 
vegetation, such as cottonwood and willows.  Siekert 
et al. (1985) reported that spring grazing showed no 
significant changes in channel morphology, whereas 
summer and fall grazing did.  However, even with 
limited seasonal grazing, all tree seedlings would be 
eliminated.  Marlow and Pogacnik (1985) 
recommended fencing riparian habitat, rest-rotation, 
light grazing (&lt.20% forage removal), and grazing 
after streambanks have dried to 10% moisture.

PRAIRIE WILLOW 
In more recent times, in 1839, salicylic acid was 
isolated from wild plants and manufactured 
synthetically.  Early salicylic acid-based products had 
unpleasant side effects. Sixty years later, the Bayer 
Company developed a derivative of salicylic acid, 
called it aspirin, and the rest is history. 
 
Tea made from willow leaves will cure laryngitis.  
Willow reduces inflammation of joints and 
membranes (Moore 1979).  When used as an 
analgesic, willow treats urethra and bladder irritation, 
infected wounds, and eczema.  Willow is used as an 
over-all treatment of many diseases, including hay 
fever, diarrhea, prostatitis, satyriasis, and as a relief 
of ovarian pain.  A poultice is made for treating 
gangrene and skin ulcers.  
 
Young willow shoots can be stripped of their bark 
and eaten.  The young leaves may be eaten in case of 
emergency.  The inner bark can be eaten raw, 
prepared like spaghetti, or made into flour. 
 
Riparian: Riparian ecosystem functions provided by 
prairie willow include the following: 1) Riparian 
vegetation traps sediments and nutrients from surface 
runoff and prevents them from entering the aquatic 
system. 2) the dense matrix of roots in the riparian 
zone can serve as an effective filter of shallow 
groundwater. 3) water quality is improved through 
filtration and the trapping of sediment, nutrients 
(particularly nitrogen dissolved in groundwater), and 
pollutants. and 4) riparian areas act as a sponge by 
absorbing floodwaters.  The water is then slowly 
released over a period of time, which minimizes 
flood damage and sustains higher base flows during 
late summer. 
 
Wildlife: Structurally complex riparian vegetation 
communities provide many different habitats and 
support a diverse array of animal species.  The 
multiple layers of vegetation provide multiple niches 
for many species of insects and wildlife canopies of 
plants growing on streambank provide shade, cooling 
stream water, while roots stabilize and create 
overhanging banks, providing habitat for fish and 
other aquatic organisms. 
 
Rabbits and many ungulates (including deer, moose, 
and elk) browse on willow twigs, foliage, and bark 
(Martin 1951).  Beaver love willow branches.  
Several species of birds eat willow buds and young 
twigs.  Riparian forests support a high diversity of

baskets, drums, stirrups, tipi pegs and pins, fox and 
fish traps, hunting lodge poles, and meat-drying racks 
(Kindscher 1992).  Willows were and still are used 
for baskets throughout their range.  The Paiute, Ute, 
Shoshone, Hopi, Havasupai, Mandan, Cheyenne, 
Arapaho, Kiowa, and others use Salix lucida for 
basketweaving (James 1972, Mason 1988). 
 
Kelly Kindscher(1992) wrote in Medicinal Wild 
Plants of the Prairie: &quot.The Blackfeet made a tea from 
the fresh root of Salix species to treat internal 
hemorrhage, throat constrictions, swollen neck 
glands, and bloodshot or irritated eyes.  The twigs 
were also gathered and preserved.  Steeped in boiling 
water, they were made into a tea to cure fever or 
alleviate pain.&quot. 
 
Salix species were used as chew sticks to clean teeth 
by many other Indian tribes, including the Choctaw, 
Delaware, and Cheyenne.  The prairie willow was 
favored by the Osage, Delaware, and Cherokee for 
this purpose (Elvin-Lewis 1979).  The Kiowa made a 
tea of willow leaves, which they rubbed on the body 
to cure pneumonia and relieve rheumatic aches.  
They also chewed the bark to relieve toothaches 
(Vestal and Shultes 1939).  The Comanche burned 
the stems of the willow and used the ashes to treat 
sore eyes (Carlson and Jones 1939).  To restore 
themselves both physically and mentally, the Dakota 
drank a willow-bark tea (Andros 1883).  The Ojibwe  
used prairie willow bark externally to treat skin 
rashes. 
 
Aspirin is the pharmaceutical equivalent of willow 
bark tea, which is an effective remedy for headache, 
fever or sore throat.  More than 2,400 years ago, the 
Greeks learned to use extracts of several native 
willow species to treat pain, gout, and other illnesses.

breeding birds (Miller 1951).  The percentage of 
breeding individuals, which are migratory, is very 
high in the cottonwood-willow habitat.  Moister 
conditions in the cottonwood-willow forest may 
promote lusher plant growth, higher invertebrate 
populations and, therefore, more available food for 
flycatchers, warblers, and other migratory, 
insectivorous birds.  Riparian areas support up to 
10.6 times the density of migrant birds per hectare as 
adjacent non-riparian areas (Stevens et al. 1977).  
Most of these migratory birds belong to the foliage 
insect (47%) or air insect (34%) foraging guilds.

is a colonial shrub as tall as 3m (10 feet) (McGregor 
et al. 1986, Stephens 1973).  The young branches are 
yellow beneath the gray pubescence.   Leaves are 
alternate, simple, lance-shaped, 6-10 cm (2.4-3.9 in) 
long.  Leaves are dark green and usually glabrous 
above and densely short-hairy beneath, with the 
golden yellow veins raised prominently on the lower 
surface.  Plants bloom from April to May and fruit in 
early June.  Catkins emerge before the leaves.  The 
pistillate (female) catkins are sessile, 1-4 cm (0.4-1.6 
in) long, and ovoid-conic.  The small, hairy capsules 
are 4-6 mm (1/4 in) long.  When ripe, they open to

The NRCS, Plant Materials Center, Los Lunas, New 
Mexico, in cooperation with the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service, developed a pole planting technique 
for establishing willow (Hoag 1993a).  We reprint 
this procedure below.  &quot.Trial planting on well adapted 
sites indicate more that 80% survival of cottonwood 
 
 
and willow poles when dormant poles are cut and 
planted between November and February.  It is 
essential to monitor the water tables at proposed 
planting sites for at least one year before planting.  
Poles planted where the water table fluctuates widely 
will have lower survival rates than those planted 
where water table is relatively stable.  If groundwater 
monitoring shows the water level will drop more than 
3 feet during the growing season (May-October), 
another site should be selected.  Monitoring of 
observation wells for at least one calendar year 
before planting will allow better planting depth to 
ensure establishment.&quot.  
 
Steps for Successful Pole Plantings 
•  Select collection sites as close to the area as 
possible to conserve genetic diversity.  Try to 
match donor site and revegetation site in terms of 
soils, elevation, hydro-dynamics, permanent 
groundwater table, and soil salinity (which 
should be low).  
•  Select willow cuttings from a local, native stand 
in healthy condition.  Prune no more than 2/3 of 
plants in an area.  Willow cuttings for pole 
plantings should generally be at least 1/2 inch in 
diameter or larger.  Select the longest, straightest 
poles available.  Use only two to four-year old 
wood.  The total length of the poles needed 
depends upon the water table depth. 
•  Measure water table fluctuations in the planting 
area for at least 1 year, preferably longer, to 
determine the lowest water table depth.  Take a 
reading at least once a month, preferably more 
often during the driest months of the year.  
•  Cut poles while dormant.  Remove all side 
branches except the top two or three. 
•  Prepare cuttings by trimming off the top to 
•  Dig holes to the depth of the lowest anticipated 
water table.  Sites where the water table will be 
within one foot of the ground surface during the 
growing season are better suited for willows than 
cottonwoods. 
•  The cuttings should extend several inches into 
the permanent water table to ensure adequate 
moisture for sprouting.  At least 1/2 to 2/3 s of 
the cutting should be below ground to prevent 
the cutting from being ripped out during high 
flows.  Usually, at least 2 to 3 feet should be 
below ground.  It should also be long enough to 
remove the terminal bud, allowing a majority of 
the energy in the stem to be sent to the lateral 
buds for root and shot development. 
•  Soak poles in water for at least 5 to 7 days before 
planting.

emerge above adjacent vegetation such that it 
will not be shaded out. 
•  Place the cuttings in the holes the same day they 
were removed from the soak treatment.  Set the 
butt as close to the lowest annual water table 
elevation as possible. 
•  Electric hammer drills (Dewalt model DW530) 
fitted with one-inch diameter, 3-foot bits were 
used to plant thousands of willows in New 
Mexico.  With one drill, two people installed 500 
willow cuttings per day to a 3-foot depth.  A 
power auger or a punch bar can also be used. 
•  Willow pole cuttings were generally planted on 
10 to 20 foot centers in New Mexico.  Areas 
with a shallow water table (4-6 feet) were 
generally planted with a higher number of pole 
cuttings to enhance overall survival.  Often 
understory species were planted under the 
canopy of pre-existing overstory (cottonwoods, 
tree willows), since they are often observed 
occupying this niche. 
It is critical to ensure that the soil is packed 
around the cutting to prevent air pockets.  
&quot.Mudding&quot. (filling the hole with water and then 
adding soil to make mud slurry) can remove air 
pockets. 
• 
•  When necessary, install tree guards around the 
poles to protect from beavers, other rodents, or 
rabbits.  Willows tend to be fairly resistant to 
pruning from beavers, so tree guards may not be 
necessary. 
•  As buds begin to swell (usually in April or May), 
remove them from the lower two-thirds of the 
pole.  This will reduce evapotranspiration water 
loss and stimulate root growth. 
•  Exclude the planting area from livestock grazing 
for at least two to three growing seasons. 
 
Seed Collections 
•  Willow seeds must be collected as soon as the 
capsules mature (when they turn from green to 
yellow or tan). 
•  Plant seeds immediately, since they retain their 
viability for only a few days at room 
temperature.  Even under the most favorable 
conditions, maximum storage is four to six 
weeks.  
•  Germination takes place 12 to 14 hours after 
planting.  Keep soil moist while seedlings 
germinate and grow.  
•  When seeding outdoors, willows require moist 
soil from spring over-bank flows, capillary 
wetting of the soil surface, or irrigation for 
establishment.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='Traditional resource management of willow includes 
the following: 
•  Willows were traditionally tended by pruning or 
burning to produce long straight stems.  
•  Willow is gathered only at certain times of the 
year, beginning in the autumn after the leaves 
fall.  For many weavers, gathering will continue 
until the following spring when the sap begins to 
rise again.  
•  Often, basketweavers will prune many willows, 
sometimes replanting the stems, so there will be 
nice straight basketry materials the following 
year. 
•  Before gathering, the weavers make offerings of 
thanks and pray for permission to gather.  Often 
tobacco or other offerings are given before 
beginning to gather. 
•  Basket weavers process materials with their 
hands and mouths.  Herbicides sprayed on 
willows and along streams have a much higher 
health risk for humans when they are processed 
and used for traditional materials.  
 
Howe and Knopf (1991) conclude that to ensure the 
survival of willows and cottonwoods in riparian 
communities, resource managers need to implement 
strategies to control the spread of exotic species. 
 
Livestock grazing has widely been identified as a 
leading factor causing or contributing to degradation 
of riparian habitats in the western United States 
(Chaney et al. 1990, Fleischner 1994, Ohmart 1996).  
Livestock grazing can alter vegetative structure and 
composition of riparian habitat.  Overgrazing, 
especially by livestock and big game, frequently 
changes plant species composition and growth form, 
density of stands, vigor, seed production of plants, 
and insect production.  Livestock grazing can cause 
the replacement of bird and mammal species 
requiring the vertical vegetation structure of riparian 
habitat to species, which are ubiquitous in their 
habitat preferences. Previous heavy cattle grazing 
changed the bird and small mammal community 
composition in riparian areas through reduction of 
shrub and herbaceous cover. 
 
Slovlin (1984) recommended a 5-year rest from cattle 
grazing to re-establish healthy stands of riparian 
vegetation such as cottonwood and willows.  Siekert 
et al. (1985) reported that spring grazing showed no 
significant changes in channel morphology, whereas 
summer and fall grazing did.  However, even with 
limited seasonal grazing, all tree seedlings would be 
eliminated.  Marlow and Pogacnik (1985) 
recommended fencing riparian habitat, rest-rotation,

light grazing (&lt.20% forage removal), and grazing 
after streambanks have dried to 10% moisture.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Uses TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Uses='Ethnobotanic: Sagittaria is an aquatic plant with 
tuberous roots that can be eaten like potatoes.  Lewis 
and Clark found it at the mouth of the Willamette and 
considered it equal to the potato, and valuable for 
trade.  Indian women collected it in shallow water 
from a canoe, or waded into ponds or marshes in the 
late summer and loosened the roots with their toes. 
The roots would rise to the top of the water where 
they were gathered and tossed into floating baskets.  
Today, the tubers are harvested with a hoe, pitchfork, 
or rake.  Tubers are baked in fire embers, boiled, or 
roasted in the ashes.  Tubers are skinned and eaten 
whole or mashed.  
After roasting, some tubers were dried and stored for 
winter use.  The Chippewa gathered the &quot.Indian 
potatoes&quot. in the fall, strung them, and hung them 
overhead in the wigwam to dry.  Later they were 
boiled for use. 
The tubers of Sagittaria species were eaten by many 
different indigenous groups in Canada, as well as 
many groups of Washington and Oregon (Kuhnlein 
and Turner 1991). The tubers were also widely traded 
from harvesting centers to neighboring areas.  The 
tubers were also a major item of commerce on the 
Lower Columbia in Chinook Territory.  Katzie 
families owned large patches of the plant and 
clearing the patches claimed ownership.  Family 
groups would camp beside their claimed harvesting 
sites for a month or more. 
A species of Sagittaria grows in China, and is sold in 
the markets of China and Japan as food, the corms 
being full of starch.  Sagittaria latifolia is extensively 
cultivated in the San Francisco Bay area in California 
to supply the Chinese markets, and the tubers are 
commonly to be found on sale.  The Chinese, on 
coming to California, used it for food and may have 
cultivated it somewhat.  In so doing, they are 
believed to have extended its range into the southern 
part of the state (Mason 1957). 
Medicinally, the Maidu of California used an 
infusion of arrowhead roots to clean and treat 
wounds.  The Navajo use these plants for headaches. 
The Ojibwa and the Chippewa used Sagittaria 
species as a remedy for indigestion.  The Cherokee 
used an infusion of leaves to bathe feverish babies, 
with one sip given orally.  The Iroquois used it for 
rheumatism, a dermatological aid, and a laxative.  
The Iroquois used it as a ceremonial blessing when 
they began planting corn. 
Wildlife: Tubers are planted as an wildlife food.  
Ducks eat the small, flat seeds of arrowheads, but the 
tubers are the most valuable to wildlife.  Muskrat and 
porcupine are known to eat the tubers.  Swans, geese, 
wood ducks, blue-winged teal, lesser and greater 
scaup, ruddy duck, ring necked duck, pintail, mallard, 
mottled duck, gadwall, canvasback, black duck and 
king rail are known to eat arrowhead seeds and 
tubers.  For wildlife use, the tubers of Sagittaria 
latifolia are often too large and too deeply buried to 
be useful to ducks (Martin 1951).

Muskrats have evolved with wetland ecosystems and 
form a valuable component of healthy functioning 
wetland communities.  Muskrats use emergent 
wetland vegetation such as Sagittaria  species for 
food.  Muskrat grazed areas increase wetland 
diversity by opening up the dense stands of Typha 
and Schoenoplectus (Scirpus) species, and providing 
opportunities for aquatic vegetation such as 
Sagittaria to become established in the open water. 
Muskrat huts provide a substrate for shrubs and other 
plant species.  Indian people often sought caches of 
Sagittaria tubers stored by muskrat and beaver.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Description='General: Arrowhead Family (Alismataceae).  Both 
Sagittaria latifolia and Sagittaria cuneata are aquatic 
plants growing in swampy ground or standing water 
in ponds, lakes, stream edges, and ditches (Hickman 
1993). Both species have white or bluish tubers, 
which are edible.  The leaves are sagittate, with leaf 
blades are either erect or floating on the surface of 
the water.  S. cuneata leaf blades are smaller, from 5­
15 cm, and the lower lobes of emergent leaf blades 
are less than the terminal lobe.  In S. latifolia, leaf 
blades are from 6-30 cm, and the lower lobes of the 
emergent leaf blade are approximately equal to the 
terminal lobe.  The inflorescence is simple or 
branching, often with the lower flowers pistillate and 
the upper ones staminate.  The flowers are white, 
with three white petals and 3 sepals.  Stamens are 
numerous and bright yellow.  The pistils are 
numerous, spirally arranged on the receptacle.  The 
fruit is an achene and is greenish colored.  A 
diagnostic feature distinguishing the two species is 
the beak on the fruit of S. cuneata is ascending to 
erect and &lt.0.5 mm. the beak on the fruit of S. latifolia 
is spreading and 1-2 mm.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Distribution TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Distribution='For current distribution, please consult the Plant 
Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
site.  Sagittaria species are obligate wetland plants 
found in marshes and wetlands throughout temperate 
North America.  The ranges of S. cuneata and S. 
latifolia overlap.  S. latifolia is found from central 
and southern British Columbia to Nova Scotia and 
Prince Edward Island, south to California and into 
South America.  In California, S. latifolia is confined 
to lower elevations &lt.1500 m.  Sagittaria species 
grow in ponds, slow streams, ditches and freshwater 
wetlands.  
' WHERE symbol='sala2';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Sagittaria species may be planted from bare root 
stock, by transplanting the tubers, and by seeding 
directly into wetland soil.  Live plant transplants or 
transplanting tubers are preferred revegetation 
methods where there is moving water.  It takes two 
years for seed to germinate. planting bare root stock 
or tubers gives faster revegetation results. 
Live Plant Collections: No more than 1/4 of the 
plants in an area should be collected.  If no more than 
0.09 m² (1 ft²) are removed from a 0.4 m2 (4 ft2) 
area, the plants will grow back into the hole in one 
good growing season.  A depth of 15 cm (6 in) is 
sufficiently deep for digging plugs.  This will leave 
enough plants and rhizomes to grow back during the 
growing season.  
Wild plants should be collected after the leaves begin 
to emerge in the spring until the first frost.  The 
plants can be pulled up easily from wet soil.  When 
collecting wild plants, rinse roots gently.  Leaves and 
stems can be clipped from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 
inches). this allows the plant to allocate more energy 
into root production.  The roots should always remain 
moist or in water until planted.  Plants should be 
transported and stored in a cool location prior to 
planting.  Water depth should be 0 to 6&quot. and the soils 
should be wet. 
Sagittaria grows prolifically around ponds or 
wetlands in shallow water.  Plug spacing of 25-30 cm 
will fill in within one growing season.  Soil should be 
kept saturated, with approximately 1/2&quot. of water over 
the surface of the soil after planting.  If water is low 
in nutrients (oligotrophic), fertilization will speed 
biomass production and revegetation. Many surface 
waters are already rich in nutrients (eutrophic), and 
fertilization is not necessary. 
Indian potatoes transplant success may be greater 
with the tubers than with bare root stock.  The little 
underground potatoes can be separated from the 
parent plants with a rake, hoe, or shovel. In 
unconsolidated soils, the tubers can be pulled up by 
hand by searching around the roots of the plant. 
After collecting, the Sagittaria potatoes should be 
kept moist and cool, and stored in peat moss. 
Potatoes are then planted in shallow water, in the 
same conditions as described above for the whole 
plants.  Potatoes should be collected and planted

listed under the subheading “Department of 
Agriculture.” 
Seed Germination: Seeds of Sagittaria species take 
two years to germinate, because they have a double 
dormancy requiring cold then warm then cold 
temperatures.  Temperature has a multiple role in the 
regulation of timing of germination.  Dormant seeds 
become non-dormant only at specific temperatures, 
non-dormant seeds have specific temperature 
requirements for germination, and non-dormant seeds 
of some species are induced into dormancy by certain 
temperatures.  Once Sagittaria seeds germinate, they 
have fairly high viability. Procedures for growing 
Sagittaria seeds in the greenhouse have not been 
developed at this time. 
Sagittaria seeds can be planted directly in wetlands 
or ponds.  Prepare the area by creating a washboard 
in shallow water, at mudflat consistency.  Seeds 
should then be scattered on the surface of the soil, as 
the seeds need sunlight to germinate well.  Light and 
temperature in natural conditions will promote seed 
germination, and in two years Sagittaria plants will 
emerge.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='Hydrology is the most important factor in 
determining wetland type, revegetation success, and 
wetland function and value.  Changes in water levels 
influence species composition, structure, and 
distribution of plant communities.  Water 
management is absolutely critical during plant 
establishment, and remains crucial through the life of 
the wetland for proper community management.  
Sagittaria species require moist soils to standing 
water for successful revegetation. 
We have no record of specific traditional resource 
management techniques other than anecdotal 
information of the use of fire to keep dense tule 
marshes open, which provided an opportunity for 
colonization and spread of Sagittaria species.  The 
harvest of arrowhead was usually made in late 
summer as the stems and leaves were dying (and 
usually when the water table was lower) (Balls 1962).

baskets, drums, stirrups, tipi pegs and pins, fox and 
fish traps, hunting lodge poles, and meat-drying racks 
(Kindscher 1992).  Willows were and still are used 
for baskets throughout their range.  The Paiute, Ute, 
Shoshone, Hopi, Havasupai, Mandan, Cheyenne, 
Arapaho, Kiowa, and others use Salix lucida for 
basketweaving (James 1972, Mason 1988). 
 
Kelly Kindscher(1992) wrote in Medicinal Wild 
Plants of the Prairie: &quot.The Blackfeet made a tea from 
the fresh root of Salix species to treat internal 
hemorrhage, throat constrictions, swollen neck 
glands, and bloodshot or irritated eyes.  The twigs 
were also gathered and preserved.  Steeped in boiling 
water, they were made into a tea to cure fever or 
alleviate pain.&quot. 
 
Salix species were used as chew sticks to clean teeth 
by many other Indian tribes, including the Choctaw, 
Delaware, and Cheyenne.  The shining willow was 
favored by the Osage, Delaware, and Cherokee for 
this purpose (Elvin-Lewis 1979).  The Kiowa made a 
tea of willow leaves, which they rubbed on the body 
to cure pneumonia and relieve rheumatic aches.  
They also chewed the bark to relieve toothache 
                          Plant Guide  
 
(Vestal and Shultes 1939).  The Comanche burned 
the stems of the willow and used the ashes to treat 
sore eyes (Carlson and Jones 1939).  To restore 
themselves both physically and mentally, the Dakota  
drank a willow-bark tea (Andros 1883).  The Ojibwe 
used shining willow bark externally to treat skin 
rashes. 
 
Aspirin is the pharmaceutical equivalent of willow 
bark tea, which is an effective remedy for headache, 
fever or sore throat.  More than 2,400 years ago, the 
Greeks learned to use extracts of several native 
willow species to treat pain, gout, and other illnesses.  
In more recent times, 1839, salicylic acid was 
isolated from wild plants and manufactured 
synthetically.  Early salicylic acid-based products had 
unpleasant side effects.  Sixty years later, the Bayer 
Company developed a derivative of salicylic acid, 
called it aspirin, and the rest is history. 
 
Tea made from willow leaves will cure laryngitis.  
Willow reduces inflammation of joints and 
membranes (Moore 1979).  When used as an 
analgesic, willow treats urethra and bladder irritation, 
infected wounds, and eczema.  Willow is used as an 
over-all treatment of many diseases, including hay 
fever, diarrhea, prostatitis, satyriasis, and ovarian 
pain.  A poultice is made for treating gangrene and 
skin ulcers.  
 
Young willow shoots can be stripped of their bark 
and eaten.  The young leaves may be eaten in case of 
emergency.  The inner bark can be eaten raw, 
prepared like spaghetti, or made into flour. 
 
Riparian: Riparian ecosystem functions provided by 
willows include the following: 1) Riparian vegetation 
traps sediments and nutrients from surface runoff and 
prevents them from entering the aquatic system. 2) 
the dense matrix of roots in the riparian zone can 
serve as an effective filter of shallow groundwater. 3) 
water quality is improved through filtration and the 
trapping of sediment, nutrients (particularly nitrogen 
dissolved in groundwater), and pollutants. and 4) 
riparian areas act as a sponge by absorbing 
floodwaters.  The water is then slowly released over a 
period of time, which minimizes flood damage and 
sustains higher base flows during late summer. 
 
Wildlife: Structurally complex riparian vegetation 
communities provide many different habitats and 
support a diverse array of animal species.  The layers

of vegetation provide multiple niches for many 
species of insects and wildlife.  Canopies of plants 
growing on streambank provide shade, cooling 
stream water, while roots stabilize and create 
overhanging banks, providing habitat for fish and 
other aquatic organisms. 
 
Rabbits and many ungulates (including deer, moose, 
and elk) browse on willow twigs, foliage, and bark 
(Martin 1951).  Beaver love willow branches.  
Several species of birds eat willow buds and young 
twigs.  Riparian forests support a high diversity of 
breeding birds (Miller 1951).  The percentage of 
breeding individuals, which are migratory, is very 
high in the cottonwood-willow habitat.  Moister 
conditions in the cottonwood-willow forest may 
promote lush plant growth, higher invertebrate 
populations and, therefore, more available food for 
flycatchers, warblers, and other migratory, 
insectivorous birds.  Riparian areas support up to 
10.6 times the density of migrant birds per hectare as 
adjacent non-riparian areas (Stevens et al. 1977).  
Most of these migratory birds belong to the foliage 
insect (47%) or air insect (34%) foraging guilds.

The NRCS, Plant Materials Center, Los Lunas, New 
Mexico, in cooperation with the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service, developed a pole planting technique 
for establishing willow (Hoag 1993a).  We reprint 
this procedure below.  &quot.Trial planting on well adapted 
sites indicate more that 80% survival of cottonwood 
and willow poles when dormant poles are cut and 
planted between November and February.  It is 
essential to monitor the water tables at proposed 
planting sites for at least one year before planting.  
Poles planted where the water table fluctuates widely 
will have lower survival rates than those planted 
where water table is relatively stable.  If groundwater 
monitoring shows the water level will drop more than 
3 feet during the growing season (May-October), 
another site should be selected.  Monitoring of 
observation wells for at least one calendar year 
before planting will allow better planting depth to 
ensure establishment.&quot.  
 
Steps for Successful Pole Plantings 
•  Select collection sites as close to the area as 
possible to conserve genetic diversity.  Try to 
match donor site and revegetation site in terms of 
soils, elevation, hydro-dynamics, permanent 
groundwater table, and soil salinity (which 
should be low).  
•  Select willow cuttings from a local, native stand 
in healthy condition.  Prune no more than 2/3 of 
plants in an area.  Willow cuttings for pole 
plantings should generally be at least 1/2 inch in 
diameter or larger.  Select the longest, straightest 
poles available.  Use only two to four-year old 
wood.  The total length of the poles needed 
depends upon the water table depth. 
•  Measure water table fluctuations in the planting 
area for at least 1 year, preferably longer, to 
determine the lowest water table depth.  Take a 
reading at least once a month, preferably more 
often during the driest months of the year.  
•  Cut poles while dormant.  Remove all side 
branches except the top two or three. 
•  Prepare cuttings by trimming off the top to 
remove the terminal bud, allowing a majority of 
the energy in the stem to be sent to the lateral 
buds for root and shot development. 
•  Soak poles in water for at least 5 to 7 days before 
planting.  

Page 3
•  Dig holes to the depth of the lowest anticipated 
water table.  Sites where the water table will be 
within one foot of the ground surface during the 
growing season are better suited for willows than 
cottonwoods. 
•  The cuttings should extend several inches into 
the permanent water table to ensure adequate 
moisture for sprouting.  At least 1/2 to 2/3 s of 
the cutting should be below ground to prevent 
the cutting from being ripped out during high 
flows.  Usually, at least 2 to 3 feet should be 
below ground.  It should also be long enough to 
emerge above adjacent vegetation such that it 
will not be shaded out. 
•  Place the cuttings in the holes the same day they 
were removed from the soak treatment.  Set the 
butt as close to the lowest annual water table 
elevation as possible. 
•  Electric hammer drills (Dewalt model DW530) 
fitted with one-inch diameter, 3-foot bits were 
used to plant thousands of willows in New 
Mexico.  With one drill, two people installed 500 
willow cuttings per day to a 3-foot depth.  A 
power auger or a punch bar can also be used. 
•  Willow pole cuttings were generally planted on 
•  When necessary, install tree guards around the 
poles to protect from beavers, other rodents, or 
rabbits.  Willows tend to be fairly resistant to 
pruning from beavers, so tree guards may not be 
necessary. 
•  As buds begin to swell (usually in April or May), 
remove them from the lower two-thirds of the 
pole.  This will reduce evapotranspiration water 
loss and stimulate root growth. 
•  Exclude the planting area from livestock grazing 
for at least two to three growing seasons. 
 
Seed Collections 
•  Willow seeds must be collected as soon as the 
capsules mature (when they turn from green to 
yellow or tan). 
10 to 20 foot centers in New Mexico.  Areas 
with a shallow water table (4-6 feet) were 
generally planted with a higher number of pole 
cuttings to enhance overall survival.  Often 
understory species were planted under the 
canopy of pre-existing overstory (cottonwoods, 
tree willows), since they are often observed 
occupying this niche. 
It is critical to ensure that the soil is packed 
around the cutting to prevent air pockets.  
&quot.Mudding&quot. (filling the hole with water and then 
adding soil to make mud slurry) can remove air 
pockets. 
• 
•  Plant seeds immediately, since they retain their 
viability for only a few days at room 
temperature.  Even under the most favorable 
conditions, maximum storage is four to six 
weeks.  
•  Germination takes place 12 to 14 hours after 
planting.  Keep soil moist while seedlings 
germinate and grow.  
•  When seeding outdoors, willows require moist 
soil from spring over-bank flows, capillary 
wetting of the soil surface, or irrigation for 
establishment.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='Traditional resource management of willow includes 
the following: 
•  Willows were traditionally tended by pruning or 
burning to produce long straight stems.  
•  Willow is gathered only at certain times of the 
year, beginning in the autumn after the leaves 
fall.  For many weavers, gathering will continue 
until the following spring when the sap begins to 
rise again.  
•  Often, basketweavers will prune many willows, 
sometimes replanting the stems, so there will be 
nice straight basketry materials the following 
year. 
•  Before gathering, the weavers make offerings of 
thanks and pray for permission to gather.  Often 
tobacco or other offerings are given before 
beginning to gather. 
•  Basket weavers process materials with their 
hands and mouths.  Herbicides sprayed on 
willows and along streams have a much higher 
health risk for humans, when willows are 
processed and used for traditional materials.  
 
Howe and Knopf (1991) conclude that to ensure the 
survival of willows and cottonwoods in riparian 
communities, resource managers need to implement 
strategies to control the spread of exotic species. 
 
Livestock grazing has widely been identified as a 
leading factor causing or contributing to degradation 
of riparian habitats in the western United States 
(Chaney et al. 1990, Fleischner 1994, Ohmart 1996).  
Livestock grazing can alter vegetative structure and 
composition of riparian habitat.  Overgrazing, 
especially by livestock and big game, frequently 
changes plant species composition and growth form, 
density of stands, vigor, seed production of plants, 
and insect production.  Livestock grazing can cause 
the replacement of bird and mammal species 
requiring the vertical vegetation structure of riparian 
habitat to species, which are ubiquitous in their 
 
 

Page 4
habitat preferences.  Previous heavy cattle grazing 
changed the bird and small mammal community 
composition in riparian areas through reduction of 
shrub and herbaceous cover. 
 
Slovlin (1984) recommended a 5-year rest from cattle 
grazing to re-establish healthy stands of riparian 
vegetation such as cottonwood and willows.  Siekert 
et al. (1985) reported that spring grazing showed no 
significant changes in channel morphology, whereas 
summer and fall grazing did.  However, even with 
limited seasonal grazing, all tree seedlings would be 
eliminated.  Marlow and Pogacnik (1985) 
recommended fencing riparian habitat, rest-rotation, 
light grazing (&lt.20% forage removal), and grazing 
after streambanks have dried to 10% moisture.

The Houma used juice crushed from the small roots 
as an eye medicine to relieve irritation.  Dried roots 
were taken for high blood pressure.  A tea from the 
dried roots was taken for kidney ailments and as a 
stimulant for “swimming in the head.”  The fresh 
roots were baked and served as “palmetto bread.”  
The small fruits, sometimes called “famine food” 
were also eaten.  The Seminoles, Houma, Choctaw,

dwarf palmetto much in the same way that they used 
the leaves of the related tree, cabbage palmetto 
(Sabal palmetto).  The fan-shaped leaves were used 
to thatch homes.  Immature blades from the leaves 
were prepared by sun-bleaching and then braided into 
thin strips for use as lashings or sewn together to 
make baskets and other useful articles.  Leaves were 
used to make fans that were carried during certain

Wildlife:  The fruits are an important food for robins 
and raccoons, providing from 10% to 20% of their 
diet.  Fish crows, mockingbirds, myrtle warblers, 
pileated and red-bellied woodpeckers, and gray 
squirrels also eat the fruits. 
 
Livestock: This plant is reported to be frequently 
grazed by cattle, more so than any other palm.

height of only 0.5 to 2 m.  The stem is usually not 
visible, being either buried or very short, although it 
has been reported to occasionally reach 8m tall in 
Louisiana and Texas.  The circular, fan-like leaves 
are composed of 16 to 40 pale- or blue-green blades 
that are 15dm wide.  These stiff, nearly flat blades do 
not have a prominent midrib.  The white flower 
petals are 2 to 3 mm long.  The small fruits (6-8mm 
in diameter) are glossy black in color and enclose a 
large seed (5-6mm).  The fruits ripen in the fall.

COMMON 
ELDERBERRY 
Sambucus nigra L. ssp. 
canadensis (L.) R. Bolli 
Plant Symbol = SANIC4 
 
Contributed by: USDA NRCS National Plant Data 
Center &amp. the Biota of North America Program 
 
Elderberries are quite edible.  The blue or purple 
berries are gathered and made into elderberry wine, 
jam, syrup, and pies.  The entire flower cluster can be 
dipped in batter and fried while petals can be eaten 
raw or made into a fragrant and tasty tea. The flowers 
add an aromatic flavor and lightness to pancakes or 
fritters. 
 
The elderberry is of well-known value to the Indians 
of North America and the many purposes it serves 
(Barrow 1967).  Elderberry is highly prized by both 
Spaniards and Cahuillas.  Throughout the months of 
July and August the small clusters of berries are 
gathered in large quantities.  These clusters are dried 
carefully on the drying floor and preserved in 
considerable amounts.  When wanted, they are 
cooked into a rich sauce that needs no sweetening.  A 
Cahuilla family during this season of the year will 
subsist largely on these messes of &quot.sauco.&quot.  
Frequently, the elderberry was so greatly enjoyed that 
families would live for weeks on little else.  Many 
were dried for use in the winter, and were either re-
cooked or eaten raw.  Elderberries are still highly 
prized for food by modern Indian people.  
 
Elderberry twigs and fruit are employed in creating 
dyes for basketry.  These stems are dyed a very deep 
black by soaking them for a week or so in a wash 
made from the berry stems of the elderberry 
(Barrows 1967).  The Cahuilla split basketry 
materials from the aromatic sumac (Rhus trilobata).  
 
Elderberry branches were used to make the shaft of 
arrows.  Flutes and whistles were constructed by 
boring holes into stems hollowed out with hot sticks. 
Clapper sticks were made by splitting the stem and 
clapping the two halves against each other. Clapper 
sticks were used ceremonially in the round-house to 
accompany singing and dancing. The pith of the 
stems was used as tinder, and the stem itself was 
employed as a twirling stick for starting the fire. 
Hollowed-out elderberry stems can be made into 
squirt guns.  
 
In the middle ages elderberry was considered a Holy 
Tree, capable of restoring good health, keeping good 
health, and as an aid to longevity. 
 
Fruits of elderberry are gathered from the wild for 
wine, jellies, candy, pies, and sauces. The plants are 
commercially cultivated for fruit production in

Oregon.  Sambucus canadensis and S. nigra have 
long been used in the same way, and cultivars of both 
have been developed.  All parts of the elderberry 
plant are considered to be a valuable healing plant in 
many folk medicine traditions (Hutchens 1991, 
Walker et al. 1993. Barrett et al. 1933. Clarke 1977). 
Elderberry flowers contain flavenoids and rutin, 
which are known to improve immune function, 
particularly in combination with vitamin “C.”   The 
flowers also contain tannins, which account for its 
traditional use to reduce bleeding, diarrhea, and 
congestion. 
 
The flowers are the mildest part of the plant and 
prepared as a tea, are used to break dry fevers and 
stimulate perspiration, aid headache, indigestion, 
twitching eyes, dropsy, rheumatism, appendix 
inflammation, bladder or kidney infections, colds, 
influenza, consumption (bleeding in lungs), and is 
helpful to newborn babies (Hutchens 1991).  Used as 
a wash, the flowers or leaves are good for wounds, 
sprains, and bruises, as well as for sores on domestic 
animals.  The leaves, which are stronger, have a 
slightly laxative property.  Applied externally, leaves, 
flowers, bark and twigs are excellent as a poultice, 
mixed equally with chamomile, for soreness, 
inflammations, joint stiffness, and to reduce the 
swelling of bee stings.  The flowers and berries, 
employed as a diuretic, can aid arthritis and 
rheumatism.  Steeped in water, the flowers are used 
externally to aid in complexion beauty, tone and 
soften the skin, and lighten freckles or spots.  The 
berry juice made into salve aids burns and scalds.  
The juice taken internally will act as a purgative. 
 
Livestock: Elderberry is a useful range plant for 
domestic livestock, but is not equally palatable 
during all seasons.  It is usually receives limited 
browsing in the spring and to a much greater extent 
in the late summer and fall.  The leaves are eagerly 
devoured after the first heavy frost in the fall.  
Because many branches are beyond the reach of the 
animals, utilization is less destructive.  Browse 
rating: Good for goats. good to fair for sheep. good to 
poor for deer. fair for cattle. and fair to poor for 
horses (Sampson and Jesperson 1981). 
 
Wildlife: Structurally complex riparian vegetation 
communities provide many different habitats and 
support a diverse array of animal species.  Different 
groups of animals occupy or use the different layers 
of vegetation, and this multi-story arrangement is 
often present nowhere else in the arid landscapes.  
Canopies of plants growing on stream banks provide 
shade, cooling stream water, while roots stabilize and 
 
 
create overhanging banks, providing habitat for fish 
and other aquatic organisms. 
 
Game birds, squirrels and other rodents, and several 
kinds of browsers also feed on the fruit or foliage of 
elderberry.  Bears love to eat the elderberry fruits 
while deer, elk, and moose browse on the stems and 
foliage.  The elderberries are important sources of 
summer food for many kinds of songbirds.  For 
example, the western bluebird, indigo bunting, 
common house finch, red-shafted flicker, ash-
throated flycatcher, black-headed grosbeak, scrub 
jay, Stellar jay, ruby-crowned kinglet, mockingbird, 
red-breasted nuthatch, Bullock’s oriole, hooded 
oriole, song sparrow, white-crowned sparrow, 
western tanager, California thrasher, russet-backed 
thrush, brown towhee, Audubon warbler, cedar 
waxwing, Lewis and Nuttall s woodpecker, wren-tit, 
grouse, pheasant, and pigeons all eat elderberries 
(Martin et al. 1951).  
 
The valley elderberry longhorn beetle (VELB) 
(Desmocerus californicus dimorphus) was listed as 
threatened under The Endangered Species Act on 
August 8, 1980.  The elderberry beetle is endemic to 
moist valley oak riparian woodlands along the 
margins of rivers and streams in the lower 
Sacramento and upper San Joaquin Valley of 
California where elderberry grows.  The primary 
threat to the VELB is loss of habitat, insecticide and 
herbicide use, and lack of elderberry shrubs/trees as a 
food plant for the beetle. The mitigation for VELB 
habitat loss, considered a taking under The 
Endangered Species Act, is quite stringent (U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service Mitigation Guidelines). 
 
In general, longhorn beetles are characterized by 
somewhat elongate and cylindrical bodies with long 
antennae, often in excess of 2/3 of the body length.  
Male VELB have a metallic-green pattern of 4 
oblong maculations, surrounded by a bright red-
orange border. The body length is about 13-21 mm, 
and antennae are about a long as the body.  Females 
are more robust, with body length about 18-25 mm, 
and the dark pattern is not reduced. 
 
Elderberry is planted because of its forage and cover 
value, productivity, adaptability, and ease of 
establishment.  It is a useful ground cover for 
stabilizing streambanks and eroding sites.  It provides 
food, cover, perching, and nesting sites for many 
species of birds and food and cover for various other 
wildlife, and it is important as browse for mule deer 
and elk.  In the spring the leaves may be strongly 
scented and less palatable, but they sweeten and 
become more palatable by fall.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Adaptation='Elderberry grows on moist, well-drained sunny sites, 
usually occurring in early seral communities or in 
openings in moist forest habitats (slopes, canyons, 
cliff bases, streamsides, streambanks) and moist areas 
within drier, more open habitats (sagebrush, 
mountain brush, pinyon-juniper, ponderosa pine, 
often along fence rows and roads). at elevations of 3-
3000 meters.  Elderberry is a dominant understory 
species in riparian woodlands.  It can persist past 
seral stages as scattered individuals in open forests, 
woodlands, chaparral, or riparian zones.  This species 
flowers from May to September and fruits from July 
to October.  Common elderberry is more common on 
warmer sites than red elderberry (Sambucus 
racemosa), although they overlap in habitat 
preference.   
 
In California, common riparian woodland associates 
are valley oak (Quercus lobata), interior live oak 
(Quercus wislizenii), California walnut (Juglans 
hindsii), and California sycamore (Platanus 
racemosa).  Box elder (Acer negundo), Oregon ash 
(Fraxinus latifolia), alder (Alnus rhombifolia), and 
willow (Salix gooddingii, Salix exigua, Salix 
lasiandra, and Salix laevigata) are particularly 
prevalent in the subcanopy.  Understory species are 
mostly shrubs, including elderberry (Sambucus 
mexicana), buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis), 
blackberry (Rubus spp.), and California rose (Rosa 
californica).  Lianas, such as poison oak 
(Toxicodendron diversiloba) and California grape 
(Vitis californica) are a dominant feature.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Elderberry produces a good seed crop almost every 
year.  The seeds are dispersed by birds and other 
animals that eat the fruit.  The seeds have a hard seed 
coat and embryo dormancy and may remain viable 
for up to 16 years in storage.  Without pretreatment, 
seed germination may be delayed from 2 to 5 years 
after planting.  Plants may flower and fruit after only 
2-3 years and can reach full size in 3-4 years.  They 
are said to be “short-lived.”  Vegetative reproduction 
is limited to coppicing if the stems are killed or 
injured.   
 
Seeds: 
Elderberry grows best from seed.  
Elderberry fruits are collected when ripe and spread 
in thin layers to dry. 
To separate seeds from fruits either 1) run fruit 
through a macerator with water and the pulp and 
empty seeds float. 2) crush, dry and use without 

Page 4
separating fruits and seeds. and 3) for small 
amounts of fruit they can be cleaned in a fruit 
blender. 
•  Elderberry seed can be stored dry at 41 °F for 
several years. 
•  Elderberry seeds can be sown in the fall soon 
after collection, or stratified and sown in the 
spring.  In either case, germination is often not 
complete until the second spring.  
• 
•  A seedling density of 35 plant per square foot is 
sought.  Seeds are sown 1/4 inch deep in drills 
and covered with about 3/8 inch of sawdust 
mulch. 
In the greenhouse, seeds are warm stratified for 
two months in a mixture of peat, vermiculite, and 
sand at 21° to 30°C. (70 to 85°F).  Seeds are then 
placed close to the soil surface in flats in the 
greenhouse.  There are usually several hundred 
seeds in one seed flat. 
Seedlings are then potted from the flats in deep 
3&quot. pots.  
•  After one season of growth, the seedlings are 
• 
field planted in the fall or spring when they are 6 
to 8 months old.  If planted in the fall irrigation 
may not be necessary in moist sites.  In drier 
sites or with spring planting, irrigation will be 
required for seedling establishment. 
Cuttings: 
•  Cuttings of elderberry tend to have lower 
survival success than establishment from seed. 
•  Use hardwood cuttings from previous seasons 
growth.  
•  Take &quot.heel cuttings&quot. from older wood, so inner 
pith is not exposed. 
•  Cuttings should be at least 10&quot., and have at least 
two nodes.  Cuttings are placed in 4&quot. pots with 
perlite and peat.  Plants are kept moist.  
•  Cuttings have a fragile root system, with high 
mortality occurring when transplanted. Care 
should be taken to be very gentle with delicate 
roots when transplanting. 
•  The cuttings, which do survive, seem to establish 
and grow faster.  Plant biomass production, 
height, flowering and seed set is more rapid than 
with seedlings. 
Transplanting Trees and Stems: 
•  All elderberry plants with evidence of valley 
elderberry longhorn beetle use (i.e. emergence 
holes or presence of adults) should be 
transplanted, as they provide habitat for a 
threatened species under The Endangered 
Species Act.  For further technical information, 
call a representative of the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service. 
 
 
 
 
•  Cut tree back to 3 to 6 feet from the ground or to 
50 percent of its height (whichever is greater) by 
removing branches and stems above this height.  
The trunk and all stems greater than 1.5 inches in 
diameter can be replanted. 
If the presence of tunnels excavated by the beetle 
larvae inside the elderberry stem and trunk are 
detected, place pruned material next to 
transplanted elderberries. 
•  Move plant by the root ball. Keep the root ball 
• 
wet. 
•  Place transplant in holes 3 to 4 feet deep. 
•  Construct circular water retention basin from the 
excavated earth about 8-10 feet in diameter and 
12 to 14 inches high. Plant the main trunk of an 
elderberry in the center of each water basin. 
Plant other stems that have been rooted around 
the circumference of the basin.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='In six riparian restoration projects carried out in 
California, competition from exotic weed species was 
a key factor in mortality and site failure (Baird 1989).  
On small sites, hand weeding around trees and shrubs 
is the most effective means of weed control.  One 
way to avoid competition from weeds on larger sites 
is to remove the surface soil, although this has the 
disadvantage of removing nutrients, mycorrhizal 
fungi, bacteria, and insect and invertebrate 
populations critical to a healthy habitat.  A cover crop 
of native wildflowers was also used to control weeds, 
with wildflower seeds hand-broadcast over the site.  
On wetter, heavier soils this does not seem to provide 
effective weed control. 
 
There is considerable evidence that fertilization can 
favor exotic weeds over native plants. Inoculation 
with mycorrhizal fungi enables seedlings of some 
species to better utilize limited supplies of both water 
and nutrients.  Inoculation of transplanted shrubs may 
be accomplished through inclusion of large (1.2 m 
deep by 2.8 m wide) root balls with plants.  Smaller, 
more economical soil plugs scattered throughout the 
site serve the same purpose.  The number of soil 
plugs needed to ensure the establishment of soil flora 
is directly related to the distance of the restoration 
site from a similar, mature community. 
 
Given that elderberry provides habitat for the 
federally listed valley longhorn elderberry beetle, 
livestock grazing of elderberry is not recommended.   
Livestock grazing can alter vegetative structure and 
composition of riparian habitat.  Overgrazing by 

Page 5
livestock and big game frequently changes plant 
species composition and growth form, density of 
stands, vigor, seed production of plants, and insect 
production.  
 
Clear-cutting or seed tree cutting with high soil 
disturbance sometimes favors the development of 
elderberry in a seral community.  It recovers well 
from heavy grazing in the Great Basin.  For use in 
site stabilization or rehabilitation, seeds may be 
planted directly or seedlings and 1-2-year old stock 
may be transplanted.  It also grows from transplanted 
seedlings, cuttings, and rootstocks.    
  
Elderberry usually is not present in the understory of 
closed-canopy forests, and when fire occurs in these, 
regeneration occurs from seed banks that may occur 
between 2-10 cm deep in the soil, the seeds deposited 
from off-site dispersal or from plants of an earlier 
community.  Fire scarifies the hard seed coat of 
buried seeds and stimulates their germination, which 
usually occurs the first growing season after the fire.  
Subsequent burns may eliminate elderberry since it 
spreads slowly by seed.  Fire kills above-ground parts 
but the root crown may sprout but a severe fire can 
kill the root and stem buds from which sprouting 
occurs.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Uses TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Uses='Ethnobotanic: Only the blue or purple berries of 
elderberry are edible.  Edible berries and flower are 
used for medicine, dyes for basketry, arrow shafts, 
flute, whistles, clapper sticks, and folk medicine.  
The active alkaloids in elderberry plants are 
hydrocyanic acid and sambucine.  Both alkaloids will 
cause nausea so care should be observed with this 
plant.  Elderberries are high in vitamin C.  The red 
berries of other species are toxic and should not be 
gathered. 
 
The wood is hard and has been used for combs, 
spindles, and pegs, and the hollow stems have been 
fashioned into flutes and blowguns.   
 
Elderberries are quite edible.  The blue or purple 
berries are gathered and made into elderberry wine, 
jam, syrup, and pies.  The entire flower cluster can be 
dipped in batter and fried, while petals can be eaten 
raw or made into a fragrant and tasty tea. The flowers 
add an aromatic flavor and lightness to pancakes or 
fritters. 
 
The elderberry is of well-known value to the Indians 
of North America and the many purposes it serves 
(Barrow 1967).  Elderberry is highly prized by both 
Spaniards and Cahuillas.  Throughout the months of 
July and August, the small clusters of berries are 
gathered in large quantities.  These clusters are dried 
carefully on the drying floor and preserved in 
considerable amounts.  When wanted, they are 
cooked into a rich sauce that needs no sweetening.  A 
Cahuilla family, during this season of the year, will 
subsist largely on these messes of &quot.sauco.&quot.  
Frequently, the elderberry was so greatly enjoyed that 
families would live for weeks on little else.  Many 
were dried for use in the winter, and were either re-
cooked or eaten raw.  Elderberries are still highly 
prized for food by modern Indian people.  
 
Elderberry twigs and fruit are employed in creating 
dyes for basketry.  These stems are dyed a very deep 
black by soaking them for a week or so in a wash 
made from the berry stems of the elderberry 
(Barrows 1967).  The Cahuilla split basketry 
materials from the aromatic sumac (Rhus trilobata).  
 
Elderberry branches were used to make the shaft of 
arrows.  Flutes and whistles were constructed by 
boring holes into stems hollowed out with hot sticks. 
Clapper sticks were made by splitting the stem and 
clapping the two halves against each other. Clapper 
sticks were used ceremonially in the round-house to 
accompany singing and dancing. The pith of the 
stems was used as tinder, and the stem itself was 
employed as a twirling stick for starting the fire. 
Hollowed-out elderberry stems can be made into 
squirt guns.  
 
In the middle ages, elderberry was considered a Holy 
Tree capable of restoring good health, keeping good 
health, and as an aid to longevity.

Fruits of blue elderberry are gathered from the wild 
for wine, jellies, candy, pies, and sauces. The plants 
are commercially cultivated for fruit production in 
Oregon.  Sambucus canadensis and S. nigra have 
long been used in the same way, and cultivars of both 
have been developed.  All parts of the elderberry 
plant are considered to be a valuable healing plant in 
many folk medicine traditions (Hutchens 1991, 
Walker et al. 1993. Barrett et al. 1933. Clarke 1977). 
Elderberry flowers contain flavenoids and rutin, 
which are known to improve immune function, 
particularly in combination with vitamin C.  The 
flowers also contain tannins, which account for its 
traditional use to reduce bleeding, diarrhea, and 
congestion. 
 
The flowers are the mildest part of the plant and 
when prepared as a tea, are used to break dry fevers 
and stimulate perspiration, aid headache, indigestion, 
twitching eyes, dropsy, rheumatism, appendix 
inflammation, bladder or kidney infections, colds, 
influenza, consumption (bleeding in lungs), and is 
helpful to newborn babies (Hutchens 1991).  Used as 
a wash, the flowers or leaves are good for wounds, 
sprains, and bruises, as well as for sores on domestic 
animals.  The leaves, which are stronger, have a 
slightly laxative property.  Applied externally, leaves, 
flowers, bark and twigs are excellent as a poultice, 
mixed equally with chamomile, for soreness, 
inflammations, joint stiffness, and to reduce the 
swelling of bee stings.  The flowers and berries, 
employed as a diuretic, can aid arthritis and 
rheumatism.  Steeped in water, the flowers are used 
externally to aid in complexion beauty, tone and 
soften the skin, and lighten freckles or spots.  The 
berry juice made into salve aids burns and scalds.  
The juice taken internally will act as a purgative. 
 
Livestock: Blue elderberry is a useful range plant for 
domestic livestock, but is not equally palatable 
during all seasons.  It usually receives limited 
browsing in the spring and to a much greater extent 
in the late summer and fall.  The leaves are eagerly 
devoured after the first heavy frost in the fall.  
Because many branches are beyond the reach of the 
animals, utilization is less destructive.  Browse 
rating: Good for goats. good to fair for sheep. good to 
poor for deer. fair for cattle. and fair to poor for 
horses (Sampson and Jesperson 1981). 
 
Wildlife: Structurally complex riparian vegetation 
communities provide many different habitats and 
support a diverse array of animal species.  Different 
groups of animals occupy or use the different layers 
of vegetation, and this multi-story arrangement is 
often present nowhere else in the arid landscapes.  
 
 
Canopies of plants growing on stream banks provide 
shade, cooling stream water, while roots stabilize and 
create overhanging banks, providing habitat for fish 
and other aquatic organisms. 
 
Game birds, squirrels and other rodents, and several 
kinds of browsers also feed on the fruit or foliage of 
elderberry.  Bears love to eat the elderberry fruits 
while deer, elk, and moose browse on the stems and 
foliage.  The elderberries are important sources of 
summer food for many kinds of songbirds.  For 
example, the western bluebird, indigo bunting, 
common house finch, red-shafted flicker, ash-
throated flycatcher, black-headed grosbeak, scrub 
jay, Stellar jay, ruby-crowned kinglet, mockingbird, 
red-breasted nuthatch, Bullock’s oriole, hooded 
oriole, song sparrow, white-crowned sparrow, 
western tanager, California thrasher, russet-backed 
thrush, brown towhee, Audubon warbler, cedar 
waxwing, Lewis and Nuttall s woodpecker, wren-tit, 
grouse, pheasant, and pigeons all eat elderberries 
(Martin et al. 1951).  
 
The valley elderberry longhorn beetle (VELB) 
(Desmocerus californicus dimorphus) was listed as 
threatened under The Endangered Species Act on 
August 8, 1980.  The elderberry beetle is endemic to 
moist valley oak riparian woodlands along the 
margins of rivers and streams in the lower 
Sacramento and upper San Joaquin Valley of 
California where elderberry grows.  The primary 
threat to the VELB is loss of habitat, insecticide and 
herbicide use, and lack of elderberry shrubs/trees as a 
food plant for the beetle. The mitigation for VELB 
habitat loss, considered a taking under The 
Endangered Species Act, is quite stringent (U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service Mitigation Guidelines). 
 
In general, longhorn beetles are characterized by 
somewhat elongate and cylindrical bodies with long 
antennae, often in excess of 2/3 of the body length.  
Male VELB have a metallic-green pattern of 4 
oblong maculations, surrounded by a bright red-
orange border. The body length is about 13-21 mm, 
and antennae are about as long as the body.  Females 
are more robust, with body length about 18-25 mm, 
and the dark pattern is not reduced. 
 
Blue elderberry is planted because of its forage and 
cover value, productivity, adaptability, and ease of 
establishment.  It is a useful ground cover for 
stabilizing streambanks and eroding sites.  It provides 
food, cover, perching, and nesting sites for many 
species of birds and food and cover for various other 
wildlife, and it is important as browse for mule deer 
and elk.  In the spring, the leaves may be strongly

scented and less palatable, but they sweeten and 
become more palatable by fall.

small, white to cream, rotate, 5-lobed, with a 
pleasant, yet slightly rancid odor.  Fruit is berry-like, 
5-6 mm wide, with 3-5 nutlets, blue- to purple-black

Variation within the species:  
A recent proposal treats Sambucus caerulea within a 
broader species concept – where it is considered the 
western US segment of S. nigra L., a species 
covering all of North America and extending into 
Europe.  Ssp. canadensis (L.) R. Bolli (= S. 
canadensis L.) is the eastern US entity of S. nigra, 
extending westward into the Great Plains nearly to 
the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains.  Ssp. nigra 
 
 
is the Old World entity but it also occurs in 
Greenland, Newfoundland, and a few other localities 
in northeastern North America.    
 
Several varieties have been described within 
Sambucus caerulea, although they are not currently 
accepted: 
    Var. caerulea  
    Var. neomexicana (Woot.) Rehd.  – New Mexican 
elderberry 
    Var. velutina (Dur. &amp. Hilg.) Schwerin  – Dwarf 
Elder 
 
Some familiar with elderberry in the western US, 
however, remain convinced that more than a single 
entity is represented within “var. caerulea,” differing 
in habitat and biological features (e.g., see 
http://www.laspilitas.com/plants/619.htm).    
 
Distribution: Blue elderberry is common along 
stream banks, river banks, and open places in riparian 
areas lower than &lt. 3000 m.  From west Texas north 
to Montana, western Alberta, and southern British 
Columbia, and all other western states, south into 
northwest Mexico.  For current distribution, please

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Adaptation TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Adaptation='Blue elderberry grows on moist, well-drained sunny 
sites, usually occurring in early seral communities or 
in openings in moist forest habitats (slopes, canyons, 
cliff bases, streamsides, streambanks) and moist areas 
within drier, more open habitats (sagebrush, 
mountain brush, pinyon-juniper, ponderosa pine, 
often along fence rows and roads). at elevations of 3-
3000 meters.  Blue elderberry is a dominant 
understory species in riparian woodlands.  It can 
persist past seral stages as scattered individuals in 
open forests, woodlands, chaparral, or riparian zones.  
This species flowers from May to September and 
fruits from July to October.  Blue elderberry is more 
common on warmer sites than red elderberry 
(Sambucus racemosa), although they overlap in 
habitat preference.   
 
In California, common riparian woodland associates 
are valley oak (Quercus lobata), interior live oak 
(Quercus wislizenii), California walnut (Juglans 
hindsii), and California sycamore (Platanus 
racemosa).  Box elder (Acer negundo), Oregon ash 
(Fraxinus latifolia), alder (Alnus rhombifolia), and 
willow (Salix gooddingii, Salix exigua, Salix 
lasiandra, and Salix laevigata) are particularly 
prevalent in the subcanopy.  Understory species are 
mostly shrubs, including elderberry (Sambucus

mexicana), buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis), 
blackberry (Rubus spp.), and California rose (Rosa 
californica).  Lianas, such as poison oak 
(Toxicodendron diversiloba) and California grape 
(Vitis californica) are a dominant feature.  
Herbaceous vegetation is 1% cover except in 
openings where tall forbs may occur.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Blue elderberry produces a good seed crop almost 
every year.  The seeds are dispersed by birds and 
other animals that eat the fruit.  The seeds have a 
hard seed coat and embryo dormancy and may 
remain viable for up to 16 years in storage.  Without 
pretreatment, seed germination may be delayed from 
2 to 5 years after planting.  Plants may flower and 
fruit after only 2-3 years and can reach full size in 3-4 
years.  They are said to be “short-lived.”  Vegetative 
reproduction is limited to coppicing if the stems are 
killed or injured.   
 
Seeds: 
•  Blue elderberry grows best from seed.  
•  Elderberry fruits are collected when ripe and 
spread in thin layers to dry. 
•  To separate seeds from fruits either 1) run fruit 
through a macerator with water, the pulp and 
empty seeds float. 2) crush, dry and use without 
separating fruits and seeds. and 3) small amounts 
of fruit can be cleaned in a fruit blender. 
•  Elderberry seed can be stored dry at 41 °F for 
several years. 
•  Elderberry seeds can be sown in the fall soon 
after collection, or stratified and sown in the 
spring.  In either case, germination is often not 
complete until the second spring.  
•  A seedling density of 35 plants per square foot is 
sought.  Seeds are sown 1/4 inch deep in drills 
and covered with about 3/8 inch of sawdust 
mulch. 
In the greenhouse, seeds are warm stratified for 
two months in a mixture of peat, vermiculite, and 
sand at 21° to 30°C. (70 to 85°F).  Seeds are then 
placed close to the soil surface in flats in the 
greenhouse.  There are usually several hundred 
seeds in one seed flat. 
Seedlings are then potted from the flats in deep 
3&quot. pots.  
•  After one season of growth, the seedlings are 
field planted in the fall or spring when they are 6 
to 8 months old.  If planted in the fall, irrigation 
may not be necessary in moist sites.  In drier 
sites or with spring planting, irrigation will be 
required for seedling establishment. 
• 
• 
 
Cuttings: 
•  Cuttings of elderberry tend to have lower 
survival success than establishment from seed. 
•  Use hardwood cuttings from previous seasons 
growth.  
•  Take &quot.heel cuttings&quot. from older wood, so inner 
pith is not exposed. 
•  Cuttings should be at least 10&quot., and have at least 
two nodes.  Cuttings should be placed in 4&quot. pots 
with perlite and peat.  Plants should be kept 
moist.  
•  Cuttings have a fragile root system, with high 
mortality occurring when transplanted. Care 
should be taken to be very gentle with delicate 
roots when transplanting. 
•  The cuttings that survive seem to establish and 
grow faster.  Plant biomass production, height, 
flowering and seed set is more rapid than with 
seedlings. 
Transplanting Trees and Stems: 
•  All elderberry plants with evidence of valley 
elderberry longhorn beetle use (i.e. emergence 
holes or presence of adults) should be 
transplanted, as they provide habitat for a 
threatened species under The Endangered 
Species Act.  For further technical information, 
call a representative of the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service. 
•  Cut tree back to 3 to 6 feet from the ground or to 
50 percent of its height (whichever is greater) by 
removing branches and stems above this height.  
The trunk and all stems greater than 1.5 inches in 
diameter can be replanted. 
If the presence of tunnels excavated by the beetle 
larvae inside the elderberry stem and trunk are 
detected, place pruned material next to 
transplanted elderberries. 
•  Move plant by the root ball. Keep the root ball 
• 
wet. 
•  Place transplant in holes 3 to 4 feet deep. 
•  Construct circular water retention basin from the 
excavated earth about 8-10 feet in diameter and 
12 to 14 inches high. Plant the main trunk of an 
elderberry in the center of each water basin. 
Plant other stems that have been rooted around 
the circumference of the basin.  
•  Saturate soil with water.  Irrigate as necessary, 
especially through first growing season.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='In six riparian restoration projects carried out in 
California, competition from exotic weed species was 
a key factor in mortality and site failure (Baird 1989).  
On small sites, hand weeding around trees and shrubs

is the most effective means of weed control.  One 
way to avoid competition from weeds on larger sites 
is to remove the surface soil, although this has the 
disadvantage of removing nutrients, mycorrhizal 
fungi, bacteria, and insect and invertebrate 
populations critical to a healthy habitat.  A cover crop 
of native wildflowers was also used to control weeds, 
with wildflower seeds hand-broadcast over the site.  
On wetter, heavier soils this does not seem to provide 
effective weed control. 
 
There is considerable evidence that fertilization can 
favor exotic weeds over native plants. Inoculation 
with mycorrhizal fungi enables seedlings of some 
species to better utilize limited supplies of both water 
and nutrients.  Inoculation of transplanted shrubs may 
be accomplished through inclusion of large (1.2 m 
deep by 2.8 m wide) root balls with plants.  Smaller, 
more economical soil plugs scattered throughout the 
site serve the same purpose.  The number of soil 
plugs needed to ensure the establishment of soil flora 
is directly related to the distance of the restoration 
site from a similar, mature community. 
 
Given that elderberry provides habitat for the 
federally listed valley longhorn elderberry beetle, 
livestock grazing of elderberry is not recommended.   
Livestock grazing can alter vegetative structure and 
composition of riparian habitat.  Overgrazing by 
livestock and big game frequently changes plant 
species composition and growth form, density of 
stands, vigor, seed production of plants, and insect 
production.  
 
Clear-cutting or seed tree cutting with high soil 
disturbance sometimes favors the development of 
blue elderberry in a seral community.  It recovers 
well from heavy grazing in the Great Basin.  For use 
in site stabilization or rehabilitation, seeds may be 
planted directly or seedlings and 1-2-year old stock 
may be transplanted.  It also grows from transplanted 
seedlings, cuttings, and rootstocks.    
  
Blue elderberry usually is not present in the 
understory of closed-canopy forests. When fire 
occurs in these, regeneration occurs from seed banks 
that may occur between 2-10 cm deep in the soil. The 
seeds deposited are from off-site dispersal or from 
plants of an earlier community.  Fire scarifies the 
hard seed coat of buried seeds and stimulates their 
germination, which usually occurs the first growing 
season after the fire.  Subsequent burns may 
eliminate blue elderberry since it spreads slowly by 
seed.  Fire kills above-ground parts but the root 
crown may sprout. A severe fire can kill the root and 
stem buds from which sprouting occurs.

thatched with the fan-shaped leaves.  Split logs were 
used for flooring.  Immature fronds were bleached in 
the sun, cut into strips, and plaited to make long 
strips, which were used for lashing or sewn together 
to make baskets.  The stiff midribs of the leaves were 
sometimes used to construct ball sticks or racquets.  
Palmetto-thatched houses may still be found in 
Houma country in Louisiana. 
 
Wildlife: Fruits ripen in the late fall and are eaten by 
crows, mockingbirds, warblers, pileated and red-
bellied woodpeckers and squirrels.  Palmetto fruits 
provide 10% to 25% of the diet of raccoons and 
robins in the Southeast.

Palmetto is an evergreen palm tree that can reach 
20m in height.  The erect, unbranched trunk has 
grayish to brownish bark with distinctive pineapple-
like markings where the old leaf stalks were attached.  
Medium-green, stiff, fanlike leaves are palmately 
compound and spread in all directions as they emerge 
from the top of the trunk.  The fans, often wider than 
they are long (2-3 m wide), contain several long and 
pointed leaflets with prominent midribs.  During June 
and July, abundant, small (.5cm), fragrant, white 
flowers are borne upon drooping, branched clusters. 
The berry-like fruits are small (1.5cm), shiny and 
black.   Each fruit contains one seed. 
 
Similar species: The shrub-like, dwarf palmetto 
(Sabal minor) is common to freshwater wetlands of 
the southeastern United States.  The leaves lack the 
prominent midrib and it usually does not grow a 
stem.   
 
Distribution: Native to the Gulf Coast states and 
Florida. For current distribution, please consult the 
Plant Profile page for this species on the PLANTS 
Web site.

saltwater wetlands, wet hammocks, riverbanks, 
seasonally wet prairies, maritime forests and coastal 
plains.  In Florida and across the gulf states, cabbage 
palmetto is commonly found in transition zones 
between active floodplains and uplands.  It also 
occurs in maritime heath communities in the 
Carolinas and Virginia as well as the hardwood 
upland hammocks communities of the Everglades.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Cabbage palmetto is widely planted for landscaping 
as an ornamental because of its stately structure and 
large, graceful fan-shaped fronds.  It has a slow to 
moderate growth rate and is used for street trees as 
well as for the patio or terrace.  It can be grown in 
sun or in part shade.  The tree grows well in a wide 
variety of soils with medium to poor drainage and 
fertility in both moist and fairly dry areas.  It is 
recommended for seaside plantings, as it is tolerant of 
salt.  It is not hardy in mountain areas as it is 
sensitive to cold. 
 
Propagation by seeds: The trees may be easily 
propagated from seed, as they germinate readily.   
 
Transplantings: It is best to transplant cabbage 
palmettos in June or July.  Seedlings can be 
transplanted the year following germination although 
larger plants transplant more easily.  This is because 
increased food reserves stored in the main stem of 
larger transplants help in the regeneration of new 
roots.  Tie the leaves together before transplanting to 
protect the terminal bud.  After transplanting into a 
hole large enough to hold the roots, support the plant 
with stakes.  It is necessary to water frequently until 
you can observe growth, to ensure proper 
establishment of the root system.

SITKA WILLOW 
Salix sitchensis Sanson ex 
Bong. 
Plant Symbol = SASI2 
 
Contributed by: USDA NRCS National Plant Data 
Center 
The Haida used the spring catkins or pussy willows 
of this species as decoration (Ibid.).  The Indians used 
the wood and twigs in drying fish, stretching skins, 
and basket making (Viereck &amp. Little 1972). 
 
Medicinal: Willows are the source of the natural 
precursor to aspirin, salicylic acid, found in leaves 
and bark (Pojar &amp. MacKinnon 1994).  The bark can 
be pounded and applied to wounds as a healing agent 
(Moerman 1998).  An infusion of the stems has been 
used in the treatment of stomach complaints (Ibid.). 
 
Conservation: Sitka willow is used in forested 
riparian buffers to help reduce stream bank erosion, 
protect aquatic environments, enhance wildlife, and 
increase biodiversity.

germinate within twelve to twenty-four hours after 
falling on moist ground (Ibid.).  Seedbeds must be 
kept moist until seedlings are well established. 
 
Propagation by cuttings: Sitka willow can be 
propagated through hardwood cuttings that can be 
collected and prepared for insertion when they are 
well ripened, from November to March.  Cuttings 
seven to ten inches long and a half to one inch thick 
are initially stuck in the ground at close spacing and 
lifted after one year (Dirr &amp. Heuser 1987).  Willow 
cuttings have a rooting percentage of ninety to one- 
hundred percent without the use of rooting hormones 
(Ibid.).

HARDSTEM 
BULRUSH 
The rhizome (underground stem) is used for the black 
element in basket design.  Rhizomes are obtained by 
digging around the plant and following them out 
from the parent plant.  Often the green stalks are cut, 
to make the rooting area more accessible.  Bulrushes 
are called black root by Pomo basket weavers in 
California. the cream-colored rhizome is dyed black 
for basketry designs.  The rhizomes are soaked from 
3 to 6 months with acorns and a piece of iron, ashes 
or walnut husks until a dark brown to black color is 
obtained.  Rhizomes are then stored in coils to dry, 
then woven into coiled baskets.  Only about the 
thickness of a toothpick, the split rhizomes are both 
flexible and strong. 
 
Tule houses were common throughout many parts of 
California. the overlapping tule matters were well-
insulated and rain-proof.  Willow poles, arched and 
anchored into the ground and tied with cordage or 
bark formed the framework.  The walls are thatched 
with mats of tule or cattail and secured to the frame.  
In Nevada, tules and willows were bound together in 
a sort of crude weaving for &quot.Kani&quot., the Paiute name 
for summerhouse.  Tules and cattails were used as 
insulating thatch for structures matting, bedding, and 
roofing materials.  As thatching material, these 
bulrushes were spread out in bundles, tied together, 
then secured in place with poles. 
 
Several California Indian tribes make canoes of tule 
stems bound together with vines from wild grape.  
Groups located near the California coast, on mud 
flats and in marshes, used tule to make large round 
mud-shoes for their feet so they could walk without 
sinking.  They also make dwellings of tule.  Shredded 
tule was used for baby diapers, bedding, and 
menstrual padding.  Women made skirts from tule.   
During inclement weather, men wore shredded tule 
capes, which tied around the neck and was belted at 
the waist.  Duck decoys were made of tule. 
 
Other Uses: Streambank stabilization, wetland 
restoration, wildlife food and shelter, edible (young 
shoots, pollen, seeds, rhizomes), basketry, houses, 
roofing material, matting, bedding, canoes.  These 
native plants are especially good for stabilizing or 
restoring disturbed or degraded (including logged or 
burned) areas, for erosion and slope control, and for 
wildlife food and cover.  Bulrushes may be less 
suitable for general garden use.

Wildlife: The seeds, being less hairy and larger than 
cattail, are one of the most important and commonly 
used foods of ducks and of certain marshbirds and 
shorebirds (Martin et al. 1951).  Bulrushes provide 
choice food for wetland birds: American wigeon, 
bufflehead, mallard, pintail, shoveler, blue-winged 
teal, cinnamon teal, greater scaup, lesser scaup, 
avocet, marbled godwit, clapper rail, Virginia rail, 
sora rail, long-billed dowitcher, and tricolored 
blackbird.  Canada geese and white-fronted geese 
prefer the shoots and roots.  The stems provide 
nesting habitat for blackbirds and marsh wrens.  
Fresh emergent wetlands are among the most 
productive wildlife habitats in California.  They 
provide food, cover, and water for more than 160 
species of birds and numerous mammals, reptiles and 
amphibians.  The endangered Santa Cruz long-toed 
salamander and rare giant garter snake use these 
wetlands as primary habitat.  The endangered 
Aleutian Canada goose, bald eagle, and peregrine 
falcon use these wetlands for feeding and roosting. 
 
Muskrats have evolved with wetland ecosystems and 
form a valuable component of healthy functioning 
wetland communities.  Muskrats use emergent 
wetland vegetation for hut construction and for food.  
Typically, an area of open water is created around the 
huts. Areas eaten out by muskrat increase wetland 
diversity by providing opportunities for aquatic 
vegetation to become established in the open water 
and the huts provide a substrate for shrubs and other 
plant species.  Muskrats opening up the dense stands 
of emergent vegetation also create habitat for other 
species.  Both beaver and muskrats often improve 
wetland habitat.

bulrush, a deciduous herbaceous plant, is 
distinguished by their long cylindric stems from 5 to 
8 feet tall.  The shoots senesce in the winter.  The 
leaves are slender, v-shaped blades that are sheathed 
around the long stem.  The flowers are arranged in a 
spikelet and resemble orange-brown scales.  
Hardstem bulrush has a tight panicle with 3 to many 
spikelets, and the flower bracts are prominently 
spotted.  Bulrushes have clonal growth, with stout 
rootstocks and long, thick, brown rhizomes 
(underground stems).

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Schoenoplectus species may be planted from bare 
rootstock or seedlings from container stalk or directly 
seeded into the soil.  Germination problems have 
been reported in the literature for S. acutus.  
Consequently, live plant collections of this species 
are recommended.  Bare rootstock or seedlings are 
preferred re-vegetation methods where there is 
moving water. 
 
Live Plant Collections: No more than 1/4 of the 
plants in an area should be collected.  If no more than 
0.09 m2 (1 ft2) should be removed from a 0.4 m2 (4 
ft2) area, the plants will grow back into the hole in 
one good growing season.  A depth of 15 cm (6 in) is 
sufficiently deep for digging plugs.  This will leave 
enough plants and rhizomes to grow back during the 
growing season.  
 
Donor plants that are drought-stressed tend to have 
higher revegetation success.  Live transplants should 
be planted as soon as possible in moist (not flooded 
or anoxic) soils.  Plants should be transported and 
stored in a cool location prior to planting.  Plugs may 
be split into smaller units, generally no smaller than 6 
x 6 cm (2.4 x 2.4 in), with healthy rhizomes and tops.  
The important factor in live plant collections is to be 
sure to include a growing bud in either plugs or 
rhizomes.  Weeds in the plugs should be removed by 
hand.  Soil can either be left on the roots of harvested 
material or removed. For ease in transport, soil may 
be washed gently from roots.  The roots should 
always remain moist or in water until planted.  
 
Clip leaves and stems from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 
inches). this allows the plant to allocate more energy 
into root production.  Plant approximately 1 meter 
apart.  Plants should be planted closer together if the 
site has fine soils such as clay or silt, steep slopes, or 
prolonged inundation. 
 
Don t flood plants right away, or the seedlings will 
experience high mortality.  If possible, get the roots 
started before flooding the soils.  Ideally, plants 
should be planted in late fall just after the first rains 
(usually late October to November).  This enables 
 
 

Page 3
plant root systems to become established before 
heavy flooding and winter dormancy occurs.  
Survival is highest when plants are dormant and soils 
are moist.  Fertilization is very helpful for plant 
growth and reproduction.  Many more seeds are 
produced with moderate fertilization. 
 
Seed Collections: Select seed collection sites where 
continuous stands with few intermixed species can 
easily be found.  At each collection location, obtain 
permission for seed collection. 
•  Seed is harvested by taking hand clippers and 
cutting the stem off below the seed heads or 
stripping the seed heads off the stalk.  Hardstem 
bulrush plants tend to hold the seed for a long 
period of time after seeds are mature, so 
harvesting time is more flexible. 
•  Less than 1/2 hour is required to make a decent 
collection of 1 to 2 cups of seed.  The ease of 
collection is affected by water depth. 
•  Collect and store seeds in brown paper bags or 
burlap bags.  Seeds are then dried in these bags. 
•  Seeds and seed heads need to be cleaned in a 
seed cleaner like a Crippen Cleaner. 
•  Plant cleaned seed in fall.  Plant in a clean, 
weed-free, moist seed bed.  Flooded or ponded 
soils will significantly increase seedling 
mortality. 
•  Broadcast seed and roll in or rake 1/4&quot. to 1/2&quot. 
from the soil surface. 
•  Some seed may be lost due to scour or flooding.  
Recommended seed density is unknown at this 
time.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management=' 
Hydrology is the most important factor in 
determining wetland type, revegetation, success, and 
wetland function and value.  Changes in water levels 
influence species composition, structure, and 
distribution of plant communities.  Water 
management is absolutely critical during plant 
establishment, and remains crucial through the life of 
the wetland for proper community management.  
 
Traditional Resource Management: The plant must 
grow in coarse-textured soil free of gravel, clay and 
silt for the roots to be of the quality necessary for 
basket weaving.  Plants are tended by gathering and 
reducing the density between plants for longer 
rhizome production.  Sustainable harvesting of plants 
occurs through limiting harvest in any given area.  
Fire is used to manage tule wetlands to remove old 
stems and restore open water to the wetland.  This 
stimulates growth of new shoots from rhizomes and 
provides a bare soil substrate for seed germination.  
 
Many Native Americans feel the use of herbicides is 
inappropriate in traditional gathering sites.  Bulrush 
is densely rhizomatous with abundant seed 
production.  In most cases, it will out-compete other 
species within the wetland area of the site, 
eliminating the need for manual or chemical control 
of invasive species.  Heavy grazing will eliminate 
Schoenoplectus species as well as other native 
species.

Tule houses were common throughout many parts of 
California with the overlapping tule matters being 
well-insulated and rain-proof.  Willow poles, arched 
and anchored into the ground and tied with cordage 
or bark, formed the framework.  The walls were 
thatched with mats of tule or cattail and secured to 
the frame.  In Nevada, tules and willows were bound 
together in a sort of crude weaving for &quot.Kani&quot., the 
Paiute name for summerhouse.  
 
Tules and cattails were used as insulating thatch for 
structures, matting, bedding, and roofing materials.  
Shredded tule was used for baby diapers, bedding, 
and menstrual padding.  Women made skirts from 
tule.  During inclement weather, men wore shredded 
tule capes, which tied around the neck and was belted 
at the waist.  Duck decoys were made of tule.  
Several California Indian tribes made canoes of tule 
stems bound together with vines from wild grape.  
Groups located near the California coast used tule to 
make large round mud-shoes so they could walk 
without sinking.  
 
Other Uses: Streambank stabilization, wetland 
restoration, wildlife food and shelter, edible (young 
shoots, pollen, seeds, rhizomes), and matting.  These 
native plants are especially good for stabilizing or 
restoring disturbed or degraded (including logged or 
burned) areas, for erosion and slope control, and for 
wildlife food and cover.  Bulrushes may be less 
suitable for general garden use.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Uses='Ethnobotanic: Bulrush is similar to the cattail in 
edibility, although it is purportedly sweeter.  Young 
shoots coming up in the spring can be eaten raw or 
cooked.  Bulrush pollen is eaten as flour in bread, 
mush or pancakes.  Later in the season, the seeds can 
be beaten off into baskets or pails, ground into a 
similar meal and used as flour.  The large rhizomes 
are eaten raw or cooked. sometimes they were dried 
in the sun, then pounded into a kind of flour.  
Schoenoplectus validus (synonym: Scirpus validus), a 
similar species, has as much as 8% sugar and 5.5% 
starch in rhizomes, but less than 1% protein 
(Harrington 1972). 
 
The rhizome (underground stem) is used for the black 
element in basket design.  Rhizomes are obtained by 
digging around the plant and following them out 
from the parent plant.  Often the green stalks are cut, 
to make the rooting area more accessible.  Bulrushes 
are called black root by Pomo basketweavers in 
California. the cream-colored rhizome is dyed black 
for basketry designs.

bulrush, a perennial herbaceous plant, is 
distinguished by long triangular or subterete stems 
from 5 to 8 feet tall.  The leaves are slender, v-shaped 
blades that are sheathed around the long stem.  The 
flowers are arranged in a spikelet and resemble 
orange-brown scales.  The inflorescence of California 
bulrush is a larger and more open panicle than 
hardstem bulrush, with 20 to many spikelets, and it is 
consistently a reddish brown color.  Bulrushes have 
clonal growth, with stout rootstocks and long, thick, 
brown rhizomes (underground stems).

in freshwater marshes along the California coast from 
San Diego County to Napa County, inland in the 
Central Valley, occasional in the Mojave Desert, east 
to South Carolina, Florida, temperate South America 
and the Hawaiian Islands (Hickman 1993).

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Schoenoplectus species may be planted from bare 
rootstock or seedlings from container stalk or directly 
seeded into the soil.  Germination problems have 
been reported in the literature for some 
Schoenoplectus (synonym: Scirpus) species.  
Consequently, live plant collections of this species 
are recommended.  
 
Live Plant Collections: No more than 1/4 of the 
plants in an area should be collected.  If no more than 
0.09 m2 (1 ft2) are removed from a 0.4 m2 (4 ft2) 
area, the plants will grow back into the hole in one 
good growing season.  A depth of 15 cm (6 in) is 
sufficiently deep for digging plugs.  This will leave 
enough plants and rhizomes to grow back during the 
growing season.  Donor plants that are drought-
stressed tend to have higher re-vegetation success. 
 
 
 
Live transplants should be planted as soon as possible 
in moist (not flooded or anoxic) soils.  Plants should 
be transported and stored in a cool location prior to 
planting.  Plugs may be split into smaller units, 
generally no smaller than 6 x 6 cm (2.4 x 2.4 in), with 
healthy rhizomes and tops.  The important factor in 
live plant collections is to be sure to include a 
growing bud in either plugs or rhizomes.  Weeds in 
the plugs should be removed by hand.  Soil can either 
be left on the roots of harvested material or removed.  
For ease in transport, soil may be washed gently from 
roots.  The roots should always remain moist or in 
water until planted.  
 
Clip the leaves and stem from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 
inches).  This allows the plant to allocate more 
energy into root production.  Plant approximately 1 
meter apart.  Plants should be planted closer together 
if the site has fine soils such as clay or silt, steep 
slopes, or prolonged inundation.  Don t flood plants 
right away, or the seedlings will experience high 
mortality.  Get the roots started before flooding soils 
if possible.  Ideally, plants should be planted in late 
fall just after the first rains (usually late October to 
November).  This enables plant root systems to 
become established before heavy flooding and winter 
dormancy occurs.  Survival is highest when plants are 
dormant and soils are moist.  Fertilization is very 
helpful for plant growth and reproduction.  Many 
more seeds are produced with moderate fertilization. 
 
Seed Collections:  
•  Select seed collection sites where continuous 
stands with few intermixed species can easily be 
found. 
•  At each collection location, obtain permission for 
seed collection. 
Seed is harvested by either taking hand clippers 
or cutting the stem off below the seed heads or 
stripping the seed heads off the stalk.  
from the soil surface. 
•  Less than 1/2 hour is required to make a decent 
collection of 1 to 2 cups of seed.  The ease of 
collection is affected by water depth. 
•  Collect and store seeds in brown paper bags or 
burlap bags.  Dry the seeds in these bags. 
•  Seeds and seed heads need to be cleaned in a 
seed cleaner.  Plant cleaned seed in fall.  Plant in 
clean, weed - free, moist seed bed.  Flooded or 
ponded soils will significantly increase seedling 
mortality. 
•  Broadcast seed and roll in or rake 1/4&quot. to 1/2&quot.

•  Some seed may be lost due to scour or flooding.  
Recommended seed density is unknown at this 
time. 
   Seed germination in greenhouse: 
•  Clean seed - blow out light seed. 
•  To germinate seeds, plant in greenhouse in 1&quot. x 
1&quot. x 2&quot. pots, 1/4&quot. under the soil surface.  Keep 
soil surface moist at a temperature of 100 
degrees F (plus or minus 5 degrees).  Seeds 
begin to germinate after a couple weeks in warm 
temperatures.   
•  Plants are ready in 100 - 120 days to come out as 
plugs.  By planting seeds in August, plugs are 
ready to plant in soil by November.  These plants 
are very small. growing plants to a larger size 
will result in increased re-vegetation success.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='Hydrology is the most important factor in 
determining wetland type, revegetation, success, and 
wetland function and value.  Changes in water levels 
influence species composition, structure, and 
distribution of plant communities.  Water 
management is absolutely critical during plant 
establishment, and remains crucial through the life of 
the wetland for proper community management.  
Heavy grazing will eliminate Schoenoplectus species 
as well as other native species.  
 
Muskrats have evolved with wetland ecosystems and 
form a valuable component of healthy functioning 
wetland communities.  Muskrats use emergent 
wetland vegetation for hut construction and for food.  
An area of open water is created around the huts, 
which  increase wetland diversity by providing 
opportunities for aquatic vegetation to become 
established.  Muskrats opening up the dense stands of 
emergent vegetation also create habitat for other 
species.  Both beaver and muskrats often improve 
wetland habitat. 
 
Traditional Resource Management: The plant must 
grow in coarse-textured soil that is free of gravel, 
clay and silt for the roots to be of the quality 
necessary for basketweaving.  Plants are tended by 
gathering rhizomes and reducing plant density.  
Sustainable harvesting of plants occurs through 
limiting harvest in any given area.  Fire was also used 
to manage tule wetlands. fire eliminated decadent old 
stems and restored open water to the wetland.  This 
stimulates growth of new shoots from rhizomes and 
provides a bare soil substrate for seed germination.  
Many Native Americans feel the use of herbicides is 
inappropriate in traditional gathering sites.  Bulrush 
is densely rhizomatous with abundant seed 
production.  In most cases, it will out-compete other 
species within the wetland area of the site, 
eliminating the need for manual or chemical control 
of invasive species.

food”  and  very  likely  saw  palmetto  was  one  of  them. 
Evidence for saw palmetto use is widespread in  
coastal  archaeological  sites  in  southern  and  central 
Florida,  being  an  extremely  important  food  for  Florida’s 
pre-Columbian peoples ( McGoun  1993 cited in Bennett 
and  Hicklin  1998).  The  seeds  of  these  fruits  also  are 
found  at  sites  in  northern  Florida  and  in  the  Lower 
Mississippi Valley (Alexander 1984 and Kidder and Fritz 
1993 cited in Scarry 2003).  
 
The  Choctaw,  Koasati,  Miccosukee,  and  Seminole  used 
and continue to use the split leaf petioles for basketry 
(Bennett  and  Hicklin  1998.  Bushnell  1909.  Colvin  2006. 
Sturtevant 1955:504). Thomas Colvin (2006:80) describes 
the  sustainable  harvest  practices  of  the  Choctaw  that  he 
learned from the Johnsons: “The best palmetto (Serrenoa 
serrulata)  [now  Serenoa  repens]  grows  where  the  marsh 
meets  the  swamp  or  bayou.  When  cutting  it,  I  always 
leave  stalks  with  one  or  two  green  fronds,  as  well  as  the 
center  growing  core  of  the  plant,  as  the  Johnsons 
[Choctaw] taught me to do, so that the plant will not die. 
This  can  be  done  twice  each  year.  Palmetto  baskets  are 
made  from  the  cortical  layer  of  the  stalks,  not  from  the 
fronds.”  The  Choctaw  remove  the  rigid  teeth  from  the 
petioles and split the stalks into five or six straws, peeled 
and trimmed them to the proper width, and dried them in 
the  sun.  They  might  be  then  dyed  black,  red,  or  yellow. 
Sifters, pack, heart, and elbow baskets all carry its leaves. 
The  Seminole  pounded  corn  into  a  powder,  sifted  it 
through  woven  palmetto  fibers,  and  then  placed  it  in  a 
kettle  of  boiling  water  to  make  a  porridge  called  sofkee 
(Covington 1993).

Alternate Name   Palmetto  
Uses 
Cultural:  Saw  palmetto  featured  prominently  in  the 
material  cultures  of  some  Southeastern 
tribes.  The 
Tequesta, Creek, Miccosukee, and Seminole gathered and 
ate the berries in late summer or fall (Bennett and Hicklin 
1998.  Tebeau  1968.  Rusby  1906).  Romans  (1999:145) 
said  in  1775  in  reference  to  the  Creek:  “…  they  dry 
peaches  and  persimmons,  chestnuts  and  the  fruit  of  the 
chamaerops  [Serenoa  repens].”  The  young,  sweet,  and 
tender  shoots  are  also  edible  (Small  1926).  Naturalist 
William  Bartram  (1996:559),  in  his  travels  in  the 
Southeastern  United  States  in  the  1770s,  noted  that  there 
were  “several  species  of  palms,  which  furnish  them 
[tribes]  with  a  great  variety  of  agreeable  and  nourishing

The Seminole used the leaves for bedding in a temporary 
camp.  The  Chitimacha,  Choctaw,  Houma,  Miccosukee, 
and  Seminole  thatched  their  houses  with  either  saw 
palmetto  leaves  or  the  leaves  of  Sabal  minor  or  Sabal 
palmetto.  (Bushnell  1909.  Campisi  2004.  Sweeny  1936. 
Bennett  and  Hicklin  1998).  The  Miccosukee  and 
Seminole  made  and  continue  to  make  dance  fans  and 
rattles used in ceremonies and toy dolls for children out of 
saw  palmetto  (Bennett  and  Hicklin  1998.  Sturtevant 
1955).

is  used 
  
 
The  plant  provided  punk  for  lighting  fires  and  the  broad 
leaves made a kind of fire fan for fanning fires (Sturtevant 
1955). Seminole fish drags, rope, and brushes were made 
out of the palm fibers from leaf sheaths, stems, and roots 
(Sturtevant 1955:504). 
In  early  Materia  Medicas,  the  berries  were  used  by  non-
Indians to treat all diseases of the reproductive glands, as 
an  aid  to  digestion,  and  to  combat  colds  and  chronic 
bronchitis  of  lung  asthma  (Hutchens  1973).  Today  saw 
palmetto 
reduce 
inflammation and for treatment of prostate disorders such 
as prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), an enlarged prostate gland 
condition common in older men (Sosnowska and Balslev 
2009). Harvesting of fruits from pinelands has heightened 
in the last fifteen years and saw palmetto supplements are 
widely  available  in  health  food  stores  (Carrington  and 
Mullahey  2006).  Although  uncommon,  complications 
from  the  use  of  saw  palmetto  include  intraoperative 
hemorrhage, 
nausea, 
vomiting,  and  diarrhea,  as  well  as  additive  anticoagulant 
effects  and  prolong  bleeding  time  (Integrative  Medicine 
Service  of  Memorial  Sloan-Kettering  Cancer  Center 
2008).

Non-Indian  settlers  split  saw  palmetto  leaves  into  shreds 
and  boiled  them  and  dried  them  in  the  sun  one  or  two 
days and made them into durable mattresses and pillows. 
The leaves were also collected, dried, put up in bales and 
sold for paper stock in the late 1800s and the strong roots 
were  made  into  scrubbing  brushes  (Hale  1898).  African-
Americans  made  palmetto  hats  for  Southern  soldiers 
(Porcher 1991). 
Saw palmetto is often viewed as an  impediment to cattle 
grazing and farming (Carrington and Mullahey 2006), but 
there  are  some  exceptions.  It  is  an  important  component 
in the winter diet of cattle in south Florida rangelands and 
sheep  grazing  has  been  used  in  Florida  to  control  saw 
palmetto  (Kalmbacher  et  al.  1984.  Marshall  et  al.  2008).   
One  study  that  evaluated  saw  palmetto  for  biomass 
potential  found  that  the  low  biomass  yields  and  high 
concentrations  of  extractives  and  lignin  indicate  that  saw 
palmetto  does  not  have  the  desired  characteristics  for 
biomass energy conversion (Pitman 1992). Saw palmetto 
can  be  planted  for  watershed  protection,  erosion  control, 
and  phosphate-mine  reclamation  (Callahan  et  al.  1990 
cited in Van Deelen 1991).  
 
Wildlife:  Ecologically,  saw  palmetto 
labeled  a 
“keystone  species”  in  southeastern,  and  particularly 
Florida  ecosystems  (Carrington  and  Mullahey  2006). 
Over  100  animal  species  use  saw  palmetto  for  nesting, 
foraging, or for cover (Maehr and Layne 1996). Both the 
threatened Florida panther (Felis concolor ssp. coryi) and 
the threatened Florida black bear (Ursus americanus ssp. 
floridanus)  use  colonies  of  saw  palmetto  as  cover.  Black 
bears  have  their  young  in  the  protective  cover  of  dense 
plants  (Bennett  and  Hicklin  1998).  Florida  burrowing 
owls  (Athene  cunicularia  floridana)  excavate  burrows  in 
saw  palmetto  patches  (Mrykalo  et  al.  2007).  Located  in 
the  dry  prairies  of  southern  Florida  with  scattered 
palmettos,  are 
the 
savannarum 
grasshopper 
pratensis) and the sedge wren (Cistothorus platensis), that 
overwinter 
  there  (Butler  et  al.  2009).  Bachman’s 
sparrows (Aimophila aestivalis) use saw palmetto clumps 
as  shelter  to  escape  from  predators  (Dean  and  Vickery 
2003).  Beach  mice  (Peromyscus  polionotus)  use  clumps 
of palmetto as cover (Extine and Stout 1987). Cotton mice 
(Peromyscus  gossypinus)  and  golden  mice  (Ochrotomys 
nuttalli)  build  spherical  nests  of  saw  palmetto  fibers 
(Frank  and  Layne  1992).  Saw  palmetto  flowers  attract 
several  hundred  species  of  pollinators  (Carrington  et  al. 
2003).  
In 1898, Hale (1898:8) commented on the “great fattening 
properties of the berries” for wildlife. Saw palmetto fruits 
are  high  in  crude  fiber,  potassium,  ash,  fats,  and  sodium 
and  serve  as  an  energy-rich  food  for  raccoons  (Procyon 
lotor),  gray  foxes  (Urocyon  cinereoargenteus),  rats, 
gopher  tortoises  (Gopherus  poloyphemus),  opossums 
(Didelphis  marsupialis),  white-tailed  deer  (Odocoileus 
virginianus),  wild 
(Meleagris  gallopavo), 
bobwhite  quail  (Colinus  virginianus),  black  bears  (Ursus

1951). Fish and  waterfowl also consume the fleshy  fruits 
(Hale  1898).  In  Florida,  saw  palmetto  berries  are  the 
single  most  important  food  to  black  bears  (Maehr  2001). 
In Okefenokee, for example, black gum (Nyssa sylvatica) 
and saw palmetto fruits were the most important foods for 
the  Florida  black  bears  based  on  scat  analysis.  These  are 
such  important  foods,  they  govern  bear  population 
dynamics  (cub  production)  (Dobey  et  al.  2005).  Florida 
box  turtles  (Terrapene  carolina  bauri)  also  feed  on  their 
fruits  and  passage  of  the  seeds  through  the  turtles’ 
digestive

percentage and germination rate (Liu et al. 2004). Wasps 
(Mischocyttarus  mexicanus  cubicola)  nest  on 
the 
underside of horizontally-oriented leaves of saw palmetto 
in  Florida  (Hermann  et  al.  1985).  Red  widow  spiders 
(Latrodectus bishopi) in Florida scrub build silken retreats 
in  saw  palmetto  leaves  (Carrel  2001).  Mortality  of  saw 
palmetto on restoration sites can be due to animal rooting 
of the forming rhizome by feral pigs (Sus scrofa)  
(Schmalzer et al. 2002).

Description 
General: Palm family (Arecaceae). Saw palmetto is a low 
shrubby  palm  with  a  creeping,  horizontal,  simple  or 
branched  stem.  Long-lived,  some  of  the  larger  palms  are 
centuries  old  (Abrahamson  1995).  The  leaves  are  fan-
shaped, up to one meter across, and are divided into 18-30 
segments  (Radford  et  al.  1968.  Hale  1898).  They  have 
petioles  up  to  1.5  m  in  length  nearly  always  with  sharp, 
rigid  recurved  teeth  (Radford  et  al.  1968).  Fertile  ramets 
produce  between  one  and  five  inflorescences  with  small, 
cream-colored and fragrant flowers that have three petals 
and  six  stamens.  The  edible  fruit  is  a  drupe,  bluish  to 
black  when  ripe  between  August  and  October,  and 
resembling  black  olives  in  size  and  shape  (Zona  2000. 
Bombardelli  and  Morazzoni  1997.  Hutchens  1973. 
Bennett  and  Hicklin  1998).  Like  all  palms,  saw  palmetto 
has  roots  that  are  mycorrhizal,  enabling  it  to  grow  on 
nutrient poor native soil (Fisher and Jayachandran 1999).  
 
Distribution:    This  palm  occurs  in  Louisiana,  Alabama, 
Mississippi,  Georgia,  South  Carolina,  and  Florida  (Zona 
2000).  Both  William  Bartram  and  Edwin  Hale  wrote 
about the palmetto scrubs extending unbroken for miles in 
the  Southeastern  United  States  (Bartram  1996.  Hale 
1898).  For  current  distribution,  please  consult  the  Plant 
Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
 
Habitat:  The  plant  is  the  most  common  palm  in  the 
United  States  and  grows  in  a  wide  variety  of  habitats 
including  flatwoods,  prairies,  scrub,  mesic  hammocks, 
maritime  forests,  short-hydroperiod  swamps  and  sandy 
dunes  (Bennett  and  Hicklin  1998.  Zona  2000).  Saw 
palmetto  occurs  on  a  range  of  sites  from  xeric  to  hydric 
and  a  diversity  of  soils  from  strongly  acidic  to  alkaline 
(McNab and Edwards, Jr. 1980). It is often the dominant 
shrub in the understory of Pinus elliottii, P. serotina, and 
P.  palustris  flatwoods  (Bennett  and  Hicklin  1998.  Monk 
1965).  Many  of  these  plant  communities  have  evolved 
with frequent lightning and Indian-set fires. For example, 
upland  Florida  shrublands  dominated  by  clonal  oaks 
intermixed with palmettos and other shrubs have evolved 
with  fire  (Myers  1990.  Schmalzer  and  Hinkle  1992).  In 
the  absence  of  fire,  it  is  disappearing  as  slow  structural 
changes  in  the  vegetation  result  in  diffuse  ecotones  and 
less  habitat  heterogeneity  (Boughton  et  al.  2006).  Fire 
return intervals in coastal plain savannas are every two to 
eight  years,  and  one  to  10  years  in  xeric  sand  hills 
(Christensen  1981  and  Glitzenstein  et  al.  1995  cited  in 
Wagner 2003). Flatwoods are dominated by saw palmetto 
and  slash  pines  (Pinus  elliottii)  and  typically  burn  every 
2-9  years  (Schafer  and  Mack  2010).  In  certain  plant 
communities, such as the dry prairies of Southern Florida, 
the  absence  of  frequent  fire  can  favor  the  domination  of 
saw palmetto. Without fire every one to three  years,  saw 
palmettos  exclude  other  grass  and  forb  species  and 
dominate the landscape (Butler et al. 2009).

open  to  increase  visibility  and  movement,  drive  game, 
increase palatability, accessibility, and nutrition of forage 
plants  for  ungulates,  clear  areas  for  farming,  and  other 
purposes (Stewart 2002).

Several  of  the  habitats  where  saw  palmetto  is  found, 
Florida scrub, longleaf pine forests, loblolly-shortleaf pine 
hardwood forests, and prairies are rare and declining due 
to  conversion 
to  agriculture,  development,  and  the 
absence or prevention of fire (Noss et al. 1995. Schmalzer 
et al. 2002). Agriculture, both Native American and Euro-
American, resulting in cleared fields, may have kept areas 
relatively  free  of  saw  palmetto  on  Cumberland  Island 
National Seashore, Georgia (Bratton and Miller 1994). 
  
 
Adaptation 
Studies show saw palmetto not only thrives in a fire-prone 
environment,  but  is  also  activated  reproductively  by  fire. 
Saw  palmetto  has  waxy,  evergreen  leaves  that  are  quite 
flammable.    After  fire,  the  plant  resprouts  from  root 
crowns  and  rhizomes  and  grows  rapidly  (Abrahamson 
1984.  1999.  Van  Deelen  1991.  Schmalzer  and  Hinkle 
1992). Winter-burned stands recover faster than summer-
burned  stands  (Abrahamson  1984).  However,  seedlings 
grow  slowly,  especially  on  nutrient-poor  soils,  and  they 
have  a  limited  ability  to  recolonize  former  habitats 
(Abrahamson 1995).  
 
Establishment 
Ripe fruit can be gathered by hand-picking or cutting the 
fruit-bearing  panicle  (Van  Deelen  1991).  Saw  palmetto 
seeds  have  low  and  slow  germination  rates.  In  one  trial, 
soaked or imbibed seeds held for one week at 35 degrees 
C  provided  the  highest  germination  when  seeds  were 
subsequently  planted  in  sterile  quartz  media  kept  at  30 
degrees C in a  greenhouse (Carpenter 1987). D.J. Makus 
(2008) found that germination of saw palmetto seeds can 
be  heightened  by  removal  of  any  fleshy  material  around 
the  seeds,  washing  the  seeds,  and  soaking  them  in  water 
for  24  hours  before  sowing  them  in  a  germination 
medium.  Outplanting  the  seeds  in  a  lighter  textured  soil 
resulted  in  improved  plant  height  by  20  percent  and  a 
two-fold  increase  in  fruit  yield  by  the  sixth  year  (Makus 
2008). 
Management 
Because  flowering  is  connected  to  fire,  saw  palmetto 
stands  under  conservation  protection  need 
to  be 
prescription  burned  to  maintain  population  viabilities 
(Abrahamson  1999).  Fire  not  only  induces  flowering  in 
appropriately sized individuals, it also influences whether 
that  stimulus  will  result  in  inflorescences  via  overstory 
canopy  reduction  and  enhancement  of  available  light 
(Abrahamson  1999).  Burning  saw  palmetto  understories 
every  3  to  5  years,  will  maintain  fruit  production  for 
white-tailed  deer  (Fults  1991 cited  in  Van  Deelen  1991). 
Additionally,  controlled  harvesting  of  the  berries  for 
modern medicine will leave fruits for wildlife populations 
that  also  depend  on  nutrient-rich  palmetto 
fruits 
(Abrahamson 1999).  Managing areas  with  fire to include 
both longer and shorter fire intervals will create a diverse 
landscape mosaic, taking into account old palmetto stands 
 
that  bears  and  panthers  use  as  cover  for  dens  (Conway 
Duever 2011).

Control 
Please contact  your local agricultural extension specialist 
or county weed specialist to learn what works best in your 
area  and  how  to  use  it  safely.  Always  read  label  and 
safety instructions for each control  method. Trade names 
and  control  measures  appear  in  this  document  only  to 
provide  specific  information.  USDA  NRCS  does  not 
guarantee  or  warrant  the  products  and  control  methods 
named, and other products may be equally effective. 
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
Commercial sources of saw palmetto seeds are frequently 
available (Van Deelen 1991). This plant is available from 
native  plant  nurseries  and  is  widely  planted  as  an 
ornamental  (Bennett  and  Hicklin  1998).  It  grows  slowly 
though and doesn’t transplant easily (Bennett and Hicklin 
1998.  Abrahamson  1995).  Also  check  with  your  local 
NRCS  Plant  Materials  Center  for  possible  sources  of 
existing plant materials.

silvery hairs and rusty brown spots on the 
undersurface (Pojar &amp. MacKinnon 1994).  The 
flowers are small, yellowish or brownish, male and 
female flowers on separate shrubs.  The fruits are 
drupelike, red or yellowish, ovoid achenes, that are 
fleshy and edible but almost tasteless or bitter 
(Viereck &amp. Little 1972). 
 
Distribution: Buffaloberry is found from 
Newfoundland to Alaska, south to Maine, to western 
New York, Ohio, and northern Mexico.  For current 
distribution, please consult the PLANTS profile page 
for this species on the PLANTS Web site.

Shepherdia canadensis occurs in dry to moist open 
woods and thickets, from lowlands to middle 
elevation forests (Pojar &amp. MacKinnon 1994).  It 
prefers moist to wet soil and is generally found on 
rocky, sandy, or gravelly soils and is able to survive 
on nutrient poor soils because of its nitrogen fixing 
ability.  This species prefers partial shade or partial 
sun to full sun.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Propagation by Seed: Buffaloberry seeds should be 
harvested in the autumn and sown immediately in a 
cold frame.  The seeds must not be allowed to dry 
out.  Seeds have a hard seed coat and scarification 
with sulfuric acid for twenty to thirty minutes 
followed by two to three months of cold stratification 
will help the embryo to develop (Dirr &amp. Heuser 
1987).  Place the seedlings into individual pots when 
they are large enough to handle.  If sufficient growth 
is made by the summer, it is possible to plant them 
out, otherwise grow them in a cold frame for the first 
winter and out plant the following spring or early 
summer.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Uses='Ethnobotanic: Buffaloberry berries were used to 
make “Indian ice cream” which has a bitter taste but 
was often sweetened with salal berries, camas bulbs, 
or hemlock cambium (Pojar &amp. MacKinnon 1994).  
The berries were also eaten fresh or dried.   
 
The Wet’suwet’en used the twigs, leaves, berries, and 
juice medicinally for everything from heart attacks to 
indigestion.  The berries were also chewed by 
Wet’suwet’en women to induce childbirth.  The 
Salish and Kootenai tribes boiled debarked branches 
and used the solution as eyewash.  A poultice of the 
inner bark, softened by hot water and mixed with pin 
cherry bark (Prunus pensylvanica) has been used to 
make a plaster or bandage for wrapping broken limbs 
(Moerman 1998). 
 
Landscaping &amp. Wildlife: Shepherdia canadensis 
plants are grown occasionally for ornamental use.  
The berries are browsed by grouse, black bears, 
grizzly bears, and snowshoe hares.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Description='General: Legume Family (Fabaceae).  Trailing 
fuzzybean is an native, herbaceous annual vine.  The 
plant has a fuzzy stem from 1-3 m in length.  Young 
stems are erect and become trailing or twining as they 
grow.  Leaflets are 2-5.5 cm long and ovate to ovate-
oblong in shape.  The leaves can often have three 
lobes.  The purple-pea flowers are borne at the top of 
long, naked stalks.  Blooms fade with time to include 
shades of green.  The flowers are 8-13mm long.  The 
long, fuzzy pods (4-10 cm long) contain several 
pubescent seeds that are black and shiny with 
removal of the fuzzy outer coat.  The plants bloom 
from summer to fall.  The seed pods shatter, 
dispersing the seeds, when the seeds are ripe.   
 
Distribution: For current distribution, please consult 
the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site.   
 
Habitat: Trailing fuzzybean can be found along the 
banks of rivers, in damp thicket, in open woodlands, 
low places between coastal dunes, fields, abandoned 
cropland and roadsides.

crown narrowly conic to broadly pyramidal, with 
spreading, densely crowded branches. branchlets 
flattened, in fan-shaped sprays.  Bark is gray to 
reddish-brown, 6-9 mm thick, fibrous, separated into 
flat, connected ridges.  Leaves are evergreen, scale-
like and abruptly pointed, 2 mm long, opposite in 
alternating pairs (in 4 rows), bright green above and 
pale green below, sometimes becoming yellow-
brown in winter, with a spicy fragrance when 
crushed.  Seed cones are ellipsoid, (6-)9-14 mm long, 
brown. seeds ca. 8 per cone, 4-7 mm long, with 
lateral wings about as wide as the body.  The 
common name pertains to its northern distribution, 
cedar-like appearance, and white wood.   
  
Variation within the species: ecotypic variation 
within the species has been documented but no 
naturally occurring variants have been formally 
recognized.  Significant genetic variation has favored 
the artificial selection of many cultivars, which differ 
primarily in leaf color and growth habit.   
 
Northern white cedar differs from western red-cedar 
(Thuja plicata) in leaf color (dull yellowish-green on 
both surfaces), minutely mucronate scales of the seed 
cones, and geography.

Wildlife: Stands of northern white cedar also are 
valuable for wildlife habitat, particularly in severe 
winters for white-tailed deer, which use it for both 
shelter and browse.  These trees also provide habitats 
for many species of birds.   
 
Industry: The wood’s light weight and resistance to

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Cones may be produced by northern white-cedars as 
young as 6 years old, but seed production in large 
quantities begins when the trees are about 30 years 
old and is best after 75 years.  Good seed crops are 
produced at intervals of 2 to 5 years, or more 
frequently in local areas.   
 
Seedbeds of moss-covered, decaying logs and stumps 
account for more than 70 percent of the northern 
white-cedar seedlings in undisturbed areas.  
Seedlings can be established on burns, if the burn 
was severe enough to expose favorable, mineral soil 
seedbeds on uplands or to improve moss seedbeds in 
swamps.  Best root and shoot development occur in 
full light, but drought-caused mortality of northern 
white cedar seedlings may be extremely high under 
any light condition.  
 
Layering may account for a significant portion of 
northern white-cedar reproduction in swamps, 
because adventitious roots can be produced from any 
branch or stem.  It is most common in young stands 
and those with leaning trees, where the lower 
branches become covered by moss.  New trees also 
develop vegetatively from uprooted trees where roots 
are formed from vertical branches.   
 
Northern white cedar grows relatively slowly in 
swamps or on other saturated lowland sites, but it 
apparently reaches ages of 400 years and greater in 
these habitats.  An individual from Ontario has been 
dated at more than 1650 years old.

stands that have been opened by timber harvesting or 
severely browsed by white-tailed deer, succession is 
often to balsam fir or swamp hardwoods, especially 
black ash.  Northern white-cedar responds well to 
thinning-release after successful establishment, 
although it is shade tolerant and can withstand severe 
suppression for several years.    
 
Even-aged management, through shelterwood cutting 
or clear cutting is recommended for maximum 
benefit to deer.  Satisfactory reestablishment after 
clearcutting often requires some kind of site 
preparation, particularly broadcast burning of slash.  
In some areas, however, heavy winter browsing of 
seedlings and saplings by deer greatly reduces 
reproductive success.

depressions), but on a variety of landforms, including 
rocky slopes, at 0-1500 (-2300) meters elevation.  
They usually occur in mixed coniferous forests, 
rarely in pure stands.  In cultivation, they prefer 
moist, acid, well-drained soils but have been grown 
in heavy clays of the Midwest.   
 
' WHERE symbol='thpl';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Cone production begins in open-grown trees of 
western red cedar at about 10-20 years of age but 
peak production occurs after 70-80 years and may 
continue for several centuries.  Good seed crops are 
produced at intervals of 2-3 years.   
 
In clearcuts and other disturbed areas, seedlings 
account for most of the western red-cedar 
regeneration, but seedlings in mature stands may be 
less abundant than individuals produced by 
vegetative reproduction from layering, rooting of 
fallen branches, and branch development on fallen 
trees.  Disturbed mineral soil seems to be a major 
requirement for regeneration from seed.  Unburned 
soil provides better seedbed than scorched soil, but 
slash burning may create mineral soil surfaces in cut-
over areas.  In mature stands of western red cedar, 
rotten wood in contact with the soil provides an 
effective seedbed.  Partial shade, which lowers 
evaporation and soil temperature, is beneficial to 
seedling growth.   
 
Western red cedar is often present in pioneer, seral, 
and climax stages of forest succession.  Vegetative 
regeneration may be predominant in ecologically 
stable communities, but wide seed distribution allows 
it to invade disturbed areas.  It is highly shade-
tolerant and is well suited for reforesting high brush-
risk areas near the coast.   
 
Age determination of western red-cedar is 
complicated by buttress formation and the associated 
complex growth patterns, but ring counts of trees 
from Washington and British Columbia indicate that 
some trees live at least up to 1460 years.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='In mixed-species and uneven-aged stands, western 
red cedars tolerate shady understory conditions and 
can maintain slow but acceptable growth rates over 
long periods.  In timber harvest of these mixed-
species stands, most of these trees are taken by 
clearcutting.  Because of steep terrain, decay, and 
breakage, harvesting costs are high and lumber 
recovery is low.  Because of its high susceptibility to 
 
 
 
windthrow in wet environments and in the moist sites 
where growth and yield are highest, western red 
cedars should not be left as scattered seed trees.  
Even those along clearcut margins may be lost to 
wind throw or exposure.   
Severe browse damage to western red-cedar 
seedlings and saplings by deer, elk, and rodents may 
be the most important problem in the establishment 
of young stands.  In near-coastal sites, western red-
cedar is more severely damaged by fire than any of 
its associates.

drink or boiled it into syrup.  They also ate young 
basswood leaves and used the cambium for soups and 
breads.  Various medicinal uses were made of leaf 
and bark extracts, and Iroquois used freshly cut bark 
as an emergency bandage for wounds.   
 
Wildlife: Basswood is good browse and buds are 
important for birds and deer in winter.  Fruits are 
eaten by birds and small mammals.  The wood 
decays easily and produces many cavities (especially 
in trees past 120 years of age), which are used by 
cavity-nesting animals (wood ducks, pileated 
woodpeckers, other birds, and small mammals).  
Basswood is a prolific nectar producer and 
pollination by honeybees results in a choice grade of 
honey.  
 
Restoration: Basswood is planted as a shade tree or 
ornamental. For sites of smaller size or with 
compacted soils, other Tilia species may be more 
suitable.  Basswood is said to be a soil-enriching 
species, bringing calcium and magnesium up from 
deep in the soil profile and depositing it in leaf litter 
on the surface.

The varieties of Tilia americana intergrade, but in 
their typical forms are separated as follows:   
 
a. Leaves green beneath, sometimes glaucous, 
glabrous or sparsely hairy with simple trichomes, 
sometimes with a few stellate ones.   var. americana

tomentum of dense, sessile-stellate trichomes, 
sometimes glabrate with age but remaining stellate-
pubescent at least along the major veins. (b)

clusters of hairs on leaves more than 0.5 mm wide.   
 
b. Young twigs glabrous. clusters of hairs on leaves

Distribution: Tilia americana is native to the 
Northern Deciduous and Great Lakes - St. Lawrence 
forest regions of North America.  It also extends into 
grassland areas along river courses in Manitoba and 
the mid-western United States, where it forms a 
component of riverine gallery forests.  In Canada, it 
is found from western New Brunswick into southern 
and central Québec and Ontario, extending as far 
west as north-western Ontario (along the U.S. border) 
and southern Manitoba.  In the United States, the 
species occurs as far south as the mountainous 
regions of North Carolina, Tennessee, and northern 
Arkansas.  The western limit for the species is south-
central Manitoba and North Dakota, and along the 
Niobrara River in north-central Nebraska.  For 
current distribution, please consult the Plant Profile

Seedlings can establish in as little as 25% of full

The typical life of a basswood is about 100 years but 
some are known to live 140-200 years.    
 
Basswood stump sprouts are often very common, and 
this may produce trees growing in close clusters.  
Stump sprouts arise from the main stem after its 
death, fire or logging injury, or aging, or even after 
disturbance of the surrounding stand.  Almost all 
basswoods 10 cm or less d.b.h. will sprout from the

Native Americans used fresh basswood sap, which 
contains moderate amounts of sugar, as a watery 
drink or boiled it into syrup.  They also ate young 
basswood leaves and used the cambium for soups and 
breads.  Various medicinal uses were made of leaf 
and bark extracts, and Iroquois used freshly cut bark 
as an emergency bandage for wounds.   
 
Wildlife: Basswood is good browse and buds are 
important for birds and deer in winter.  Fruits are 
eaten by birds and small mammals.  The wood 
decays easily and produces many cavities (especially 
in trees past 120 years of age), which are used by 
cavity-nesting animals (wood ducks, pileated 
woodpeckers, other birds, and small mammals).  
Basswood is a prolific nectar producer and 
pollination by honeybees results in a choice grade of 
honey.  
 
Restoration: Basswood is planted as a shade tree or 
ornamental. For sites of smaller size or with 
compacted soils, other Tilia species may be more 
suitable.  Basswood is said to be a soil-enriching 
species, bringing calcium and magnesium up from 
deep in the soil profile and depositing it in leaf litter 
on the surface.

Variation within the species:  
North American basswoods have been separated into 
many species (usually three or four) or treated as 
several varieties within only a single species.  “Given 
the inconstancy of most vegetative and reproductive 
characters [of North American basswood], the 
ecophenic, ecotypic, and seasonal variation in 
vestiture, and also the probability of introgression,” 
trichome morphology provides the best evidence for 
recognizing the component taxa (see Hardin 1990).

The varieties of Tilia americana intergrade, but in 
their typical forms are separated as follows:   
 
a. Leaves green beneath, sometimes glaucous, 
glabrous or sparsely hairy with simple trichomes, 
sometimes with a few stellate ones.   var. americana 
a. Leaves pale or whitish beneath from the close 
tomentum of dense, sessile-stellate trichomes, 
sometimes glabrate with age but remaining stellate-
pubescent at least along the major veins. (b)

clusters of hairs on leaves more than 0.5 mm wide.   
 
b. Young twigs glabrous. clusters of hairs on leaves 
less than 0.5 mm wide.   var. heterophylla 
 
Trees identified as Tilia neglecta may be variants of 
var. americana or they have been suggested to be 
introgressants between var. americana and var. 
heterophylla.  Tilia floridana is often recognized as 
separate entity.    
 
Distribution: Tilia americana is native to the 
Northern Deciduous and Great Lakes - St. Lawrence 
forest regions of North America.  It also extends into 
grassland areas along river courses in Manitoba and 
the mid-western United States, where it forms a 
component of riverine gallery forests.  In Canada, it 
is found from western New Brunswick into southern 
and central Québec and Ontario, extending as far 
west as north-western Ontario (along the U.S. border) 
and southern Manitoba.  In the United States, the 
species occurs as far south as the mountainous 
var. caroliniana 
 
 
regions of North Carolina, Tennessee, and northern 
Arkansas.  The western limit for the species is south-
central Manitoba and North Dakota, and along the 
Niobrara River in north-central Nebraska.  For 
current distribution, please consult the Plant Profile

Seedlings can establish in as little as 25% of full

The typical life of a basswood is about 100 years but 
some are known to live 140-200 years.    
 
Basswood stump sprouts are often very common, and 
this may produce trees growing in close clusters.  
Stump sprouts arise from the main stem after its 
death, fire or logging injury, or aging, or even after 
disturbance of the surrounding stand.  Almost all 
basswoods 10 cm or less d.b.h. will sprout from the

Basswood is most common in forests with long fire-
free intervals, because the thin bark and shallow roots 
are easily damaged by fire and basal fire wounds 
increase susceptibility to butt rot.  Prescribed fire is 
not recommended for established stands of 
hardwoods in which basswood occurs, as too-
frequent fire intervals eliminate basswood or restrict 
it to the most mesic sites.  In some places, however, 
these trees are encroaching onto former grasslands 
since fires have been suppressed.

increase susceptibility to butt rot.  Prescribed fire is 
not recommended for established stands of 
hardwoods in which basswood occurs, as too-
frequent fire intervals eliminate basswood or restrict 
it to the most mesic sites.  In some places, however, 
these trees are encroaching onto former grasslands 
since fires have been suppressed.

were used to lash together the poles that composed 
the framework of housing.  The dried fibers were 
used to remove scum in cooking.  The process used 
to strip off the outer coating is still used today.  It 
consists of placing bundles of the green moss into a 
shallow pond for six weeks, long enough for the 
outer coat to rot away.  Dry Spanish moss was used 
for fire arrows.  The moss was wrapped around the 
base of the shaft, lit on fire and then shot from the 
bow.  The moss was also an ingredient in the clay 
that was used to plaster the insides of houses.  Fresh 
Spanish moss was gathered, soaked in water and 
stuffed into dugout canoes to keep them from drying 
out and splitting.  The Natchez tribe of Louisiana 
played a game that used fist-size balls that were 
stuffed with Spanish moss.  The plant was boiled to 
make a tea for chills and fever.  There is evidence 
that Spanish moss was used over 3,000 years ago to 
make fire-tempered pottery.  Although the moss 
burned away during the firing, the distinctive pattern 
of the fibers is still evident in the clay pottery.  
Spanish moss is still used today by many Native 
American tribes.  For example, the Houma and the 
Koasati use Spanish moss in the construction and 
decoration of small dolls.   
 
Wildlife: Several species of bats including the 
Seminole bat roost in clumps of Spanish moss.  
Yellow-throated warblers and northern parulas build 
their nests inside clumps of living Spanish moss.  
Several other species of birds gather the moss for 
nesting material.  There is at least one species of 
spider that only occurs in Spanish moss.   
 
Livestock: The plant is used as fodder for animals.   
 
Other: Spanish moss is used in flower arrangements 
and as decorations for handicrafts.  It is said to be 
excellent mulch for the garden.  Spanish moss is 
grown commercially for use as packing material and 
as a replacement for horsehair in upholstery and 
mattress stuffing.  Campers, because of red bugs and 
chiggers do not recommend the plants for use as 
bedding.  If you wish to use fresh Spanish moss you 
may get rid of these pests by boiling small portions of 
the plant in water or heating them in the microwave.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Description='General: Pineapple Family (Bromeliaceae).  Spanish 
moss is a native, perennial epiphytic herb.  It is not 
Spanish, nor a moss, but a flowering plant.  The 
slender, wiry, long, branching stems (reaching 8m or 
more) grow as suspended, bluish-gray streamers and 
garlands draping among tree branches and sometimes 
telephone lines and fences.  The plant and is not 
parasitic, as is often thought, but attaches itself to 
trees for support.  The plant has no roots but derives 
its nutrients from rainfall, detritus and airborne dust.  
The stems and leaves are covered with overlapping 
silver-gray scales, which are important for absorbing 
water and trapping dust and nutrient particles.  It is 
thought that these plants may play a critical role in 
nutrient cycling.  The very narrow, linear, awl-shaped 
leaves (2.5 to 8 cm long) are whitish gray.  
Numerous, small, solitary blue or pale green flowers 
with three petals (6 to 8 mm long) grow in the axils 
of the leaves.  The flowers, which bloom for a period 
of three to four months from spring to fall, form 
interesting seeds (2.4 to 3 mm) with hairy sails that 
float on the wind and stick to tree branches.   
 
Distribution: Spanish moss is native to the 
Southeastern United States and Tropical America.  
For current distribution, please consult the Plant 
Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
site.   
 
Habitat: Spanish moss grows on trees in areas of high 
humidity.  It can be found on live oak and pines that 
border estuaries, rivers, swamps, and along the 
coastal plains of the Southeastern United States.

flowering-size corms, they can be directly planted 
outside.  Plant the corms in the fall in full sun.  The 
less crowded the more the corms will offset.  Plant 
them 2 to 4 inches apart and 4 inches deep.  A well-
drained soil that is light and loose will produce bigger 
corms.  Water and weed the patch regularly and 
protect it from small and large mammals, insects, and 
birds.  Keep the ground slightly damp.  If given too 
much water the corms will rot.  If it rains fairly 
regularly, don t water the area.  When the leaves on 
the plants have turned yellow and dried up, stop 
watering.  Allow the corms to summer bake.  The 
plants should be well established after one year.   
 
If planting seeds of white brodiaea, store the seeds in 
a paper bag until autumn.  Plant the seeds before 
October 1st in a container and care for them for two 
years before planting them outside in the ground.  
Plant the seeds in six-inch (or bigger) pots because 
the corms will pull themselves down to the depth 
they require.  Plant about 100 seeds per pot.  Place 
them on top of the soil and sprinkle a little soil over 
them and put one-quarter inch gravel on top.  Set the 
pots in partial shade so they won t dry out so fast.  
They can be outside or in a hot house.  The seed does 
not need to be stratified.  Start watering the pots right 
away and keep them slightly damp.  Fertilize the pots 
in late winter and early spring and protect the plants 
from birds and other animals.  If the pots are outside, 
let the rains naturally water the pots and in a drought 
year, supplement with hand watering.  Stop watering 
as soon as the foliage of the plants turns yellow.

plants and transplant them two inches apart in the fall 
when the corms are dormant.  Then water them.  
Grow them for one more year or two more years to 
bloom, repeating this cycle and then plant them 
outside in the ground in the autumn. 
Management 
The area of white brodiaea will require regular 
weeding and the use of a very weak solution of 
fertilizer twice only during the active growth in the 
spring.  The corms can be kept from overcrowding by 
thinning them every three years.  This involves 
picking off the cormlets and replanting them 
elsewhere in the garden.   
 
There are five major types of indigenous 
management activities conducted in California that 
were designed to ensure future corm production at 
traditional gathering sites: 1) conscious breaking off 
cormlets from the harvested parent corms and 
replanting them. 2) sparing whole plants. 3) 
harvesting the corms after plants have gone to seed 
and dumping the seeds on the ground. 4) burning 
areas. and 5) irrigation.  Periodic digging and 
thinning of the corms, and popping off the cormlets 
and replanting them may enhance grass nut numbers 
and densities.  Digging corms may in fact be a form 
of tillage, which will increase the size of the 
gathering tract, aerate the soil, lower weed 
competition, and prepare the seedbed to increase seed 
germination rates.  If grass nut populations require 
periodic disturbance to maintain and increase their 
populations, then indigenous harvesting regimes if 
reenacted, may help maintain populations.  
Populations becoming overcrowded or showing 
reduced vigor should be thinned.

There are five major types of indigenous 
management activities conducted in California that 
were designed to ensure future corm production at 
traditional gathering sites: 1) conscious breaking off 
cormlets from the harvested parent corms and 
replanting them. 2) sparing whole plants. 3) 
harvesting the corms after plants have gone to seed 
and dumping the seeds on the ground. 4) burning 
areas. and 5) irrigation.  Periodic digging and 
thinning of the corms, and popping off the cormlets 
and replanting them may enhance grass nut numbers 
and densities.  Digging corms may in fact be a form 
of tillage, which will increase the size of the 
gathering tract, aerate the soil, lower weed 
competition, and prepare the seedbed to increase seed 
germination rates. If grass nut populations require 
periodic disturbance to maintain and increase their 
populations, then indigenous harvesting regimes if 
reenacted, may help maintain populations.  At the

to treat inflammation of the throat.  The steam from 
hot infusions was sniffed into the nasal passages to 
treat colds, coughs, headaches, and nose bleeds.  
Sitting over a steaming decoction of the leaves 
treated uterine trouble.   
 
The raw or boiled leaves were crushed into a poultice 
to treat wounds.  Ground leaves were rubbed on the 
face and chest of persons with colds or any place on 
the skin where there was pain (Bocek 1984).  Leaf 
decoctions were applied to infected sores, smallpox 
lesions, and other skin eruptions.  Vinegarweed was 
steeped in water and used as a bath to prevent 
smallpox and ague.  Chewed leaves were stuffed in 
or around an aching tooth.   
 
The Kawaiisu tribe made a nonmedicinal drink from 
the leaves (Zigmond 1981).  The aromatic leaves and 
stems were crushed and placed in bedding to repel 
fleas.   
 
The Salinan was among those California tribes that 
used vinegarweed to aid in catching fish.  The 
fisherman would strategically build dams in rivers 
and streams to trap the fish within small ponds.  
Then, mashed or powdered plants were thrown into 
the water with the fish.  After the plants were added, 
the fish would become sluggish and easier to catch in 
the fishermen’s nets or sieves made of willow.  
Numerous reasons have been offered for this reaction 
including that the fish were either poisoned 
(Moerman 1998), their gills clogged (Murphey 
1959), or that the plants affected the oxygen in the 
water (Heinzen 1972).

The plants range from 1 to 10 dm with branches 
arising from the base.  The thin, lance-shaped leaves 
are 2 to 7 cm long.  The leaves are dotted with glands 
that produce the strong somewhat sour odor.  The 
pale blue to lavender flowers grow from the leaf axils 
along one side of the top of the unbranched stems.  
The flowers are slender tubes, 5 to 10 mm long, with 
five lobes and long arched stamens (13 to 20 mm) 
that protrude out of the flower.  The seeds are four 
tiny nutlets that are joined at the base.  The seeds 
germinate with the rains, but begin to grow in earnest 
only after the rainy season has ended.  The plants 
bloom from late June or July until November.   
 
Distribution: Vinegarweed occurs from northern 
Oregon to the northern Baja along the Pacific Coast 
Ranges.  It grows in dry, open fields and roadsides 
below 1000 meters.  For current distribution, please 
consult the Plant Profile page for this species on the

The Salinan and other California tribes used the 
closely related perennial shrub, Trichostema lanatum 
(wooly blue curls or California rosemary) for many 
of the same purposes as vinegarweed.  T. lanatum 
resembles rosemary (Rosmarinus spp.) and is a 
 
 
lovely addition to the garden.  There are two cultivars 
of T. lanatum (“Lion Den” and Salmon Creek”) that 
have been developed by the UC Santa Cruz 
Arboretum (Rogers 2001).  Both cultivars are from 
cuttings taken in the Santa Lucia Mountains.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Description='General: Spiderwort Family (Commelinaceae).  
Virginia spiderwort is a native, perennial forb.  This 
plant was probably named for the delicate spider 
web-like filaments that surround the anthers of the 
flower or the threadlike secretion that emerges from 
the stem upon cutting.  The lightly fragrant flowers (2 
to 5.4 cm in diameter) grow in terminal clusters.  The 
flower’s three broadly ovate petals are generally 
bright blue but are sometimes purple, violet, rose, and 
rarely white.  Individual blossoms last for only one or 
two days, but new blossoms appear daily throughout 
the spring blooming period.  The plants grow in erect 
clumps that range from 30 to 60 cm in height.  The 
rounded stalks are either single or branched at the 
base.  The roots are thick and fleshy.  The plant 
spreads through underground stems or stolons to 
form large colonies.  The smooth iris-like leaves are 
long (15 to 46 cm) and narrow (2.5 cm wide) with a 
prominent midrib.   
 
Distribution: For current distribution, please consult 
the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site.   
 
Habitat: Virginia spiderwort can be found in moist 
prairies, fertile woodlands, open woods, meadows, 
hillsides, stony bluffs, stream banks, and along 
roadsides.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Virginia spiderwort is a vigorous plant that likes 
moist soils but will adapt to drier, average garden 
soils.  The plants are often seen in old-fashioned 
gardens and work well as part of a perennial border.  
They are recommended for bogs and naturally wet 
sites where the plants can form large clumps when 
grown in full sun.  The plants will flower in both sun 
and shade.  Plants may be propagated from seed but 
they are more easily started from cuttings or 
divisions.  For cuttings, take a single-node stem 
cutting late in the season, just as the plants begin to 
bolt.  Place the cutting in moist soil up to the base of 
the leaf.  To propagate by division, divide the thick 
roots in the fall or early in the spring.  Be careful to 
divide the leaves so that each section includes its own 
roots.  Established plants will self-sow and stalks that 
lay on the ground will readily root from the nodes.

food and medicinal purposes.  The young leaves were 
eaten as salad greens or were mixed with other greens 
and then either fried or boiled until tender.  The plant 
was mashed and rubbed onto insect bites to relieve 
pain and itching.  A paste, made from the mashed 
roots, was used as a poultice to treat cancer.  A tea 
made from the plant was used as a laxative and to 
treat stomachaches associated with overeating.  
Virginia spiderwort was one of the seven ingredients 
in a tea used to treat “female ailments or rupture.”  It 
was also combined with several other ingredients in a 
medicine for kidney trouble.

the plant.  The plants will flower a second time in the 
late summer or fall if the stems are removed soon 
after the first flowering period.  This vigorous grower 
can be somewhat controlled by dividing the plants 
every two to four years and by regularly removing 
the stalks that slump to the ground before they have 
the opportunity to take root.  Large clumps may be 
divided by first lifting the root mass from the soil 
with a shovel.  Then divide the clump into pieces that 
contain four to six shoots each with roots attached.  
Immediately plant and water the divisions.

and geese are known to be fond of the rhizomes, 
which were sometimes used as bait for hunting these 
birds.  Wild animals, like domestic livestock, relish 
the foliage of clovers.  The small, hard seeds of 
western clovers are important to quail, but other 
upland game birds limit their use of clovers almost 
entirely to the foliage.  Small quantities of clover 
seeds are eaten by many species of songbirds.

perennial herbs that have palmately compound, bright 
green leaves with three leaflets (trifoliate).  All 
species have the distinctive, round flower heads 
composed of many, small, pea-like flowers.  
Springbank clover is a native coastal herbaceous 
perennial often growing in dense patches from long, 
slender white rhizomes, with fibrous roots arising 
from their nodes.  The stems, up to 80 cm, are erect 
to creeping.  The reddish purple or magenta flowers 
are usually white-tipped, 12-16 mm long, with 2-5 
flowers per stalk.  The flower heads are 2-3 cm in 
diameter, and are held in a saucer-shaped involuvre 
with 8-12 bracts.  The fruits are tiny pea-like pods 
containing 2-6 seeds. 
 
Distribution: For current distribution, please consult 
the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site.  It is found from British 
Columbia, north as far as the Queen Charlotte Islands 
(possibly to the southern Alaska panhandle), south to 
California and Mexico, and east to the Rocky 
Mountains. 
 
Habitat: Springbank clover is found in wet and 
periodically inundated places, such as high salt and 
brackish marshes, coastal dunes, wet meadows, and 
stream banks.  It is commonly associated with Pacific 
silverweed.  It occurs from beaches to mountain 
meadows, ridges, generally open, moist, or marchy 
places as elevations below 3200 m.

long, brown roots of Pacific silverweed (Potentilla 
anserinas ssp. pacifica).  Both plants were usually 
dug in the fall, after the leaves had started to die back 
for the winter.  The rhizomes were pried out with 
long, pointed wooden digging sticks.  They were 
cleaned and tied in fist-sized bundles using one of the 
rhizomes as a tie.  Occasionally, they were eaten raw, 
but typically, they were cooked in an underground 
pit.  The rhizomes were often dried for winter use.

In greenhouse conditions, it is best to dig up and 
separate plants in the late fall or winter.  This is 
the “quiescent” period that follows seed 
maturation and leaves are senescent. 
Split the plant clump into pieces by hand, then 
cut the rhizomes into sections, each with one or 
more buds. 
For dividing the whole plant, gently loosen the 
soil around the plant, taking care to not damage 
the roots, then lift the plant gently with a 
pitchfork.  Shake off as much soil from the roots, 
as possible. 
-  Divide the plant into smaller pieces by hand, 
retaining only healthy, vigorous sections, each 
with new shoots and rhizome buds. 
-  Replant the divisions as soon as possible.  It is 
important that the plants don’t dry out, so if 
replanting is delayed a couple of hours, dip the 
plants briefly in water and keep them in a sealed 
plastic bag in a cool, shady place until you are 
ready to plant them. 
-  Cut back the old top-growth and replant the 
divided plant sections to the same depth as 
before.

thoroughly, taking care not to expose the roots 
by washing away soil. 
Springbank clover plants should be planted in 
the full sun in a light, loose soil.  Plants should 
be planted on 12-18” centers.  They will fill in 
and make solid stands of clover in one year. 
Plants need to be kept moist and need frequent 
watering.  Lightly fertilize the plants during the 
growing season. 
Springbank clover tolerates brackish conditions, 
so it can be used to restore salt marshes and 
wetlands. 
Plants may need to be protected from herbivores, 
such as rabbits or gophers. 
-  Wild harvesting should be restricted to salvage 
sites with appropriate approvals or permits.  Due 
to the loss of wetland and salt marsh habitat 
throughout the U.S., it is rarely appropriate to 
harvest witl plants.

to its full shade tolerance), although as a hedge it 
must be repeatedly pruned to keep it in size.  It has a 
naturally open growth habit – if bought with a dense 
canopy effect, it may have been repeatedly sheared at 
the nursery (or Christmas tree farm).    
 
Numerous cultivars of eastern hemlock have been 
developed, including compact shrubs, dwarfs, form 
mutants (weeping, fastigiate, prostrate, etc.), color 
mutants (variegated), and graceful trees.  The wild 
type apparently also is common in cultivation.  
Eastern hemlock stands are considered important as 
shelter and cover for white-tailed deer and other 
wildlife species, such as turkey, ruffed grouse, and 
others.

Seed cones ovoid, 1.5-2.5 cm long, borne near the 
branch tips, hanging.  The common name pertains to 
its distribution in eastern North America.    
 
Variation within the species: various studies have 
recorded physiological and morphological variation 
within the species, but no major discontinuities have 
been found to suggest that named entities should be 
recognized.   
 
The geographic distribution of eastern hemlock 
completely overlaps that of Carolina hemlock (Tsuga 
caroliniana), which differs in its high elevation 
habitats, leaves mostly spreading all directions from 
the twigs, and more elongate seed cones.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Uses TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Uses='Industry: Eastern hemlock was early valued for its 
bark, an important source of tannin for the leather 
industry.  Trees were felled and stripped of their bark, 
which was then milled for tannin extraction.  To 
simplify stripping the bark and turning the logs, trees 
were often felled into lakes.  Many of these logs were 
much later extracted from northern lakes and milled.     
 
The wood has been used for light framing, roofing, 
boxes and crates, and pulping, but it tends to be 
brittle and eastern hemlock is not presently important 
as a timber tree.  Commercial stands have been 
greatly reduced by prior harvesting and lack of 
restocking.   
 
Ethnobotanic: American Indians used the cambium 
as the base for breads and soups or mixed it with 
dried fruit and animal fat for pemmican.  Natives and 
white settlers also made tea from hemlock leaves, 
which have a high vitamin C content.   
 
Conservation: Eastern hemlock can be used as a 
specimen, screen, or group planting, and it can be 
sheared over time into a formal evergreen hedge,

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Adaptation TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Adaptation='Eastern hemlock grows from about sea level to 1500 
meters.  In the more southern parts of its range, 
eastern hemlock occurs only where there is drainage 
of cool, moist air -- on moist rocky ridges, valleys 
and ravines, hillsides, and lakeshores.  In the northern 
hardwood forest, it is found on a greater variety of 
sites, including low rolling hills and glacial ridges.  
Eastern hemlock most commonly grows in mixed 
stands with species such as white pine, northern red 
oak, sugar maple, American beech, yellow birch, and 
white ash.   
 
' WHERE symbol='tsca';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Eastern hemlocks begin to produce cones at about 
age 15 in vigorous trees or much later in suppressed 
trees.  There is a high frequency of cone crops and 
individual trees have a long duration of cone 
production (excellent cone production has been 
reported for trees more than 450 years old), but the 
viability of seed usually is low.  Seeds are 
particularly easily damaged by drying.  The best 
conditions for germination and seedling 
establishment are under a 70-80% crown cover on an 
exposed, partially decomposed layer.  Otherwise, 
regeneration is restricted to rotten logs, stumps, and 
mounds that normally have warmer surfaces and 
better moister retention than the forest floor.     
 
Eastern hemlock is the most shade tolerant of all tree 
species and individuals may remain in the understory 
in natural stands for 25-400 years.  After a plant 
reaches 1-2 meters in height, the root system has 
reached a depth not radically afffected by surface 
drying, and release from overstory competition may 
greatly increase annual growth.  In general, eastern 
hemlock is a slow-growing tree that may take 250 to 
300 years to reach maturity and may live for 900 
years or more.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='Eastern hemlock generally does not tolerate nutrient-
poor soils, wet soils or poorly drained sites, 
prolonged drought, prolonged heat, sun scorch, 
windy and exposed sites, aerial pollution, or winter 
salt spray.  Drought is probably the most serious 
 
 
damaging agent to the species, especially during the 
seedling stage.  Damping-off fungi and root rots also 
are seriously damaging to young plants.  
Containerized plants are best for transplanting – 
move into sites that are cool, well-drained, and wind-
protected, in partial sun to partial shade.  Good 
drainage is essential for transplant success -- the 
porosity of the soil should be improved with peat 
moss or sand, with the root ball elevated about 2&quot. to 
4&quot. above the surrounding soil grade.   
 
A shallow root system makes trees highly susceptible 
to wind-throw when exposed through timber cutting 
or planted in open sites.  Plants should be staked for 
the first two or three years following transplant, to 
prevent wind-throw.  Saplings and small trees are 
highly susceptible to damage from fire because of the 
thin bark, and root injury often occurs from high 
intensity fires because of heavy litter concentration.   
 
The most severe insect pest is the Asian hemlock 
woolly adelgid, a phloem-feeding insect that causes 
branch dieback and tree decline.  Trees typically die 
after several years of adelgid infestation.

Medicinal: Western hemlock was commonly 
employed medicinally by several native North 
American Indian tribes who used it to treat a variety 
of complaints (Moerman 1998).  Hemlock pitch was 
applied for a variety of purposes, including poultices 
or poultice coverings, linaments rubbed on the chest 
for colds and when mixed with deer tallow as a salve 
to prevent sunburn (Pojar &amp. MacKinnon 1994).  A 
decoction of the pounded bark has been used in the 
treatment of hemorrhages, diaphoretic, and diuretic 
(Moerman 1998).  The powdered bark can be put in 
shoes for foot odor. 
 
Landscaping &amp. Wildlife: Tsuga heterophylla is 
occasionally planted as an ornamental tree in 
northern states and in Western Europe (Sargent 
1961).  Western hemlock stands provide cover and 
habitat for many wildlife species and small 
mammals.  It is also used for nest trees by cavity 
nesting birds.  This species is browsed by elk and 
deer.  The seedlings are eaten by snowshoe hares and 
rabbits. 
 
Agroforestry: Western hemlock is used in forested 
riparian buffers to help reduce stream bank erosion, 
protect aquatic environments, enhance wildlife, and 
increase biodiversity.  
 
Economic: It is one of the best pulpwood for paper 
and paperboard products.  The wood is used in house 
construction for external walls, structural support and 
is suited for interior finish, kitchen cabinets, flooring, 
and ceiling.

Distribution: Western hemlock is native in 
northwestern California, Oregon, Washington, British 
Columbia, Alaska, Idaho, and Montana (McMinn &amp. 
Maino 1963).  In California, western hemlock occurs 
near the coast in scattered localities from Del Norte 
County southward to the vicinity of Elk Creek, 
Mendocino County (Ibid.).  In Oregon and

(Pojar &amp. MacKinnon 1994).  This species is very 
shade tolerant and thrives in full sun and regenerates 
well under a closed canopy.  Western hemlock grows 
in pure stands or mixed at lower levels with Douglas-
fir, silver and grand firs, giant arborvitae, redwood, 
and hardwood and at higher elevations with noble fir, 
Alaska cedar, mountain hemlock, western, white, and 
lodgepole pines (Preston 1989).

are edible when 
gathered at the 
appropriate stage of 
growth.  The young 
shoots are cut from the rhizomes (underground 
stems) in the spring when they are about 4 to 16 
inches long.  The base of the stem where it attaches 
to the rhizome can be boiled or roasted like potatoes.  
The young flower stalks can be taken out of their 
sheaths and can be boiled or steamed just like corn.  
Cattail pollen is a fine substitute for flours.  It is a 
bright yellow or green color, and turns pancakes, 
cookies or biscuits a pretty yellow color (which 
children love).  The rhizomes and lower stems have a 
sweet flavor and can be eaten raw, baked, roasted, or 
broiled.  Cattail rhizomes are fairly high in starch 
content. this is usually listed at about 30% to 46%.  
The core can be ground into flour.  One acre of 
cattails would yield about 6,475 pounds of flour 
(Harrington 1972).  This flour would probably

is a potential source of food for the worlds  
population. 
 
The Klamath and Modoc peoples of northern 
California and southern Oregon made flexible 
baskets of twined cattail.  Cattails were also twined to 
form mats of varying sizes for sleeping, sitting, 
working, entertaining, covering doorways, providing 
shade, and a myriad of other uses.  Lengths of cattail 
were plied into rope or other size cordage, and cattail 
rope was used in some areas to bind bundles of tule 
into tule boats.  Air pockets or aerenchyma in the 
stems provided the buoyancy for good boat-building 
material. 
 
The Cahuilla Indians used the stalks for matting, 
bedding material, and ceremonial bundles (Barrows 
1967).  Some tribes used the leaves and sheath bases 
as caulking materials.  Apaches used the pollen in 
female puberty ceremonies.  After dipping the spike 
in coal oil, the stalk makes a fine torch.  The fluff can 
also be used as tinder, insulation, or for lining baby 
cradleboards.  The down is used for baby beds 
(Murphey 1959). 
 
Wildlife: The multitudes of tiny, wind-carried seeds 
are too small and too hairy to be attractive to birds 
(Hotchkiss and Dozier 1949).  In a few exceptions, 
the seeds are eaten by several duck species.  Cattail 
rootstocks are much more valuable as food for 
wildlife than are the seeds.  Geese and muskrats 
prefer the stems and roots.  Moose and elk eat fresh 
spring shoots.  Shelter and nesting cover are provided 
for long-billed marsh wrens, redwing blackbirds, and 
yellow-headed blackbirds. 
 
Conservation: This plant is used widely for wetland 
restoration and constructed wetlands for tertiary 
water treatment.  Typha species can become invasive 
in disturbed habitats.

The spike-like, terminal, cylindric inflorescence has 
staminate flowers above and pistillate flowers below.  
The naked axis between the staminate and pistillate 
flowers is generally 1-8 cm.  The spike is medium to 
dark brown.  The basal leaves are thin with parallel 
veins running their long, narrow length.  The leaves 
are 4-12 mm wide when fresh, 3-8 mm wide when 
dry. 
 
Typha angustifolia generally occurs in deeper water 
than Typha latifolia.  Typha angustifolia has fewer 
and larger rhizomes, resulting in a low rate of cloning 
but enabling it to grow in deeper water than Typha 
latifolia.  Typha angustifolia has a higher allocation 
to sexual reproduction.  Cattails spread both 
vegetatively and by seed, particularly under 
drawdown conditions.

•  Seeds can be harvested when they are slightly 
immature.  It is important to harvest the 
staminate stalks before they dry and blow away.  
•  Harvest by using either hand clippers, cutting the 
stem off below the seed heads, or by stripping 
the seed heads off of the stalk.  Use a seed 
cleaner to process the seeds.  Dry and store the 
seeds in brown paper or burlap bags. 
 
 
•  Plant cleaned seed in fall.  Plant in clean, weed-
free, moist seedbed.  Flooded or ponded soils 
will significantly increase seedling mortality. 
•  Broadcast seed and roll in or rake 1/4&quot. to 1/2&quot. 
from the soil surface.  Some seed may be lost 
due to scour or flooding.  Recommended seed 
density is unknown at this time. 
 
Seed Germination in Greenhouse 
•  Plant in the greenhouse in 1&quot. x 1&quot. x 2&quot. pots, 1/4&quot. 
under the soil surface.  Keep soil surface moist.  
Greenhouse temperature should be 100° F (plus 
or minus 5° F).  Seeds will begin to germinate 
after a couple weeks in warm temperatures.   
•  Plants will be ready in 100-120 days to come out 
as plugs.  By planting seeds in August, plugs are 
ready to plant in the soil by November.  These 
plants are very small.  Growing plants to a larger 
size will result in increased revegetation success.

removed from a 0.4 m² (4 ft²) area, the plants 
will grow back into the hole in one good 
growing season.  A depth of 15 cm (6 in) is 
sufficient for digging plugs.  This will leave 
enough plants and rhizomes to grow back during 
the growing season.  
•  Donor plants that are drought-stressed tend to 
have higher revegetation success. 
•  Live transplants should be planted in moist (not 
flooded or anoxic) soils as soon as possible.  
Plants should be transported and stored in a cool 
location prior to planting.  Plugs may be split 
into smaller units, generally no smaller than 6 x 
6 cm (2.4 x 2.4 in), with healthy rhizomes and 
tops.  The important factor in live plant 
collections is to be sure to include a growing bud 
in either plugs or rhizomes.  Weeds in the plugs 
should be removed by hand.  For ease in 
transport, soil may be washed gently from roots.  
The roots should always remain moist or in 
water until planted.  
•  Clip leaves and stem from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10

' WHERE symbol='tyan';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='Heavy grazing will eliminate Typha species, as well 
as other native species, from riparian corridors.  
However, cattails are fairly resistant to moderate 
grazing, providing wet soils are not compacted. 
 
Because cattails have relatively little value for ducks, 
they are often regarded as undesirable weeds in 
places intended primarily for ducks.  It has been 
found that mowing cattails after the heads are well–
formed, but not mature, then following up with 
another mowing about a month later (when new 
growth is two or three feet high) will kill at least 75% 
of the plants.  This will enable other emergent 
vegetation with more palatable and nutritious seeds to 
become established. 
 
Environmental Concerns: Ecologically, cattails tend 
to invade native plant communities when hydrology, 
salinity, or fertility change.  In this case, they out-
compete native species, often becoming monotypic 
stands of dense cattails.  Maintaining water flows into 
the wetland, reducing nutrient input, and maintaining 
salinity in tidal marshes will help maintain desirable 
species composition.  If cattails begin to invade, 
physical removal may be necessary. 
 
Over the past century, we have dramatically 
increased the range of this species and have brought 
T. angustifolia and T. latifolia together with the 
production of the hybrid T. glauca.  This taxon is 
extremely aggressive and will out-compete either 
parent.  The methods of control include clipping and 
floocing &gt.12 inches, herbicides, and hydrology 
management (Melvin 2000).  Please contact your 
local agricultural extension specialist or county weed 
specialist to learn what works best in your area and 
how to use it safely.  Always read label and safety

The young flower stalks can be taken out of their 
sheaths and can be boiled or steamed just like corn.  
Cattail pollen is a fine substitute for flours. it is a 
bright yellow or green color, and turns pancakes, 
cookies or biscuits a pretty yellow color (which 
children love).  The rhizomes (underground stems) 
and lower stems have a sweet flavor and can be eaten 
raw, baked, roasted, or broiled.  Cattail rhizomes are 
fairly high in starch content. this is usually listed at 
about 30% to 46%.  The core can be ground into 
flour.  One acre of cattails would yield about 6,475 
pounds of flour (Harrington 1972).  This flour would 
probably contain about 80 % carbohydrates and 
around 6% to 8% protein.  Since cattail occurs 
around the world, it is a potential source of food for 
the worlds  population. 
 
The Cahuilla Indians used the stalks for matting, 
bedding material, and ceremonial bundles (Barrows 
1967).  Some tribes used the leaves and sheath bases 
as caulking materials.  Apaches used the pollen in 
female puberty ceremonies.  After dipping the spike 
in coal oil, the stalk makes a fine torch.  The fluff can 
also be used as tinder, insulation, or for lining baby 
cradle boards.  The down is used for baby beds 
(Murphy 1959). 
 
Lengths of cattail were plied into rope or other size 
cordage, and cattail rope was used in some areas to 
bind bundles of tule into tule boats.  Air pockets or 
aerenchyma in the stems provide the buoyancy that 
makes tule good boat-building material.  
 
Other Uses: Wildlife, wetland restoration, wastewater 
tertiary treatment, edible (young shoots, base of stem, 
flower stalks, pollen, rhizomes), baskets, matting, 
bedding material, ceremonial bundles, caulking 
material, and cordage.  The multitudes of tiny, wind-
carried seeds are too small and too hairy to be 
attractive to birds (Hotchkiss and Dozier 1949).  In a 
few exceptions, the seeds are eaten by several duck 
species.  Cattail rootstocks are much more valuable

Live Plant Collections: No more than ¼ of the plants

Live transplants should be planted in moist (not

inches long.  The raw young shoots taste like 
cucumber and can also be made into pickles.  When 
the young shoots are steamed they taste like cabbage.  
The base of the stem where it attaches to the rhizome 
can be boiled or roasted like potatoes.  The young 
flower stalks can be taken out of their sheaths and 
can be boiled or steamed just like corn (Roos-Collins 
1990. Clarke 1977).   
 
Cattail pollen is a fine substitute for flours.  It is a 
bright yellow or green color, and turns pancakes, 
cookies or biscuits a pretty yellow color (which 
children love).  The rhizomes (underground stems) 
and lower stems have a sweet flavor and can be eaten 
raw, baked, roasted, or broiled.  Cattail rhizomes are 
fairly high in starch content. this is usually listed at 
about 30% to 46%.  The core can be ground into 
flour.  One acre of cattails would yield about 6,475 
pounds of flour (Harrington 1972).  This flour would 
probably contain about 80 % carbohydrates and 
around 6% to 8% protein.  Since cattail occurs 
around the world, it is a potential source of food for 
the worlds  population. 
 
Newly emerging shoots of cattails are edible, with 
delicate flavor and crispy asparagus like texture 
(Glenn Keator, Linda Yamane, Ann Lewis 1995).  
The end of a new stem of cattail is popular for eating 
with Washoes (Murphy 1959).  When mixed with 
tallow, the brown fuzz can be chewed like gum. 
 
The Klamath and Modocs of northern California and 
southern Oregon make flexible baskets of twined tule 
or cattail.  Cattails or tules were also twined to form 
mats of varying sizes for sleeping, sitting, working, 
entertaining, covering doorways, for shade, and a 
myriad of other uses. 
 
The Cahuilla Indians used the stalks for matting, 
bedding material, and ceremonial bundles (Barrows 
1967).  Some tribes used the leaves and sheath bases 
as caulking materials.  Apaches used the pollen in 
female puberty ceremonies.  After dipping the spike 
in coal oil, the stalk makes a fine torch.  The fluff can 
also be used as tinder, insulation, or for lining baby 
cradleboards.  The down is used for baby beds 
(Murphey 1959). 
 
Lengths of cattail were plied into rope or other size 
cordage, and cattail rope was used in some areas to 
bind bundles of tule into tule boats.  Air pockets or

Other Uses: Wildlife, wetland restoration, wastewater 
tertiary treatment, edible (young shoots, base of stem, 
flower stalks, pollen, rhizomes), and aesthetics.  The 
multitudes of tiny, wind-carried seeds are too small 
and too hairy to be attractive to birds (Hotchkiss and 
Dozier 1949).  In a few exceptions, the seeds are 
eaten by several duck species.  Cattail rootstocks are 
much more valuable as food for wildlife than are the 
seeds.  Geese and muskrats prefer the stems and 
roots.  Moose and elk eat fresh spring shoots.  Shelter 
and nesting cover are provided for long-billed marsh 
wrens, red-wing blackbirds, and yellow-headed 
blackbirds.

herbaceous, rhizomatous perennial plants with long, 
slender green stalks topped with brown, fluffy, 
sausage-shaped flowering heads.  Typha latifolia 
plants are 15-30 dm tall.  The spike-like, terminal, 
cylindric inflorescence has staminate flowers above 
and pistillate flowers below with a naked axis 
between the staminate and pistillate flowers.  The 
spike is green when fresh, becoming brown as it 
matures.  The basal leaves are thin with parallel veins 
running the long, narrow length of the leaf.  These 
plants are rhizomatous and colonial.

Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
site.  Broad-leaved cattails are common throughout 
the United States and temperate and tropical places 
worldwide (Hickman 1993).  Typha latifolia occurs 
in coastal and valley marshes at elevations lower than 
2,000 m. 
 
' WHERE symbol='tyla';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Establishment='Adaptation: Typha latifolia generally occurs in 
shallower water than Typha angustifolia.  Compared 
to T. angustifolia, T. latifolia is exploitative in its 
ability to clone rapidly and produce a large leaf 
surface area, which may contribute to its superior 
competitive ability (Grace and Wetzel 1982).  Typha 
latifolia has been found to be tolerant of water level 
fluctuations and moderate soil salinity.  Cattail 
 
 
spreads both vegetatively and by seed, particularly 
under drawdown (Shay et al. 1986). 
 
Cattails are always found in or near water, in 
marshes, ponds, lakes and depressions.  They are 
obligate wetland indicator plant species.  Cattails 
tolerate perennial flooding, reduced soil conditions 
and moderate salinity.  With influxes of nutrient or 
freshwater, cattails are aggressive invaders in both 
brackish salt marshes and freshwater wetlands.  
' WHERE symbol='tyla';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_ TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_='Cattails, like many emergent wetland species, tolerate 
flood drawdown cycles that occur to varying degrees 
in different wetland and riparian systems.  Flood and 
drought are disturbance factors that vary in 
frequency, magnitude, and predictability.  Frequency 
relates to the number of episodes per unit time while 
magnitude of flooding can be expressed in terms of 
water volume, velocity, gradient, depth, duration, and 
season of inundation.  When planting cattails, the 
flood-draw-down cycles must be taken into 
consideration for successful revegetation. 
 
Planting: Typha species may be planted from bare 
rootstock or seedlings from container stalk or directly 
seeded into the soil.  Bare rootstock or seedlings are 
preferred revegetation methods where there is 
moving water.  Typha seeds germinate readily and 
are a cost-effective means to propagate cattail on 
moist soils.  To ensure a long-term stable ecosystem, 
it is recommended that Typha be just one of the 
species in the mix for wetland restoration. 
 
Seed Collections: Select seed collection sites where 
continuous stands with few intermixed species can 
easily be found.  At each collection location, obtain 
permission for seed collection. 
•  Seed is harvested by either taking hand clippers 
and cutting the stem off below the seed heads or 
stripping the seed heads off the stalk. 
•  Collect and store seeds in brown paper bags or 
burlap bags.  Seeds are then dried in these bags. 
•  Seeds can be harvested when they are slightly 
immature.  It is important to harvest the 
staminate stalks before they dry and blow away.  
•  Seeds and seed heads need to be cleaned in a 
seed cleaner.  Plant cleaned seed in fall.  
•  Plant in clean, weed - free, moist seed bed.  
Flooded or ponded soils will significantly 
increase seedling mortality. 
•  Broadcast seed and roll in or rake 1/4&quot. to 1/2&quot. 
from the soil surface. 
•  Some seed may be lost due to scour or flooding.  
Recommended seed density is unknown at this 
time.

Seed germination in greenhouse: Clean seed - blow 
out light seed. 
•  To grow seeds, plant in greenhouse in 1&quot. x 1&quot. x 
2&quot. pots, 1/4&quot. under the soil surface.  Keep soil 
surface moist.  Greenhouse temperature should 
be 100 degrees F (plus or minus 5 degrees).  
Seeds begin to germinate after a couple weeks in 
warm temperatures.   
•  Plants are ready in 100 - 120 days to come out as 
plugs.  By planting seeds in August, plugs are 
ready to plant in soil by November.  These plants 
are very small. growing plants to a larger size 
will result in increased revegetation success.  
 
Live Plant Collections: No more than 1/4 of the 
plants in an area should be collected.  If no more than 
0.09 m2 (1 ft2) should be removed from a 0.4 m2 (4 
ft2) area, the plants will grow back in the hole in one 
good growing season.  A depth of 15 cm (6 in) is 
sufficiently deep for digging plugs.  This will leave 
enough plants and rhizomes to grow back during the 
growing season.  Donor plants, which are drought-
stressed, tend to have higher revegetation success. 
 
Live transplants should be planted in moist (not 
flooded or anoxic) soils as soon as possible.  Plants 
should be transported and stored in a cool location 
prior to planting.  Plugs may be split into smaller 
units, generally no smaller than 6 x 6 cm (2.4 x 2.4 
in), with healthy rhizomes and tops.  The important 
factor in live plant collections is to be sure to include 
a growing bud in either plugs or rhizomes.  Weeds in 
the plugs should be removed by hand.  For ease in 
transport, soil may be washed gently from roots.  The 
roots should always remain moist or in water until 
planted.  
 
Clip leaves and stems from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in). 
this allows the plant to allocate more energy into root 
production.  Plant approximately 1 meter apart.  
Plants should be planted closer together if the site has 
fine soils such as clay or silt, steep slopes, or 
prolonged inundation. 
 
Ideally, plants should be planted in moist soils in late 
fall just after the first rains (usually late October to 
November).  This enables plant root systems to 
become established before heavy flooding and winter 
dormancy occurs.  Survival is highest when plants are 
dormant and soils are moist.  Fertilization is very 
helpful for plant growth and reproduction.  Many 
more seeds are produced with moderate fertilization. 
 
' WHERE symbol='tyla';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD cs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Management='Heavy grazing will eliminate Typha species as well 
as other native species from riparian corridors.  
However, cattails are fairly resistant to moderate 
grazing, providing wet soils are not compacted. 
 
Because cattails have relatively little value for ducks, 
they are often regarded as undesirable weeds in 
places intended primarily for ducks.  It has been 
found that mowing cattails after the heads are well 
formed but not mature and then following up with 
another mowing about a month later, when new 
growth is two or three feet high, will kill at least 75% 
of the plants.  This will enable other emergent 
vegetation with more palatable and nutritious seeds to 
become established. 
 
Ecologically, cattails tend to invade native plant 
communities when hydrology, salinity, or fertility 
changes.  In this case they out compete native 
species, often becoming monotypic stands of dense 
cattails.  Maintaining water flows into the wetland, 
reducing nutrient input and maintaining salinity in 
tidal marshes will help maintain desirable species 
composition.  If cattails begin to invade, physical 
removal may be necessary.

© Noble Foundation
Alternative Names 
Chinese elm, dwarf elm, Asiatic elm 
 
Uses 
Ethnobotanic: The dried inner bark was grounded 
into a powder and used as a thickener in soups or 
added to cereal flours when making bread.  The 
immature fruit was used to produce a sauce and a 
wine (Facciola 1990).  The hardy, heavy tough wood 
was used for agricultural implements and boat 
making (Vines 1987). 
 
Agroforestry: Ulmus pumila is used in tree strips for 
windbreaks.  They are planted and managed to 
protect livestock, enhance production, and control 
soil erosion.  Windbreaks can help communities with 
harsh winter conditions better handle the impact of 
winter storms and reduce home heating and cooling 
costs. 
 
Status 
Considered a noxious weed in New Mexico.  Please 
consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s 
current status, such as, state noxious status and 
wetland indicator values. 
 
Description 
General: Elm Family (Ulmaceae).  Siberian elm 
(Ulmus pumila) is an introduced, fast-growing, small 
tree, five to ten meters high.  The leaves are alternate, 
simple, elliptic to oblong-lanceolate, usually simple 
serrate and 2.54  to 8 cm long.  The flowers are 
greenish, clustered, short pediceled and appear with 
or before the leaves from March through April (Vines 
1960).  The bark is light grayish-brown, irregularly 
furrowed, and often streaked with stains caused by 
bacterial wetwood.  The fruit is a long and broad 
samara, appearing from March through April, 
composed of a central, dry, compressed nutlet 
surrounded by a thin wing. (Ibid.). 
 
Distribution: Siberian elm is a fast-growing tree that 
was introduced to the United States in the 1860 s. 
Native to northern China, eastern Siberia, Manchuria, 
and Korea.  It is the hardest of all elms and does well 
even in areas with cold winters and long periods of 
summer droughts.  Because this, elm tolerates a 
variety of conditions such as poor soils and low 
moisture, it is found in dry regions, along roadsides, 
in pastures and grasslands.  For current distribution, 
please consult the Plant profile page for this species 
on the PLANTS Web site. 
 
Adaptation 
Ulmus pumila is easily grown in any well-drained 
soil type but prefers well-drained fertile soil.  This 
species prefers full sun and succeeds well in arid 
regions. The tree also grows in moist soils along 
streams.  It invades dry and mesic prairies, including 
sand prairies, drought resistant and fairly wind 
tolerant. 
 
Establishment 
Propagation by Seed: Siberian elm seeds should be 
sown as soon as ripe in a cold frame.  Excessive 
drying and dewinging should be avoided as they 
reduce viability (Dirr &amp. Heuser 1987). Twelve to 
twenty seeds are sown per linear feet in drills ten 
inches apart and covered ¼ inch with firmed soil.  
The seedbeds should be kept moist, but not 
particularly shaded.  When the seedlings are large 
enough to handle, place them into individual pots and

Management 
Siberian elm has been planted in the Upper Midwest 
in shelterbelts and as a shade trees along boulevards 
and in parks (Rosendahl 1955).  Some of the 
plantings have proved successful while others have 
not, because the seeds were derived from climatically 
different areas of the species geographical range, 
which varies in the level of winter hardiness (Ibid.).   
 
Siberian elm seeds with three to eight percent 
moisture can be stored at 36 to 40ºF in sealed 
containers for eight years (Dirr &amp. Heuser 1987).  
Seedlings should not be allowed to grow in a nursery 
bed for more than two years because the plant will 
develop a taproot that make lifting harder and 
reduces outplanting survival rates.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_Uses='Ethnobotanic: This tree was valued for its bark, 
which supplied material for the sides of winter 
houses and roofs of the Meskwaki.  The inner bark 
was used for cordage by many tribes.  The Menomini 
gathered the bark, boiled it, and used it for making 
fiber bags and large storage baskets.  The Dakota, 
Omaha-Ponca, Winnebago, and Pawnee used the 
inner bark fiber for making ropes and cords.  Slippery 
elm was also used extensively as a medicine.  The 
Iroquois scraped the bark of the tree and used it in 
combination with other plants to treat infected and 
swollen glands.  The inner bark was made into an eye 
wash for sore eyes.  The Menomini used the inner 
bark in a tea and it was taken as a physic.  The inner 
bark was used by the Menomini and the Meskwaki in 
a poultice to heal sores on the body.  Meskwaki 
women drank a tea of the bark to make childbirth 
easier. The tree also was used by the Ojibwe to treat 
sore throats.  The fresh inner bark was boiled and the 
Dakota, Omaha-Ponca, and other tribes drank the 
resulting decoction as a laxative.  The indigenous 
people generously taught some of these uses to early 
non-Indian settlers.  Today slippery elm is found in 
health food stores and is used to relieve sore throats,

winter-buds are densely covered with red-brown 
hairs.  The leaves are oblong to obovate, thick and 
stiff and 10-20 cm.  They are pinnately veined and 
not equilateral.  The flowers are subsessile in dense 
fascicles with 5-9 stamens.  They appear before the

gathered when green and ripe from April to June, by 
sweeping them up from the ground soon after they 
fall or by knocking the branches with poles and 
collecting seeds that fall onto tarps.  The seeds should 
then be air-dried for several days, but too much 
drying can reduce germination.  Sow the seeds in 
flats as soon as they are mature.  Sow them with their 
wings, as de-winging them damages them.  There are 
approximately 90 seeds per gram.  Seeds sometimes 
show dormancy and if so, need stratification.  They 
should be stratified at 41° F for 60-90 days in a moist 
medium.  If storing the seeds before planting, for best 
results, store them at low moisture content in sealed 
containers at cool temperatures.  Seedlings are 
susceptible to damping off.  In the seedling stage,

Miwok, Yuki, and Salinan are among the California 
tribes that value California laurel trees for its many 
uses.   
 
All parts of the plant, but especially the leaves, 
contain an aromatic camphor-like volatile oil that has 
cooling, irritant, insecticidal and germicidal qualities 
(Chestnut 1902).  Laurel leaves were tucked into and 
under hats or into headbands made of laurel twigs to 
relieve headaches (Barrett &amp. Gifford 1933).  The 
                          Plant Guide  
 
Salinan tribe treated sudden fits and probably 
headaches by making a headband of the aromatic 
laurel leaves (Heinsen 1972).  The Catholic Fathers at 
Mission San Antonio de Padua, borrowing from 
Salinan medicinal practices, made a hot poultice of 
laurel leaves mixed with nutmeg, cinnamon, and 
olive oil, which was repeatedly applied to the head of 
persons suffering fits until they regained 
consciousness.  The Kashaya Pomo made a poultice 
of laurel leaves that was used to treat rheumatism and 
neuralgia (Goodrich et al. 1980).  The Pomo and 
Yuki tribes of Mendocino County treated headaches 
by placing a single leaf in the nostril or bathing the 
head with a laurel leaf infusion (Chestnut 1902).   
 
Laurel leaf tea was drunk to treat stomachaches, 
colds, sore throats, and to clear up mucus in the lungs 
(Chestnut 1902, Goodrich et al. 1980, Timbrook 
1990).  The leaves were steeped in hot water to make 
an infusion that was used to wash sores (Goodrich et 
al. 1980).  Laurel leaves were steeped in baths for 
rheumatic patients.  Infusions of the leaves were used 
to rid the head of lice.  Leaves and branches were 
placed around the yard to discourage fleas.   
 
Both the flesh and the inner kernel of the olive-like 
fruit were used as food.  The fruits were sun dried 
until the fleshy outer part had split and loosened from 
the pit (Goodrich et al. 1980).  The dried flesh was 
removed from the seeds ready to eat.  Only the 
bottom third of the outer dried fruit was eaten as the 
upper, thinner part contains a higher concentration of 
the acrid oil that is a component of all parts of the 
tree (Chestnut 1902).  The seeds were roasted until 
they were crisp and brown (Goodrich et al. 1980).  
The roasting removes much of the pungency and 
leaves just a hint of acridity and gives the roasted 
nuts a spicy or coffee-like flavor.  The parched nuts 
are then shelled and either eaten whole or pounded 
into a meal.  The oily meal is easily pressed into 
small cakes that are then sun-dried and stored for use 
in the winter.  Both the nuts and the cakes were 
served with clover, seaweed, buckeye meal, or acorn 
meal and mush.  The roasted seeds were eaten as an 
accompaniment with clover in order to prevent 
bloating (Murphey 1959).  The seed meal was also 
made into a beverage that tasted “like chocolate” 
(Kelly 1978).   
 
California laurel was an important ceremonial plant 
for the Kashaya Pomo (Goodrich et al. 1980).

laurel leaves to attract and stupefy deer (Timbrook 
1990).   
 
Wildlife: Black-tailed deer browse on the leaves and 
twigs, which are high in protein (Howard 1992).  
Birds, squirrels, and other small mammals eat the 
seeds.  Wild pigs eat the seeds and the roots.  The 
trees provide valuable cover for deer, black bear, 
wild pigs, game birds, and songbirds.  
 
Conservation: California laurel has been used to 
restore wildlife habitat, riparian vegetation, and flood 
controls (Howard 1992).   
 
Wood products: California laurel is a high quality 
wood that is used for cabinetry, furniture, paneling,

Description 
General: Laurel family (Lauraceae).  California 
laurel is a perennial, evergreen tree or shrub that is 
native to California and southern Oregon.  The trees 
have many slender erect branches and a dense crown 
that can be rounded to pyramidal in shape.  The 
height is variable depending on conditions and the 
plants can grow from 3 to 45 meters tall.  The 
smallest forms are found under dry conditions and 
they reach their greatest size on deep alluvial soils 
near rivers.   
 
The greenish to reddish brown bark, which is thin 
and smooth on young trees, begins to peel and shed 
as the trees mature.  The alternately arranged leaves 
are oblong to lance-shaped (2.5 to 11 cm long and 1.5 
to 3 cm wide).  Leaves are glossy dark yellow-green, 
thick, and leathery.  When crushed, the leaves give 
off a strong peppery menthol-like odor, which is the 
reason the early European settlers gave the tree the 
name pepperwood.  The small yellow-green flowers 
are borne in clusters of 6 to 10 flowers.  The round 
olive-like fruits (1 to 2.5cm in diameter) turn from 
green to deep brown-purple.  Inside the fruit is a 
single large seed, which is a white kernel surrounded 
by a light brown shell.   
 
 
 
Distribution: California laurel is distributed from San 
Diego County to Northwestern California and into 
southwestern Oregon.  In California, it occurs in both 
the Coast Ranges and Sierra Nevada.  For current 
distribution, please consult the Plant Profile page for 
this species on the PLANTS Web site.   
 
Habitat: California laurel trees are abundant near 
water sources in alluvial flood plains as well as shady 
hillsides and canyons below 1600 meters.  The trees 
occur in oak woodlands, mixed evergreen forest, 
redwood forest, and chaparral.  In chaparral 
communities they grow in canyons, valleys, and 
sometimes in high rocky areas were they are able tap 
into moisture.

deep, fertile soils that are well drained, with regular 
water availability.  California laurel trees can tolerate 
dry conditions but are known to dieback during 
droughts (Labadie 1978).   
 
California laurel is propagated from fresh seeds.  
Seeds can be collected from October to December 
(Mirov &amp. Kraebel 1939).  The seeds are mature when 
they are dark brown and the fruits are dark purple 
(Young 2001).  Labadie (1978) suggests lightly 
cracking the seeds before planting to increase

of loose soil or a mixture of equal parts peat moss 
and perlite.  Lightly moisten the mixture and place it 
into a plastic bag that can be tightly sealed.  Place the 
bag in a refrigerator kept at 30-42°F and examine 
them periodically for signs of germination.  The 
seeds generally take around 93 days to germinate.  If 
any of the seeds begin to germinate, plant them

Each family would harvest and store approximately 
four or five pecks (ca. four to five gallons) of dried 
berries for winter use (Perkins n.d. (1838-43), Book 
1:10).  Hunn (1990) estimates that there were 28-42 
huckleberry harvest days in a year.  This resulted in a 
total annual harvest of 63.9-80.2 kg/woman/year 
from the Tenino-Wishram area, and 90 
kg/woman/year from the Umatilla area.  The net 
result was a huckleberry harvest yield of 31 
kcal/person/day in the Tenino-Wishram area and 42 
kcal/person/day for the Umatilla area (Hunn 1981: 
130-131).  Vaccinium species contain 622 Kcal per 
100 gm huckleberries, with 15.3 gm carbohydrate, 
0.5 gm fat, 0.7 gm protein and 83.2 gm water (Hunn 
1981:130-131). 
 
In the fall, after the harvest, it was common for the 
Sahaptin to burn these areas to create favorable 
habitat (Henry Lewis 1973, 1977).  Fire creates 
sunny openings in the forest and edges that foster the 
rapid spread of nutritious herbs and shrubs that favors 
the huckleberries (Minore 1972:68).  
 
The leaves and berries are high in vitamin C.  The 
leaves and finely chopped stems contain quinic acid, 
a former therapeutic for gout said to inhibit uric acid 
formation but never widely used because of mixed 
clinical results.  The leaves have been widely used to 
lower or modify blood sugar levels.  Many herbalists 
maintain that bilberry-leaf tea may be useful in 
stabilizing blood sugar levels in cases of diabetes, 
and medical research has shown that consumption of 
the leaf extract decreases blood sugar levels shortly 
after administration.  Taken on regular basis, bilberry 
tea will gradually help alleviate both glycosuria and 
hyperglycemia and has a benign but useful effect as 
an adjunct treatment to diabetes mellitus.  The leaves 
are believed also to stimulate appetite, and have 
astringent and antiseptic qualities that are useful in 
urinary disorders.  
 
Other Uses: Cascade bilberry has a particularly sweet 
berry, and is prized for its flavor.  The berries are 
eaten fresh, baked in pancakes, pies, and muffins, 
canned, frozen, or made into jams and jellies.  Berries 
are usually picked in late July or August.  The leaves 
can be used fresh or dried to make a tea.  
 
Elk and deer browse the foliage of cascade bilberry.  
Flowers attract butterflies and other insects.  For

were eaten raw and fresh, or were cooked, mashed, 
and dried in the sun in cakes.  Columbia Plateau 
Indians of Washington dried surplus berries slowly 
over a fire kept smoldering in a rotten log (Filloon 
1952).  This method of drying the berries preserves 
the bulk of the Vitamin C content in the fruits 
(Norton et al. 1984:223).  The dried berries are 
sometimes mixed with pounded salmon and a good 
portion of salmon oil, making a delicious dish. 
 
After the huckleberry feast, the Sahaptin people of 
the Columbia plateau traveled to the productive berry 
fields higher in the mountains for a series of day, 
overnight, or weekend trips.  The knowledge of the 
location of the berries is part of an Indian family s 
inheritance (Hunn 1990).  Special berry picking

Seed Collections: Collect the berries in late summer 
or early fall.  Clean the seeds by macerating in water, 
floating off the pulp, then allow the seeds to dry.  
Seeds require no stratification and can be sown on a 
moist peat surface.  Temperatures of 18° C (for 12 
hours) during the day and 13° C (for 12 hours) are 
ideal for germination.  Seven weeks after 
germination, change temperatures to 20° C (for 14 
hours) and 14° C (for 10 hours).  Fertilize seedlings 
10 weeks after germination.  After the seedlings are 
12 weeks old, transplant to a peat sand (1:1) media in 
individual pots (Minore and Smart 1978).  The soil

in the mountains.  They ate huckleberries fresh with 
meat. partially dried  
 
them, crushed them and formed them into cakes. or 
fully dried them.  In British Columbia, the 
Kwakwaka wakw cooked them with salmon roe and 
the Sechelt smoke-dried them, using black 
huckleberry branches as part of the fuel.  
 
A first fruits ceremony or feast is held by many 
nations in the Pacific Northwest, including the 
Columbia Plateau Indians, the Umatilla, the Yakima, 
the Warm Springs, and the Colville Confederated 
Tribes.  Huckleberry feasts are held in July or 
August, coinciding with the first berry harvest.  A 
thanksgiving ceremony is held at this time, with 
gratitude expressed through prayer, dancing, and 
celebration.  Feasts used to also be given at a girl s 
first berry picking or root gathering and at the first 
procuring of game by a boy.  These generally 
occurred when the child was ten years old.  At these 
feasts, they served food procured by the child along 
with other foods.  The elders praised and blessed the 
work of the child, giving the child the power to 
become great and successful later in life.  
 
After the huckleberry feast, the Sahaptin people of 
the Columbia Plateau would leave for a seasonal 
migration to the mountains to gather berries and to 
escape the summer heat.  Special baskets, called 
&quot.Klikitat baskets&quot. of cedar root decorated with bear 
grass and bitter cherry bark, were used for berry 
picking.  The surplus berries were dried slowly over a 
fire that was kept smoldering in a rotten log (Filloon 
1952).  This method of drying the berries preserves 
the bulk of the Vitamin C content in the fruits 
(Norton et al. 1984:223).  
 
Each family from the Columbia Plateau area would 
gather four or five pecks (ca. four to five gallons) of 
dried berries for winter use (Perkins n.d. (1838-43), 
Book 1:10).  Hunn (1990) estimates that there were 
28-42 harvest days in a year.  This resulted in a total 
annual harvest of 63.9-80.2 kg/woman/year from the 
Tenino-Wishram area, and 90 kg/woman/year from 
the Umatilla area.  The net result was a huckleberry 
harvest yield of 31 kcal/person/day in the Tenino-
Wishram area and 42 kcal/person/day for the 
Umatilla area (Hunn 1981: 130-131).  Vaccinium 
species contain 622 Kcal per 100 gm berries, with 
15.3 gm carbohydrate, 0.5 gm fat, 0.7 gm protein and 
83.2 gm water (Hunn 1981:130-131).

Huckleberries are used for a lavender or purple 
natural dye in the twined corn husk bags made by the 
Nez Perce. the cornhusks are dyed with the juice of 
the berries.  The Nlaka pamux sometimes used the 
leaves in smoking mixture (Turner 1990). 
Other Uses: Vaccinium membranaceum is the most 
highly regarded of the huckleberry species within its 
range, especially in British Columbia and 
neighboring areas (Turner 1975, 1978).  People of all 
cultures love these huckleberries.  Today, the berries 
are eaten fresh, baked in pancakes, pies, and muffins, 
canned, frozen, or made into jams and jellies.  Berries 
are usually picked in late July or August.  The leaves 
can be used fresh or dried to make a tea.   
 
Huckleberry leaves and finely chopped stems contain 
quinic acid, a former therapeutic for gout said to 
inhibit uric acid formation but never widely used

Wildlife: Huckleberry fruits are an important food 
source for songbirds, gulls, cranes, pigeons, turkeys, 
and upland game birds.  Many mammals, from black 
bears to mice, feed on red huckleberries.  Herbivores 
graze on the entire plant. it appears to be a favorite 
browse of deer.  Huckleberries and blueberries form a 
major part of the grizzly and black bear s diet in late 
summer and fall.  Grouse feast on the leaves and 
blossoms.  The fruits, twigs, and foliage are eaten by 
foxes, opossums, raccoons, squirrels, deer, moose, 
caribou, elk, pikas, cottontail rabbits, and skunks.

huckleberry is an erect, deciduous shrub 0.1-2 m tall.  
The leaves, up to 5 cm long, are elliptical with a long 
pointed tip and a finely serrated margin.  The bell-
shaped flowers are creamy-pink, and are found singly 
on the underside of the twigs.  The berries are large, 
spherical, sweet, and dark purple or black.  In some 
forms the berries are covered with a waxy bloom. 
others have shiny dark berries. 
 
 
 
Distribution: For current distribution, please consult 
the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site.  Black huckleberry is found in 
thickets and on Montana slopes in coniferous woods 
at elevations from 1000-1800 m.  It grows in sandy or 
gravelly soils, ranging from moist to dry growing 
conditions.  Vaccinium membranaceum grows from 
British Columbia to Alberta and Ontario, north to the 
Mackenzie Delta area, south to California in the 
Klamath Range and North Coast Range, and east to 
Michigan.

Cuttings: Take cuttings from rhizomes in early spring

cut them into lengths of 10 cm or longer.  Place the 
cuttings in vermiculite at 21 °C.  Once the roots are

a peat:sand soil mixture (1:1) potting soil.  The soil 
should be kept fairly moist.  When plants are the size 
desired, plant in soils that are fairly acidic, or add the 
peat-sand mixture to the soil before planting.  Plants 
must be kept well watered to become established.  
Plants establish well in partial shade. 
 
Seeds: Collect the berries in the fall and clean by 
running them through a blender with dull blades, 
straining the pulp with a sieve, and spreading them to 
dry on a paper towel.  Most authors believe that the 
seeds require no stratification or scarification 
(Haeussler et al. 1990. Link 1993. Minore and Smart 
1978).  However, Albright (1996) found poor 
germination without stratification and recommends 
over-wintering of seeds in flats outside.  Seeds 
germinate within 16-21 days of sowing.  Germination 
percentages can be improved by sowing the seed on 
moist peat in a growth chamber at 18° C (for 12 hours 
a day) and 13° C (for 12 hours a day).  Seven weeks 
after germination warm the growth chamber to 20 ° C 
(for 14 hours a day) and 14° C (for 10 hours a day).  
Fertilize the seedlings after they are 10 weeks old and 
transplant into a peat-sand soil mixture (1:1) in 
individual pots after 12 weeks (Minore and Smart 
1978).  The soil should be kept fairly moist.

Center &amp. Oregon Plant Materials Center 
stabilizing blood sugar levels in cases of diabetes, 
and medical research has shown that consumption of 
the leaf extract decreases blood sugar levels shortly 
after administration.  Taken on regular basis, 
huckleberry tea will gradually help alleviate both 
glycosuria and hyperglycemia and appears to have a 
beginning, but useful effect as an adjunct treatment to 
diabetes mellitus.  The leaves are believed also to 
stimulate appetite, and have astringent and antiseptic 
qualities that are useful in urinary disorders.  
 
Horticulture: Evergreen huckleberry is an excellent 
horticultural choice due to its beautiful, glossy, 
evergreen foliage and tolerance of a wide range of 
light levels.  The foliage is often used in flower 
arrangements.  
 
Wildlife &amp. Livestock: The foliage of evergreen 
huckleberry is browsed by elk and deer.  Flowers 
attract butterflies.  For several species of grouse, 
huckleberries are among the most important summer 
and early fall foods.  Berries are eaten by chipmunks, 
black bear, mice, scarlet tanagers, bluebirds, thrushes, 
and other songbirds.  Deer and rabbit browse freely 
on the plants.  Because of their food value to wildlife 
and their dense shrubby growth, evergreen 
huckleberry is worthy of inclusion in hedgerows.  
 
In some localities goats and deer crop evergreen 
huckleberry rather closely, utilizing 30 to 40 % of the 
leafage and current twigs.  Sheep crop it somewhat 
less closely but it enters into their diet to a 
considerable extent in late summer and autumn.  The 
browse rating is fair to poor for sheep, goats, and 
deer. poor to useless to cattle. and useless for horses.

huckleberry.  These tribes include the Sechelt, 
Comox, Straits, Halkomelem, Lower Nlaka pamux 
Salish, Nuu-chah-nulth (Vancouver Island s West 
Coast), and the Quinault of Washington.  Evergreen 
huckleberries were well liked and people often 
traveled great distances to obtain them.  The berries 
ripen late in the year, around October or November.  
They are the last fruits to be gathered in the season 
round and are said to be even tastier after freezing.  
The berries are eaten fresh, usually with oil. The 
berries are also sun or smoke dried, partly mashed, 
pressed into cake form, and wrapped in leaves or 
bark.  Today they are made into jam or used in 
cooking. 
 
The leaves and berries are high in vitamin C.  The 
leaves and finely chopped stems contain quinic acid, 
a former therapeutic for gout said to inhibit uric acid 
formation but never widely used because of mixed 
clinical results.  The leaves have been widely used to 
lower or modify blood sugar levels.  Many herbalists

edges and 
clearings of 
coniferous 
woods, at 
elevations from 
3-800 m.  
Evergreen 
huckleberry can 
also be found 
near beaches in 
the salt spray 
zone.  This 
huckleberry 
grows in moist to 
slightly dry soils.  
It will grow in 
full sun to full 
shade, although 
the plants prefer 
some shade. 
 
Propagation: Evergreen huckleberry can be difficult 
to propagate or transplant, but it is available in some 
nurseries.  It can be grown from cuttings, from seed, 
or by layering.  Huckleberry cuttings should be taken 
while the plant is dormant, from November to April.  
Their rooting success is fairly sporadic. 
 
Evergreen huckleberry requires excessive drainage 
and acidic soils to become established.  It does best in 
full or partial shade. it may tolerate morning and 
winter sun.  
 
Live Plant Collections: Evergreen huckleberry is 
propagated by cuttings from fully matured shoots 
taken in fall and winter, when the plant is dormant.  
Cuttings made from the previous year s growth taken 
the third week in April rooted 100% (Vancouver, 
B.C.).  Application of 0.3 to 0.4% IBA talc to the 
freshly cut stem surface and basal heat (21°C. 70° F) 
to potted plants will enhance rooting.

Young plants can be salvaged, but they should be 
transplanted when they are less than one foot tall.  
Frequently, these small plants will turn out to be new 
shoots of a mature plant reviving from deer browsing 
or logging, and will die from lack of roots. 
 
Seed Collections: Berries should be collected when 
they are ripe (from August to September or later).  
The blue-black fruit is easily collected by hand 
picking or by beating the bush over a large bucket.  
Following collection, chill the fruit at 10°C for 
several days.  Clean seeds by macerating and floating 
off the pulp and unsound seed.  Clean seeds 
carefully. they are minuscule, so you may want to use 
pantyhose or cheesecloth to strain the seed from the 
pulp. 
 
Seeds dried at 15-21°C for two days can be stored in 
a refrigerator for up to 12 years.  Fresh seeds not 
planted in the fall may germinate better if cold 
stratified for 1-3 months.  Stored seeds germinates 
well when exposed to alternating temperature and 
light regimes of 28°C light for 14 hours a day and 
13°C dark for 10 hours. 
 
Fresh or stored and cold-stratified seeds can be sown 
directly into flats or small pots (a salt shaker can be 
used for sowing).  Plant in a mixture of sand and peat 
moss.  Seedlings will begin to emerge in a month and 
will continue to emerge for a long period thereafter.  
Transplant seedlings into larger pots 6 to 7 weeks 
after emergence.  Plant outside after the first growing 
season.  Seedlings are slow growing, and it may take 
2-3 years for a nursery-sized plant to develop.

these fruits in their food economy (Waterman 1920).  
 
Small cranberries were gathered wild in England and 
Scotland and made into tarts, marmalade, jelly, jam, 
and added to puddings and pies (Eastwood 1856). 
Many colonists were already familiar with this fruit 
in Great Britain before finding it in North America. 
The small cranberry helped stock the larder of 
English and American ships, fed trappers in remote 
regions, and pleased the palates of Meriwether Lewis 
and William Clark in their explorations across the 
United States (Lewis and Clark 1965). The Chinook, 
for example, traded dried cranberries with the 
English vessel Ruby in 1795 and at Thanksgiving in 
1805 Lewis and Clark dined on venison, ducks, 
geese, and small cranberry sauce from fruit brought 
by Chinook women (McDonald 1966. Lewis and 
Clark 1965). Because the small cranberry can grow in 
association with large cranberry (Vaccinium 
macrocarpon) in the Great Lakes region, northeastern 
USA and southeastern Canada (Boniello 1993. Roger 
Latham pers. comm. 2009) it is possible that the 
Pilgrims of Plymouth were introduced to both edible 
species by the Wampanoag. 
 
The berries are still gathered today in the United 
States, Canada, and Europe (Himelrick 2005). The 
Makah, Quinault, and Quileute of the Olympic 
Peninsula still gather them every fall and non-Indians 
from early settler families still gather them (Anderson 
2009). Small cranberries are an important source of 
phenolic compounds, especially anthocyanins, that 
show high anti-oxidant potential (Kahkonen et al. 
2001. Kahkonen et al. 1999). They are an excellent 
source of flavonols, having higher concentrations 
than apples (Himelrick 2005). 
 
There were many indigenous ways to prepare and eat 
cranberries. Berries could be eaten fresh, boiled, 
baked in a pit, dried or stored for future use, and in 
later times they were canned and used for making 
jams, jellies, and pies (Gill 1984. Olson 1936). In 
western Washington, the berries were usually stored 
in boxes or baskets until soft and brown (Gunther 
1973). For example, among the Quileute on the 
Olympic Peninsula cranberries either sat in storage 
until they became soft, or they were crushed and 
eaten with grease (Powell and Morganroth 1998).

Uses 
Said to have a superior flavor to the cultivated 
cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) (Shepard 1855. 
Eastwood 1856), large quantities of the tart berries 
were gathered in the fall by tribes of the Great Lakes 
region such as the Menomini and Potawatomi (Smith 
1923. Smith 1933), tribes of the Northeast such as the 
Iroquois and Lenape (Stout 1914. Waugh 1916), the 
Inuit of Alaska (Trehane 2004), the Chinook of 
Oregon, and the Makah, Klallam, Hoh, Quileute, 
Quinault, and Chemakum of western Washington 
(Gunther 1973. Hedrick 1972. Eells 1996. Archibald 
1999). The First Nations of Canada, such as the 
Haida, Kwakwaka wakw, and other cultural groups 
also relished the berries (Turner 2004. U mista 
Cultural Society et al. 1998). Because the berries last 
through the winter and preserve well under the snow, 
they could also be gathered in spring as was done by 
the Dena ina of south-central Alaska and the Woods 
Cree of Canada (Kari 1987. Leighton 1985). Even 
though they are small, the importance of these berries 
to many indigenous cultures should not be 
underestimated. The fact that the month of September 
is connected with &quot.the season for cranberries&quot. in the 
Makah lunar calendar underscores the importance of

was made by pounding cranberries into a mixture of 
dried, smoked game meat, animal fat, and seeds 
(Kavasch 1995). The Canadian Chippewa combined 
dried berries with moose fat or deer tallow (Buttree 
1932).  The Kwakwaka wakw of western British 
Columbia ate the berries fresh to quench thirst or 
dried them into cakes. Their favorite way to prepare 
them was to boil them and serve them with grease 
(U mista Cultural Society et al. 1998) from eulachon 
(Thaleichthys pacificus), a small West-coast fish.  
Early non-Indian settlers, having learned of their 
edibility from the Indians, made cranberry sauces, 
bubbling tarts, and nogs from cranberries. The 
Indians of western Washington also used the fruit as 
a paint (Eells 1996).  
 
Wildlife: The berries are eaten by many kinds of 
animals such as Roosevelt elk, black bears, black-
tailed deer, foxes, squirrels, chipmunks, rabbits, and 
hares (Anderson 2009. Jacquemart 1997. Matthews 
1992). Birds such as wild geese, Hudsonian godwits, 
sharp-tailed grouse, and ring-necked pheasants also 
eat small cranberries (Matthews 1992. Haskin 1934). 
The small cranberry is a larval food plant for the 
listed Makah copper butterfly in western Washington 
(Pyle and Pyle 2001). Many birds use small cranberry 
ecosystems for foraging and/or nesting including the 
rock ptarmigan, willow ptarmigan, common loon, 
double-crested cormorant, great blue heron, Canada 
goose, killdeer, American wigeon, and many others 
(Jacquemart 1997. Czech and Parsons 2002). 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s 
current status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, 
state noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
Description 
General:  A member of the heath family (Ericaceae), 
small cranberry is a trailing, vine-like shrub with 
delicate stems that often creep over Sphagnum moss. 
The plant has alternate small evergreen leaves with 
rolled edges that are dark green above, pale beneath, 
and pointed at the tip. The pale rose flowers have 
petals that are bent backwards. The one to four 
flowers appear between May and August and look 
like small shooting stars. They form a terminal 
cluster and spring from the tips of stems (Gleason 
and Cronquist 1991. Pettinger and Costanzo 2002).  
The red, sometimes off-white berry is small (3/8 inch 
wide), round, and slightly acid, ripening between 
August and October (Jacquemart 1997. Clark 1998. 
Piper and Beattie 1915. Pojar and MacKinnon 1994. 
Pettinger and Costanzo 2002). The plant is similar in 
appearance to the cultivated cranberry (Gleason and 
Cronquist 1991). 
 
 
Small cranberry distribution from USDA-NRCS PLANTS 
Database. 
The small cranberry occurs throughout Alaska and 
across Canada to Labrador, Greenland, and 
Newfoundland, south through the New England 
states, the northern portions of the Great Lake States, 
and western Washington and Oregon. It also occurs 
in northern Europe and Asia (Matthews 1992. 
Gleason and Cronquist 1991). For current 
distribution, please consult the Plant Profile page for 
this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
 
Habitat:  The small cranberry is found in wetlands: 
bogs, swamps, and muskegs and along the marshy 
shores of ponds and lakes. Many of these wetlands 
were created by the melting of glaciers 10,000 to 
18,000 year ago (Jones 1936). This species often 
occurs where there is no perched water table caused 
by a hardpan. The typical habitat of this species is 
Sphagnum peat and sometimes sand or hardpan. This 
vine is occasionally found in tidal wetlands along 
both the western and eastern shores of North America 
(Tiner 2009. Gunther 1973). Since the small 
cranberry is shade intolerant, relic stands occur in 
bogs that have developed a conifer overstory 
(Conway 1949. Matthews 1992). It is found in small 
swamps in pine barrens in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, 
New York and New England. 
Adaptation 
Small cranberry is one of the first colonizers of 
burned bogs and increases in abundance with 
repeated fires if the fires are not too severe (Flinn and 
Wein 1977. Vogl 1964. Matthews 1992). It also 
regenerates vegetatively by re-growing from 
rhizomes and by layering (Flinn and Wein 1988. 
Matthews 1992).  
Establishment 
Small cranberry can be propagated by seeds or by 
cuttings or by severing sectors of rooted runners 
(Trehane 2004). Cuttings should be taken during the 
dormant season, and treated with rooting hormone 
(Leopold 2005). It needs a sunny location in the 



Page 3
garden with wet to moist, acidic and often peaty soils 
(Pettinger and Costanzo 2002). 
Management 
Early non-Indian descriptions of the small cranberry 
paint a picture of abundance. Albert Reagan reported 
in 1928 for the Bois Fort Ojibwa of Minnesota that: 
&quot.Cranberries [both Vaccinium macrocarpon and V. 
oxycoccos] are very plentiful in the swampy regions 
and are quite an article of food. Many bushels of 
them are sold by the Indians each year (Reagan 
1928). Part of the coast of Lake Superior was 
described as &quot.flaming red with [Vaccinium 
oxycoccos] berries&quot. in 1855 (Eastwood 1856). James 
Swan recorded in his diary on October 23, 1859 
about the northwest coast of Washington that &quot.Mr. 
Webster shipped on board of the Hartford 23 barrels 
of cranberries [Vaccinium oxycoccos] &quot. (Swan 1859-
1866). These barrels were obtained from the Makah.

Reports of such large quantities suggest the 
possibility of Indian stewardship to increase fruit 
yields. Lightning is rare within the Pacific 
northwestern distribution of small cranberries (Agee 
1993. Kay 2007. Vitt et al. 1990), and tribes 
maintained them by burning (Anderson 2009. 
Latham 2008). The primary role of fire was to keep 
open habitats for the small cranberries and other 
useful plants. Burning arrested the processes of 
succession that would otherwise have allowed the 
forest to advance, which would have reduced sunlight 
 
 
to the fruit-bearing plants, increased competition for 
nutrients, and made the plants more difficult to get to 
and harvest. Gregory Colfax, Makah, explains this 
function of burning in relation to small cranberries: 
“My dad [Lloyd Colfax] mentioned that the [Ts’oo-
yuhs] prairie was burned yearly or whenever it was 
necessary. When the cranberry bogs would get so 
overgrown then the folks knew that it was time to do 
it. And so it was generally in autumn I think when it 
happened—just at the time when you had your long 
spells of light summer weather in September and 
October. And it was the perfect time to do it because 
you match it to the wind and you match it to 
upcoming rains” (pers. comm.).  
 
Indian burning of bogs also had a directly beneficial 
effect on individual cranberry plants, maintaining 
vigor and stimulating the production of berries. 
Without pruning or burning, the vines produce many 
runners, and produce less and less fruit. Traditionally 
tribes in western Washington, such as the Quinault 
and the Makah, burned off bogs periodically not only 
to keep them open by eliminating encroaching shrubs 
and trees but also to stimulate the plants to produce 
more fruit (Anderson 2009). This probably would 
have a similar effect to the pruning of the cultivated 
cranberry practiced by growers today. They prune 
heavily vined cranberries for two reasons: 1) severing 
most of the runners removes apical dominance in 
many of the vines, promoting new uprights to 
produce fruit in the second year after pruning. and 2) 
removing top growth allows more sunlight to reach 
the vines, encouraging increased flower bud initiation 
(Eck 1990). Paul Eck (1990) instructs cranberry 
growers to burn or mow overgrown bogs during the 
dormant season to bring them back into productive 
bearing.   
 
Today conifers and hardwoods are advancing into 
bogs (Rigg 1922. Reichle and Doyle 1965. Tiner 
1991) where the small cranberries grow and this is 
partly due to the cessation of Indian-set fires that kept 
them open (Latham 2008. Anderson 2009) and to the 
later stages of forest regrowth after clearcutting.

into cakes and dried for the winter.  The Lower 
Chinook and Lummi preferred the berries raw, rather 
than drying them.  Other first people dried the 
berries.  Like other fruits, huckleberries were often 
eaten with some type of oil or animal/fish grease, and 
were often mixed with other berries, such as salal 
(Gaultheria shallon).  The berries, instead of being 
picked individually, are usually brushed or combed 
from the twigs.  Some people harvested the berries by 
clubbing the branches on the hand and letting the ripe 
berries fall into a basket. 
 
The Skagit boil the bark for a tea for colds.  The 
leaves and finely chopped stem contain quinic acid, a 
former therapeutic for gout said to inhibit uric acid 
formation, but never widely used because of mixed 
clinical results.  The leaves have been widely used to 
lower or modify blood sugar levels, particularly in 
Europe.  Taken on a regular basis, huckleberry tea 
will gradually help alleviate both glycosuria and 
hyperglycemia and has a benign, but useful effect as 
an adjunct treatment to diabetes mellitus. 
 
Wildlife.  Huckleberry fruits are an important food 
source for songbirds, gulls, cranes, pigeons, turkeys, 
and upland game birds.  Many mammals, from black 
bears to mice, feed on red huckleberries.  Herbivores 
graze on the entire plant.  It appears to be a favorite 
browse of deer.  Huckleberries and blueberries form a 
major part of the grizzly’s and black bear’s diet in 
late summer and fall.  Grouse feast on the leaves and 
blossoms.  The fruit, twigs, and foliage are eaten by 
foxes, opossums, raccoons, squirrels, deer, moose, 
caribou, elk, pikas, cottontail rabbits, and skunks.

Habitat: Red huckleberry grows on old decaying 
stumps or logs in moist coniferous woods, wetlands, 
or in the transition zone of wetlands.  It is absent or 
scarce in dry woods.  It is very shade tolerant.  Red 
huckleberry is one of the most frequent pioneering

old conifers become tended gardens for red 
huckleberry and salal berry orchards (Turner and 
Efrat 1982). 
 
Traditional resource management of this plant 
includes the following: 1) occasional burning to 
stimulate new growth. 2) pruning the branches after 
picking the berries to stimulate new growth and fruit 
production the next growing season. and 3) 
ownership of red huckleberry shrubs provides the 
basis for careful tending and sustainable yield of 
valued resources.

easily collected by hand picking or by beating the 
bush over a large bucket.  Following collection, chill 
the fruit to 10 degrees C for several days.  Clean the 
seeds by macerating and floating off the pulp and

well when exposed to alternating temperature and 
light regimes of 28 degrees C for 14 hours of day 
(light) and at 13 degrees C for 10 hours of dark. 
 
Fresh or stored and cold-stratified seeds can be sown 
directly into flats or small pots (a salt shaker can be 
used for sowing).  Plant in a mixture of sand and peat 
moss.  Seedlings will begin to emerge in a month and 
will continue to emerge for quite some time

Okanagan-Colville and Kootenay people in the 
Pacific Northwest.  The berries are picked with a 
comb and usually eaten fresh.  However, berries are 
gathered less commonly in modern times due to their

strawberries, the tiny red fruits are sweet and 
delicious and well worth the effort.  They are also 
used by backpackers. 
 
Grouse huckleberry is sometimes used

pink flowers and red fruits, and tolerance to a wide 
range of light levels. 
 
Wildlife.  For several species of grouse, these are 
among the most important summer and early fall 
foods.  They are also important to songbirds, 
chipmunks, mice, and other mammals.  Grouse

huckleberry is a small, broom-like, U.S. native, 
deciduous shrub &lt.5 dm tall.  The twigs are strongly 
angled and green.  The leaves are 8-15 mm, ovate, 
and serrate.  The flowers are solitary, urn-shaped, 
pink blossoms in the axils of the lowest leaves and 
youngest shoots.  The bright red berry is tiny, 3-6 
mm in diameter. 
 
Distribution: For current distribution, please consult 
the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site.  Grouse huckleberry ranges from 
Alaska south to California, northern New Mexico, the 
Rocky Mountains, and Alberta.  It can be found from 
760-2300 m in the Pacific Northwest, from 1800-
2300 m in California, and from 2600-3800 m in 
Colorado.  This plant is rare in California. 
 
Habitat: Grouse huckleberry grows in rocky 
subalpine to alpine woods to open slopes.  It grows in 
acidic soils in both moist and dry sites, but is most 
common in sandy or gravelly loams and is always 
found in the understory of lodgepole pine (Pinus 
contorta) stands.

macerating and floating the pulp and unsound seed 
off the top.  Seed should be dried before storing.  One 
study reported best germination with a cold 
stratification with warm night temperatures of 10

or early September, best when picked slightly under-
ripe (and sour), and used in sauces, jellies, and juices.  
If picked after a heavy frost, the fruit are softer and 
more palatable but they develop a musty, somewhat 
objectionable odor during cooking.  The species has 
never developed into a commercial fruit crop. 
 
Wildlife: The bright red fruits often persist on the 
plants throughout the winter, good for ornamental 
value but suggesting that they may not be especially 
palatable for wildlife.  Still, they are known to be 
eaten by deer, moose, foxes, raccoons, chipmunks, 
squirrels, skunks, mice, rabbits, grouse, pheasants, 
robins, cedar waxwings, and other songbirds.  They 
are not normally eaten by birds until after they have 
frozen and thawed several times.   
 
The native (American) plants of this species (= V. 
trilobum = V. opulus var. americanum, see below) are 
hardier as ornamentals, less susceptible to aphid 
attack, and have more intense fall color than the 
Eurasian plants, and they produce edible fruit.  Fruit 
of the European plants tends to be bitter, and 
cultivars derived from the European species are 
grown strictly as ornamentals.

The North American plants have generally been 
recognized as the same species as the closely similar 
native of Europe, northern Africa, and northern Asia 
– V. opulus L. [var. opulus].  Var. opulus is said to 
differ from the American variety in its filiform-
attenuate stipules and petiolar glands mostly short-
pedicellate, round-topped to concave, and mostly 
wider than high.  Voss (1996) notes that “variation 
between vars. opulus and americanum is too great – 
and too continuous – to make clear distinctions.”  
Variants have not generally been recognized from 
within the American segment of the species, but 
horticultural selections have been made from plants 
of both continents, primarily for leaf color, fruit 
color, and growth habit.  The best known of these is 
the cultivated “snowball bush” (V. opulus var. 
roseum), a form developed from Old World plants, 
with spherical inflorescences of enlarged, completely 
sterile flowers (the &quot.snowballs&quot.).   
 
The native variety (var. americanum) is known to 
hybridize with cultivated or escaped ornamental 
forms of var. opulus.  This may result in the gradual 
degradation or loss of the native genotype.     
 
Distribution: Var. americanum is widely distributed 
across north-central North America, from 
Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and 
Quebec to British Columbia, and in the US from 
Maine to Pennsylvania and West Virginia, 
northwestward to Washington.  For current 
distribution, please consult the Plant Profile page for 
this species on the PLANTS Web site.  The non-
native var. opulus is frequently planted and 
sometimes escapes. it is recorded from Ontario and 
New Brunswick and various states in the northeastern 
quarter of the US – Maine to Virginia and West 
Virginia, westward to Wisconsin, Iowa, and 
Missouri.

Highbush cranberry can be propagated through

June through early-July for easiest rooting.

Viburnum leaf beetle.  The viburnum leaf beetle 
(Pyrrhalta viburni), native to Europe and Asia, was 
first encountered in North America in 1947, perhaps 
arriving earlier from Europe on nursery plants.  It 
received little notice until 1978, when it caused 
severe defoliation of ornamental viburnums in 
Ontario and Quebec.  It has now reached western 
New York and Maine and become a concern in urban 
landscapes and nurseries.   
 
The adult and the larva “skeletonize” leaves by 
feeding on the leaves between the midrib and larger 
veins.  Plants which have been defoliated for 2-3 
consecutive years may be killed.  The preferred host 
is Viburnum opulus and its selections. lesser damage 
is caused to V. lantana and V. rafinesquianum, V. 
dentatum, V. acerifolium, and V. lentago.  Other 
species, particularly V. rhytidophyllum and V. 
carlesii, are relatively unaffected.   
 
The entire life cycle of the viburnum leaf beetle takes 
about 8-10 weeks.  Larvae hatch in early May and 
feed on the viburnum leaves throughout the larval 
period, which lasts 4-5 weeks.  The larvae pupate in 
the soil.  The adults (4.5-6.5 mm long, brown) appear 
by mid-July and continue eating the leaves, then mate 
and lay over-wintering eggs on the twigs.  Egg-laying 
holes are in a straight line on the underside of the 
current season s growth.   
 
Chemical control of the viburnum leaf beetle is best 
applied to young larvae, because adults will fly away 
or drop to the ground if disturbed.  If over-wintering 
egg sites are found, affected wood should be pruned 
and destroyed before the eggs hatch.  Examine upper 
and lower leaf surfaces for feeding larvae.  Potential 
biological control mechanisms are being studied.

Propagation by seed: One can improve seed 
germination by collecting seeds from coyote manure.  
Apparently germination is very high from seeds 
which have passed through the animals  digestive 
systems.  Plant the seeds in the spring in large pots, 
one-quarter inch apart in well-drained, friable soil 
such as a mixture of sand, loam, and peat moss or 
vermiculite and peat moss.  Be patient, as the seeds 
take from four to fifteen weeks to germinate.  At the 
first true leaf stage, plant the seedlings into separate 
one-gallon containers and hold until out-planting.  
Seedlings should be sheltered from winds and major 
temperature changes.  When planting fan palm in a 
permanent location, plant seedlings during the fall, in 
areas exposed to full sunlight.  Fall plantings must be 
watered during the following two summers if rainfall 
is low.

provided abundant fruit that was relished by the 
Cahuilla.  It was eaten fresh or dried in the sun and 
then stored in ollas for future consumption.  The 
seeds and flour were pounded into a meal, mixed 
with other flours and water to a mush.  A beverage 
was made by soaking the fruit in water.  Additionally, 
the leaves were used for clothing, sandals, thatching, 
and basketry materials, the fruit stalks for fire drills,

sprains or applied to sores on the skin.  The roots 
were used to treat gonorrhea and rheumatism.  Skin 
diseases were treated by rubbing the roots on the skin 
and by taking a decoction of the roots.  The plant was 
used as a sedative to induce sleep.  An infusion of the 
plant was used to treat diabetes.  The flowers were 
eaten both raw and cooked.  The pounded roots were 
thrown into fishing waters to “intoxicate fishers” 
allowing for easier catch.  The green leaves are easily 
split into long strips that can be plied into cord.  The 
leaves have long, very strong fibers, a type of sisal, 
which were twisted into strong thread used as 
cordage for binding and to construct baskets, fishing 
nets, fishing lines and clothing.  The leaves of Yucca 
filamentosa contain the strongest fibers native to 
North America.   
 
Wildlife: Hummingbirds visit the flowers.  Yuccas 
are pollinated by small, white Yucca moths 
(Tegeticula yucasella and related species) with which 
they have a special plant-insect mutualism.  At night, 
the fragrant flowers attract the female moth that feeds 
on the nectar.  She then rolls pollen from the flowers 
into a ball that is three times the size of her head and 
carries the pollen ball to the next flower.  There, she 
first lays eggs inside the immature ovary and then 
deposits the pollen on the flower’s stigma insuring 
that seeds will form to feed her progeny.  Because the 
larvae mature before they are able to consume all of 
the seeds (60 to 80% of the seeds remain viable), the 
plants are able to reproduce as well.   
 
Other: The flowers are used for corsages.

well as in areas of high heat and light, such as 
parking lots.  The plants have striking foliage that 
adds interest to borders, rock gardens and xeriscapes.  
The plants are long-lived and very drought resistant.  
The thick, rhizomous roots are storage organs that 
allow the plants to thrive in many soils, even in areas 
of pure sand.  The plants can spread through this 
underground root system to form small clumps (1 to 
1.5 m wide) with multiple crowns or offshoots.  They 
can tolerate both cold and moderate wetness, making 
the species one of the most hardy of the genus.  The 
plants may be propagated by dividing the offshoots 
from the parent plant.  The plants may also be 
propagated through root cuttings and seeds, which 
sprout readily.  Care should be taken in site selection, 
as the roots of mature plants can grow large and 
extend deep into the ground, making removal 
difficult.  For more temporary sites, the plants may be 
grown in containers.  For garden plantings space the 
plants about 1meter apart in a sunny, well-drained 
location of low to medium fertility.  Water the plants 
well for the first year as the roots establish.  Because

by many tribes in southern California including the 
Tubatulabal, Cahuilla, Luiseno, Diegueno, Kawaiisu, 
and Western Shoshone and are still gathered today.   
 
According to the Kawaiisu, traditionally in the early 
spring, the apical meristem or &quot.heart&quot. was removed 
with the aid of an oak or a juniper shaft.  It was then 
roasted in a pit for a lengthy period.  While green and 
tender the flower stalk that grows out of the apical 
meristem was cut or broken off by hand.  These 
stalks were cut into sections and roasted in fire or in 
ashes and coals.  It is reputed to have a sweet taste.  
The flowers are edible and can be boiled and eaten. 
The Diegueno tribe harvested the flowers before they  
opened and boiled them twice to remove the 
bitterness before eating. 
 
Chaparral yucca was also an important fiber plant.  
The Diegueno and Cahuilla used the fibers for 
sandals while the Chumash and the Gabrielino used it 
for fishing line.  Whole or split yucca leaves were 
also utilized for rough tying of bundles of firewood, 
house frames, and for basketry.  To retrieve and 
prepare the fibers, the leaves were immersed in water 
until the epidermal sheath and the connecting round 
tissue rotted away.  The leaves may also have been 
pounded with a wooden mallet to facilitate the 
process.  The fibers are then buried in mud to whiten 
them, washed and combed.  
 
Wildlife: The seeds and fruits are eaten by the 
antelope ground squirrel and hummingbirds consume 
the nectar.

young seedling the following fall outside.  This yucca 
needs full sun, excellent drainage, and is intolerant of 
frequent summer water.  It can endure cold 
temperatures to about 10 degrees F. 
 
Cuttings: Cut off yucca leaves at the point of origin 
in the spring.  Reduce the length of the leaves to six 
inches, exposing bare stem tissue.  Stick the cuttings 
in a pot with well-drained soil and water the soil, 
keeping it slightly moist.  Place the pot in partial

and gonorrhea.  An ointment, made my mixing the 
plant with bear grease, was applied to ulcers and 
sores.  Infusions of the berries were used to spray on 
the chest and throat to treat bronchial diseases, to 
wash sores, and to flavor medicines.  The bark and 
the berries were used to treat hemorrhages, to make 
cough syrup, as an expectorant, and to treat 
tuberculosis.  Children who were weak were washed 
with a decoction of the bark to make their legs and 
feet strong.  The bark was used in different forms to 
alleviate toothaches.  Smoking the bark treated 
toothache.  Bark, either beaten or powdered was 
packed in and around an aching tooth.  Pieces of the 
bark were chewed to help breakup a tooth that was to 
be remove.  The plant was an ingredient in 
compounds that were used for kidney trouble, to 
strengthen convalescing patients, and to induce 
vomiting.  An infusion of the bark was, at least once, 
placed on a dog’s nose to improve its scenting 
capabilities during hunting.  The fruits were 
administered as diuretics to horses.  Young men of 
the Omaha tribe used a perfume made from the fruits.  
The plant is probably still used today for various 
purposes by various Native American tribes. 
 
Wildlife: The fruits are eaten by a variety of birds and 
small mammals including bobwhite quails, vireos, 
pheasants, cottontails, and eastern chipmunks.  Bees 
are attracted to the flowers.  Giant swallowtail 
butterflies lay their eggs on the plants leaves.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_='Uses 
Ethnobotanic: The Seminole, Alabama, and many 
other Native American tribes in the southeastern 
United States used the fruits and roots of coontie for 
food.  Some people still prepare it today.  The starchy 
stems and roots were the main source of flour for the 
Seminoles and many indigenous people of central 
and southern Florida.  These peoples are attributed 
with increasing the plant’s distribution.  The plant 
parts contain central nervous system toxins, which 
must be removed before consumption.  To make 
flour, the roots are first chopped into pieces.  They 
are then pounded with a mortar and pestle.  The pulp 
is then washed with water and the starch is allowed to 
settle to the bottom.  Then the water is drained and 
the remaining paste is left to ferment for several days.  
At the end of the fermentation process, the starch is 
set in the sun to dry.  When dry, the powdery, 
cornmeal-like flour is then baked into bread.

Wildlife:  Coontie cones reportedly provide food in 
exchange for pollination services for two species of 
beetles in Florida, Pharaxonotha zamiae and 
Rhopalotria slossoni.  The seeds are a source of food 
for mockingbirds, blue jays, and many other birds as 
well as insects and small mammals.  Butterfly larvae 
feed on the leaflets.

UPDATE usda_plants SET cs_='Description 
General: Cycad Family (Zamiaceae).  Zamia is one 
of only a few primitive or ‘relict’ genera, commonly 
called cycads that are living remnants of plants that 
were abundant about 325 million years ago.  Zamia 
pumila is the only species of this genus that grows in 
the United States.  Coontie is a fern-like evergreen, 
perennial shrub (.5 to 1 m in height) with a thick (10 
cm in diameter), sometimes branched, trunk that is 
either very short (to 15 cm) or submerged.  The trunk 
is starchy, which is the reason for the name 
“Seminole bread”.  Dark green fronds grow from the 
top of the trunk and have 2 to 13 pairs of stiff, 
leathery leaflets that are 4-9 dm long.  Leaf-widths 
vary among plants.  Fronds are from 40 to 80 cm 
long.  Green to dark reddish brown cones grow atop 
stalks, from the center of the top of the trunk.  Male 
plants bear slender, cylindrical cones that are about 
10 cm long and 2-3 cm in diameter.  The cone-like 
reproductive structures on female plants, called 
“megasporophytes,” are 12 to 13 cm long, 5 cm in 
diameter.  Cones appear in mid-to late summer.  The 
red to red-orange seeds are 1cm to 2 cm long.   
 
Distribution: Z. pumilia is endemic to central and 
southern Florida.  Zamia pumila is now rare, not only 
because of its very small geographic range, but also 
because people dig up plants in the wild to plant in 
their gardens.  For current distribution, please consult 
the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site.
