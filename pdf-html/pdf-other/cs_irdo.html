<br>draw in the loop.  One Indian stated that &quot;it takes 
<br>nearly six weeks to make a rope twelve feet long.&quot;  In 
<br>spite of the tremendous labor of preparing this 
<br>material, the iris fiber was one of the most generally 
<br>employed in northwestern California.  The threads 
<br>and cords of this fiber were used to make fishing 
<br>nets, camping bags and snares for catching deer, 
<br>birds, and other game. 
<br> 
<br>Since iris is fine and can be bent at sharp angles, it 
<br>makes an excellent starting knot in coiled baskets.  It 
<br>is said that babies were wrapped in the soft green 
<br>leaves of </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Iris douglasiana</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> while their mothers 
<br>collected manzanita berries, to keep the babies cool 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">and to prevent dehydration.  
<br> 
<br>The Monache and the Southern Yokuts in California 
<br>make flour from iris seed.  The Pomo placed acorn 
<br>meal in a shallow pit and covered the meal with Iris 
<br>leaves before pouring water over the meal to leach 
<br>out tannic acid.  
<br> 
<br>A poultice of the raw rhizome is especially effective 
<br>against staph sores.  Externally, iris is successfully 
<br>used in infected wounds, ulcers, and fistulas, plus to 
<br>take away freckles.  Only the dry root should be used 
<br>internally.  Iris is active as a cathartic, has a 
<br>stimulating effect on the production of both 
<br>pancreatic enzymes and bile, is a strong diuretic, and 
<br>will stimulate both saliva and sweat.  This is a useful 
<br>medicinal plant, but in general should be used with 
<br>care and preferably in combinations where less 
<br>energetic plants form the bulk of a medicinal 
<br>formula.  
<br> 
<br>Tea from iris roots was used for kidney trouble by 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">several California Indian peoples (Murphey 1959).  
<br>The Yana chewed iris roots to cure coughs.  The 
<br>Modoc used an iris root decoction to soothe sore 
<br>eyes. A piece of iris root was inserted in a tooth 
<br>cavity to kill the nerve, so the tooth will come out.  
<br>Tests showed slight bactericidal effects, slight effects 
<br>on rabbit pneumonia, and an ascorbic acid content of 
<br>4% (Archer 1957).  Roots were burned and the 
<br>smoke inhaled to alleviate dizziness.  A root 
<br>decoction was used as a cathartic and emetic, but 
<br>large doses could cause severe digestive problems.

<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Ethnobotanical</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">: Iris makes some of the finest 
<br>cordage; the fibers are particularly strong and 
<br>flexible.  Only two fibers can be taken from each iris 
<br>leaf margin.  Huge bunches of leaves were harvested 
<br>in the fall and stored until needed.  Iris cordage was 
<br>used for fishing nets, string, rope, snares, hairnets, 
<br>and regalia. The fibers are fine like silk, but 
<br>surprisingly strong.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Rope was made from fibers, which occur, on the 
<br>outside of iris leaves.  The iris leaves were gathered 
<br>in large bundles and a single silky fiber was taken 
<br>from each margin of the leaf. None of the other fibers 
<br>was used.  Using a mussel-shell or abalone 
<br>&quot;thumbnail&quot; the women stripped the fibers from the 
<br>leaves.  The fibers are detached from the leaves and 
<br>scraped clean of all tissues.  The men, mostly while 
<br>sitting around in their sweathouses twisted the 
<br>threads on the bare thigh. The men always knotted 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">the fishing nets.  A deer rope is near 20 feet long with

<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">General</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">: Iris Family (Iridaceae).  The native irises 
<br>are perennial herbs, usually evergreen and growing 
<br>from a creeping, tuberous rhizome.  Irises can be 
<br>identified by their double row of leaves, which 
<br>overlap like praying hands.  The leaves are long and 
<br>linear with parallel venation. Flower stems are erect 
<br>and simple.  Blossoms vary somewhat in spacing of 
<br>the parts, width of sepals, and the inner, erect 
<br>standards (petals).  </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Iris douglasiana</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> has pale cream to 
<br>light, dark lavender or deep reddish purple flowers

<br>Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
<br>site.  </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Iris douglasiana</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> grows abundantly along the 
<br>coast from north Santa Barbara County, California, 
<br>into Oregon.  It is found in shade with moist soils 
<br>with ample organic matter. This plant is common in 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">grassy places, especially near the coast, at elevations 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">generally less than 100 m.  It grows naturally in the 
<br>coastal prairie and mixed evergreen forest 
<br>communities. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Establishment 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">The native irises are excellent in shade situations, 
<br>even dense shade of walls and fences (Schmidt 
<br>1980).  They will tolerate sun for most of the day in 
<br>mild areas, and should have afternoon shade and 
<br>ample water in the interior regions.  Plants may be 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">watered the year round.  Fertilization increases 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">biomass and seed production. This iris has a 
<br>clumping rhizome system, and is readily propagated 
<br>by plant division in fall or winter.

<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:324px; top:962px; width:217px; height:645px;"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">When allowed to increase freely, plants will 
<br>naturalize and eventually form extensive ground 
<br>cover.  Unless the seed vessels are removed there will 
<br>be many volunteer plants, but if inferior flower size 
<br>or color appears it should be culled immediately.  
<br>Irises start growing with the first cool weather and 
<br>rains in fall, reaching the height of their growth in 
<br>spring and early summer.  They go dormant after 
<br>seed set, in hot dry summer.  
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Propagation by Plant Division</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">: </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Iris douglasiana</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> is 
<br>clonal, radiating outward in growth from the center.  
<br>The best propagation method for these is division, in 
<br>fall or winter after the first new roots are established 
<br>but before the flowers form.  
<br> 
<br>Native irises in the wild tend to produce only a small, 
<br>dry rhizome with stringy roots, which is difficult to 
<br>dig.  Vigorous garden or greenhouse plants produce 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">firm, white, growing roots especially in winter and 
<br>spring growing seasons, and clumps are easily 
<br>divided at those time.  Remove a new fan with fleshy 
<br>roots set in a prepared site, water it, and provide 
<br>shade for a few days if the plant is placed in full sun.  
<br>Frequent division appears to keep the plants 
<br>vigorous, as well as being the best method of 
<br>increasing the supply of superior forms. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Propagation by Seed</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">: Iris seed is easily collected 
<br>from the large capsules.  The capsules turn from 
<br>green to brown and open at the top when they are 
<br>ripe.  They have to be watched closely, because they 
<br>disperse rapidly.  Two days after ripening, the seed is 
<br>gone.  Collect capsules carefully to avoid spilling 
<br>seeds.  Each capsule has from 20 to 80 seeds. 
<br> 
<br>Seeds should be stored in paper envelopes at room 
<br>temperature until they are planted. The seeds of all 
<br>species will keep up to 10 years at room temperature. 
<br> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">Plant seeds in 6-inch pots, using a combination of 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">leaf mold and peat moss.  Cover seeds with 1/2 inch 
<br>of same material.  Any good potting soil that's acidic 
<br>is good for seed germination. 
<br> 
<br>After planting, over-winter the pots outdoors in 
<br>November or December.  They will come up in 2-3 
<br>months, depending on the weather.  Germination 
<br>increases the second year, because there's always a 
<br>percentage of hard seeds that won't germinate the 
<br>first year.  Part of the seed waits for the next year, to 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">increase the probability for good weather conditions 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">and optimize germination success. 
<br> 
<br>Plant the seedlings in May, when the young plants 
<br>are usually 3 to 6 inches tall or even taller.  Plant

<br>desired, scatter and clump the plantings.  Water 
<br>plants through the dry season until the roots have 
<br>established. After the first year the plants should be 
<br>self-maintaining without additional watering, unless 
<br>there is an unusually hot, dry spell.  Plants will begin 
<br>to bloom by their second  year if growth has been 
<br>continuous. 
<br> 
<br>Direct seeding is possible in places that can be left 
<br>undisturbed, as among shrubs, or among low 
<br>perennials where the seedlings can be sheltered.  If 
<br>planting seeds in the ground, autumn is the best time 
<br>for seeding; germination begins in two or three 
<br>months and often continues beyond that time.  A 
<br>friable seed mixture of sand, loam, and either peat or 
<br>screened leaf mold is best, covering the seed with 
<br>sphagnum moss to aid in preventing damping-off of 
<br>seedlings. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size:13px">Management 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">In autumn old leaves should be removed from the 
<br>center of large clumps, the foliage cut back, and a 
<br>mulch applied, especially if the irises are being 
<br>naturalized in a semi-dry area. Traditional resource 
<br>management included harvesting huge bunches of iris 
<br>leaves in the fall, and storing these leaves until 
<br>needed.  The fibers are then harvested from the 
<br>leaves. This naturally accomplished the pruning and 
<br>mulching that modern horticulturists practice to 
<br>maintain iris beds. 
<br> 
<br>The PCI Borer (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Amphipoea americana</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> var. </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">pacifica </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">) 
<br>and Iris Borer are serious pests of iris.  The Iris Borer 
<br>stays in the rhizome through the winter, then 
<br>metamorphoses, coming out in the spring as a 
<br>nocturnal moth. Controlling the moth when its flying, 
<br>to prevent it from laying its eggs on the iris, would 
<br>control the borer.  The UC Botanical Garden used the 
<br>biological control </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Bacillus thuringienis</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">, but it didn't 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">help.  At this time, it is recommended to dig the 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">infected plant out entirely, put it a plastic bag, and 
<br>put them in the garbage can to avoid contamination 
<br>of other plants.

<br>Milkweed (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Asclepias</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px"> species) and dogbane 
<br>(</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size:13px">Apocynum cannibinum </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">) were traditionally burned 
<br>by native people in the fall to maintain vigorous plant 
<br>production, to stimulate plant growth, to optimize 
<br>long and abundant fiber production from leaves and 
<br>stalks, and to stimulate seed production.  It is 
<br></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:13px">probable that iris was burned for the same reasons.
