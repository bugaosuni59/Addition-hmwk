UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_Establishment='White fir may be regenerated by natural seeding, 
direct seeded, or planted.  Cones begin to disintegrate 
and shed seeds in late September or early October, 
and there is a good seed crop about every 2 to 5 
years.  The seed germinates in the spring but usually 
less than 50 percent of the seed germinate.  White fir 
is generally rated as tolerant to very tolerant of shade 
so that selective (partial) cutting tends to favor this 
species.  Initial growth rate is usually very slow up to 
about 30 years, then growth accelerates markedly.  In 
planting white fir 2 to 4 year old stock is 
recommended.  In direct seeding 10 to 15 seeds per 
spot is recommended.  To ensure adequate stocking 
of natural seedings, clear cutting strips 130 to 200 
feet wide or patches up to 250 feet across the largest 
dimension is recommended.  At least 10 seed trees

On better sites fully stocked, unmanaged stands of 
white fir may yield up to 150,000 board feet per acre 
at age 100.  Thinning white fir stands periodically 
will salvage trees which would be lost to natural 
mortality.  Pruning is not ordinarily recommended for 
white fir because of its tendency for epicormic 
sprouting and unless the tree is being grown for 
veneer or finish lumber, there is not need for this 
practice. 
 
Young trees are easily killed by fire and must be 
protected from this hazard.  Young sapling and pole 
sized trees are subject to sunscald when exposed 
suddenly, and thinnings should be light because of 
this.  White fir is more prone to windthrow than 
ponderosa pine because of its more shallow, wide 
spreading root system, and care should be taken in 
partial cuttings to leave buffer strips against the wind 
and to thin conservatively. 
 
White fir Christmas trees require 6 to 9 years to 
produce a 6 foot tree.  They need cultivation or other 
treatment to prevent excessive competition from 
grass.  Excessive leader growth will need to be 
controlled by basal pruning, basal scarring or pruning 
of the terminal shoot.  Leader growth should be kept 
to about 12 inches.

Alternate Names  
Pelotazo, sweet Indian mallow, Indian mallow  
  
Uses  
Texas Indian mallow a native perennial subshrub forb 
grows in dry areas on cliffs, slopes, limestone outcrops, 
prairies and in open woods and chaparral.  Plants are 
browsed by deer, sheep and goats and are quickly 
eliminated from grazed rangelands.  Seeds are eaten by 
bobwhite quail and mourning doves, and the plants 
provide cover for wildlife.  It has potential to enhance 
water quality and improve range condition with proper 
management.  Indian mallow is drought-tolerant and 
suitable for xeriscaping.  The conspicuous flower attracts 
birds, butterflies and larval plant food for several species 
of skipper butterflies.   
  
Status  
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g. threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values).  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
Description and Adaptation  
Mallow Family (Malvaceae).  Texas Indian mallow an 
upright warm-season, hairy perennial subshrub forb 
reaches .3 to 1.8 meters (1 to 6 feet) , more commonly .6 
to .9 meters (2 to 3 feet high), the stem unbranched to 
much branched.  Leaves 10 centimeters (4 inches) long, 
alternate, short-stalked. blade thickish, gray in color with 
fine, star-shaped hairs, heart-shaped at base, sharply 
pointed at tip, the margins irregularly toothed.  Upper 
leaves much smaller.  Flowers are conspicuous at 1.9 to 
2.54 centimeters (¾ to 1 inch) across. 5 petals, pale 
orange-yellow. stamens numerous. blooms from June to 
October. 5 to 9 hairy carpels, two or more seeds in each 
carpel.  Found in dry, mostly calcareous soils of prairies, 
chaparral and in open woodlands, and on rocky cliffs and 
slopes from Arkansas, Oklahoma to Texas.

Establishment  
Texas Indian mallow should be seeded early in the spring, 
either by broadcasting or with a grass drill equipped with 
a small seed box.  For best result seeds no deeper than ¼ 
to ½ inch on a firm well prepared seedbed using some 
type of carrier, such as sand, to enhance seed distribution.  
Texas Indian mallow could be a valuable component if 
included in a grass/forb mix for pasture and rangeland.    
  
Seed production of Texas Indian mallow is achieved at 
the NRCS James E. “Bud” Smith Plant Materials Center 
in Knox City, Texas by seeding at a rate of 2.0 Pure Live 
Seed (PLS) pound per acre.  The Plant Materials Center 
seeds in the spring after the last frost with a two row 
cotton planter equipped with a Planet Jr. planter 
attachment.

Management  
Texas Indian mallow will require grazing management to 
maintain plant vigor and persistence.  Plants have 
reported to prefer full or part sun exposure and not full 
shade.  If used for landscaping remove the previous years’ 
growth prior to spring growth. 
 
Pests and Potential Problems  
During evaluation and subsequent seed production at the 
James E. “Bud“ Smith Plant Materials Center near Knox 
City, Texas, no serious pests or diseases were observed.  
  
Environmental Concerns  
Texas Indian mallow does not pose any known negative 
concerns to the environment.     
  
Seeds and Plant Production  
Seed can be harvested with a standard combine and run 
through a hammer mill then cleaned with a fanning mill.  
Seed of Texas Indian mallow is small with 136,900 seeds 
per pound.     
  
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin)  
There are currently no cultivars of Texas Indian mallow 
in seed commercial industry.

intake and weight reduction. All rabbits consuming 
prairie acacia showed central nervous system 
disturbances. Researchers, in Stephenville, Texas, 
compared 15 native perennial herbaceous legumes 
for herbage production, crude protein percentage, and 
laboratory measurements of digestibility. Prairie 
acacia exhibited high, compared to the other species, 
herbage yield and crude protein percentage. The 
laboratory measurements suggested that prairie 
acacia is more digestible to livestock than other 
species tested  
 
Restoration: Prairie acacia is a hardy and drought 
tolerant plant that is useful for revegetation of land 
disturbed by mining or road construction.  
 
Wildlife: Prairie acacia is browsed by white-tail deer. 
It is a prolific seed producer. Quail and other birds 
will utilize the seed for food and the vegetation 
provides cover for small animals and wild birds.

Koa is the largest native Hawaiian tree.  It typically 
attains heights of 15-25 m (50-80 ft) with a canopy 
spread of 6-12 m (20-40 ft).  Found between 100-
2300 m (330-7500 ft).  The form of trees ranges from 
an upright single trunk to low and sprawling with 
multiple trunks.  Pale yellow flowers are borne in 
axillary racemes with spherical heads about 8.5 mm 
(0.33 in) in diameter.  Flowers are produced 
throughout the year, peaking in mid to late winter.  
Seeds are contained within a pod (legume) 15-20 cm 
(6-8 in) long containing 6-12 seeds.  There are three 
varieties of Acacia koa.  A.koa var. koa, A.koa var. 
latifolia, and A. koa var. kauaiensis. 
 
Distribution: Endemic to the Hawaiian Islands.  
Please consult the Plant Profile page for this species 
on the PLANTS Web site. 
 
' WHERE symbol='acko';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD fs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_Establishment='The only propagation method currently in wide use is 
from seed.  Pods are ready to pick when their color 
has turned from green to brown or black.  Growing 
koa seedlings is very similar to many other nitrogen-
fixing tree species, requiring pre-germination 
treatment (scarification) to break through the hard, 
impermeable seed coat, inoculation with appropriate 
rhizobia bacteria, and special nutrient requirements.  
Trees should be inoculated in the nursery within 4 
weeks of germination.     
 
Koa requires well-drained soils.  Koa stands on 
shallow soils are not as productive as those on deep 
soils and may be short-lived.  Koa is difficult to 
integrate with annual crops due to koa’s aggressive 
surface root system that competes with crops, while 
also susceptible to damage by human, animal, and 
machine traffic.   
 
Hawai‘i’s highly variable climate means that 
matching an appropriate seed source to the site 
conditions is important to foster a viable koa 
planting.  Environmental tolerances of koa vary by 
population.  Such variation is one reason that 
seedlings used in reforestation should come from 
seeds collected from sites near or similar to the 
planting site.  Koa trees grow well only in the sun.

After an overnight frost, young seedlings may be

Overwatering and over-fertilization cause stress 
which often exhibits itself as yellowing of the leaves.  
Decreasing irrigation and eliminating nitrogen 
fertilizer can reverse the problem.  Weed whacking 
the bark at the base of the tree can ruin the tree in a 
fraction of a second.  It’s best to control weeds only 
by hand cutting and mulching near the tree.  Leave a 
few inches of space against the trunk when mulching 
to reduce rotting.  Root-bound seedlings that have 
become stunted in their containers will never return 
to being vigorous, healthy trees and should be 
discarded.   
 
Without adequate soil contact, newly planted 
seedlings can be severely set back or die within a few 
days of planting.  When planting seedlings, especially 
those grown in forestry tubes, the soil should be 
firmed up against the seedling’s root system.  Windy 
or shady conditions are not conducive to rapid 
growth.  Trees should be protected from wind and 
given full sun most of the day.  When planting dense 
stands of koa, failure to thin trees will cause growth 
to stagnate.  The planting area must be fenced to 
exclude any grazing animals and competitive 
vegetation should be removed around planting holes. 
 
In urban situations, mulching with leafy materials is 
recommended to suppress weeds, conserve moisture, 
and protect koa’s surface roots.  Pruning is not 
recommended since cuts provide easy access to fungi 
and borers.

seedlings.  Livestock readily consume small 
seedlings and can quickly cause catastrophic damage 
to young trees.  Seed predators include seed weevils 
and the koa seed worm.  The koa moth may cause

slopes and rocky outcrops with impoverished or 
weakly developed soils.  In drier and nearly semi-arid 
regions of the western US, the species can be used for 
rangeland plantings as a component of seed mixtures.   
 
Lemmon s needlegrass is a valuable forage plant and

grass with culms (stems) that are 20-80 cm tall and 
hairy below the nodes (joints).  Leaf blades are 10-20 
cm long, 1-2 mm wide, flat or rolled inward, and 
often blue-green in color.  The form is spreading to 
upright and the inflorescence (seed head or panicle) 
is spike-like, narrow, and pale or purplish in color. 
Spikelets are one flowered.  The subspecies 
pubescens has pubescent or tomentose culms.  
Lemmon s needlegrass flowers in May and seeds 
mature by mid June in the foothills of western 
Oregon. 
 
Key to Identification: Lemmon s needlegrass has a 
distinct spike-like seed head and long awns (linear 
appendages that are 15-50 mm but typically 20-35 
mm) on the seed that are bent twice and twisted at 
maturity.  The species can easily be confused with 
other grasses in the genus Stipa or Achnatherum.  
However, other needlegrasses are less likely to occur 
at low elevations west of the Cascades from the 
Willamette Valley northward.  Western needlegrass 
(Stipa occidentalis) can co-exist at mid-elevations but 
its seed is much smaller than Lemmon s needlegrass.  
Without seed heads the fine textured bluish foliage of 
Lemmon’s needlegrass may be confused with 
Roemer’s fescue (Festuca roemeri) which has a 
broader, branching panicle.

southern British Columbia and east to Montana, 
Utah, and Arizona.  The species has deep fibrous 
roots and is very drought tolerant.  Stands typically 
occur on dry sunny slopes, grasslands, savannas, 
openings within pine woodlands, and upland prairies 
from sea-level to 7500 ft. elevation.  It is adapted to 
low fertility and moderately acid to slightly alkaline 
(pH 5.0-7.5), shallow soils derived from basalts.   
Soil texture ranges from gravelly to medium fine 
loams and silts.  The subspecies pubescens is 
restricted to serpentine soils (soils high in silicates of 
magnesium and iron as well as other minerals and 
therefore toxic to many plants).

removed by a debearder or other device in order to 
plant using standard seeding equipment.  
Germination for most seed lots improves 
substantially with 60-90 days of cold, moist chilling 
(stratification).  Therefore, direct seeding should be 
in the fall to overcome dormancy.  In some cases, 
light scarification of the seed coat has improved 
germination as well.  There are approximately 95,000 
seeds/lb (+/- 15%) with awns removed but hulls 
intact.  One pound of live seed sown per acre is 
equivalent to about 2.2 live seeds per square foot.  
For best results and easier management, sow alone at 
4-8 lbs/ac or at lower rates in mixes with other 
species that have similar seed dormancy.  Where 
winters are relatively mild and snow free, seed may 
germinate outdoors as early as January.  Control of 
fall and winter weeds is essential for initial stand 
establishment, otherwise results can be poor.  Good 
results can be achieved with the use of a nonselective 
foliar applied herbicide after sowing but prior to 
emergence of Lemmon’s needlegrass.  The species 
tolerates light to moderate grazing and fire as natural 
components of prairie ecosystems.

midwestern forests.  Also called river maple, this 
name derives from the common occurrence of the 
species along our river systems.  Silver maple shares 
many of its sites with red maple, but the two species 
are easily distinguished.  Silver maple is typically a 
much larger tree with a much larger fruit (called a 
samara), but the two species are the only native 
maples with spring seed dispersal.  The leaves of 
silver maple are often larger and more deeply 
fissured between lobes than those of red maple.  
Silver maple can grow 3-7 feet per year.

well with other plants, although grass and weed 
control will improve survival and allow for even 
better growth.  The seed germinates rapidly, and 
streambanks underneath mature trees are often 
covered with seedlings shortly after seed dispersal in 
the late spring, especially along the waterline.  The 
rapid growth means that seedlings are almost always 
out-planted as 1-0 stock.

much preferred to box elder in any planting. 
Wildlife: Silver maple is not notable for its 
attractiveness to wildlife, but as a source of fast 
shading, large woody debris, and litter in streams the 
species has few rivals.  It seems to be a preferred 
nesting species for Baltimore orioles.

Uses: 
Achyranthes  splendens  has  the  potential  for  ecosystem 
restoration,  re-vegetation  of  degraded  habitats,  and  to 
increase diversity in dry-land and coastal communities.   
Its silvery appearance makes it an excellent selection for 
xeriscape gardens and other dryland landscaping projects.

status  (e.g.,  threatened  or  endangered  species,  state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
Achyranthes splendens var. rotunda is listed by the U.S. 
Federal Government as an Endangered Species. 
 
Description and Adaptation 
Achyranthes  splendens  is  a  small  shrub  2  to  6  feet  in 
height. The leaves are arranged opposite and are obovate 
to broadly elliptic or suborbicular in shape, ranging in size 
from ¾ to 4 ½ inches long and ½ to 2 ½ inches wide. The 
leaves are also covered with white hairs, especially on the 
lower  surface  giving  them  a  silvery  appearance.    Its 
flower  is  a  densely-congested  spike  with  a  silvery 
appearance as well and can measure from 1 to 9 ½ inches 
long. 
 
Achyranthes  splendens  is  an  endemic  shrub.  It  occurs 
naturally  at  low  elevations,  generally  from  sea  level  to 
100  feet,  in  open,  dry  areas.    It  is  known  to  survive 
plantings up to 1000 feet.  It is currently known to occur 
naturally  along  the  western  coast  of  Oahu,  on  the 
Kalaupapa  peninsula  on  Molokai,  near  Manele  and 
Maunalei Gulch on  Lanai, in West Maui, and near Kula 
on  East  Maui.  There  are  2  varieties  recognized  in  The 
Manual  of  the  Flowering  Plants  of  Hawaii  (Wagner 
1990). A. splendens var. rotundata, and A. splendens var. 
splendens.

Establishment 
Achyranthes  splendens  will  propagate  easily  either  by 
seed or by vegetative cuttings.  Dibble tubes and a sterile 
planting medium with good drainage are recommended to 
start  propagules.    Cuttings  should  be  started  under  50% 
shade.  Seeds should be started in full sunlight and should 
germinate within 7-10 days.    Out-plant A. splendens in 
areas  where  it  can  enjoy  full  sunlight.  A.  splendens  will 
tolerate low fertility soils, but soil amendments based on 
soil  tests  will  benefit  any  planting.  When  out-planting 
seedlings,  moderate  moisture  should  be  provided  until 
plants  become  established.    This  could  take  at  least  1-2 
months. 
 
Management 
Achyranthes  splendens  is  well  adapted  to  low  rainfall 
areas and requires very little moisture, if any, once it has 
become established.  A. splendens  will  thrive  with  no to 
very little soil amendments.  It tolerates pruning and will 
recover easily from the occasional broken branch.  There 
have  been  instances  at  the  Hoolehua  PMC  where  the 
major stem had broken off and the remaining stump had 
re-grown completely. 
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
There are no known pests or potential problems. 
 
Environmental Concerns 
Achyranthes  splendens  is  primarily  threatened  by  urban 
development.  Other threats include invasive alien plants, 
wildfires, introduced deer and cattle ranching. 
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
None.

commonly recommended for forage production.  It is 
palatable to livestock and wildlife and is a desirable 
feed in spring, and in the fall if it re-grows enough.  It 
is used for cattle and horse winter forage, but protein 
supplements are required to ensure good animal 
health.  It withstands heavy grazing pressure (65% 
use and greater) once stands are established.  The 
best forage types in order are Siberian, desertorum, 
and Hycrest. 
 
 
Erosion control/reclamation: Crested wheatgrasses 
are useful for soil stabilization.  They compete well 
with other aggressive introduced grasses, but because 
of this trait, they are not compatible in mixes with 
native species.  Their drought tolerance, fibrous root 
systems, and good seedling vigor make these species 
ideal for reclamation in areas with 8 to 20 inches 
annual precipitation.  These grasses can be used in 
urban areas where irrigation water is limited to 
provide ground cover and to stabilize ditchbanks, 
dikes, pipelines, powerlines and roadsides. 
Wildlife: Birds and small rodents eat crested 
wheatgrass seeds. deer, antelope and elk graze it, 
especially in spring and fall. Upland and song birds 
utilize stands for nesting.

elevation.  Crested wheatgrass does well on shallow 
to deep, moderately course to fine textured, 
moderately well to well drained and weakly acidic to 
moderately alkaline soils.  Under saline conditions, 
vigor and production are reduced.  Siberian types are 
well adapted to light, droughty soils.   
All crested wheatgrasses are cold tolerant, can 
withstand moderate periodic flooding in the spring,

long periods of inundation, poorly drained soils or 
excessive irrigation.

fall on medium to light textured soils.  Late summer 
(August - mid September) seedings are not 
recommended unless irrigation is available.  Crested

Crested wheatgrasses produce leaves in the spring 
about 10 days after bluegrass species and about 2 to 3 
weeks earlier than native wheatgrasses.  New stands 
of crested wheatgrass should not be grazed until they 
 
 
are firmly established and have started to produce 
seed heads.  Six inches of new growth should be 
attained in spring before grazing is allowed in 
established stands.  Three inches of stubble should 
remain at the end of the grazing season to maintain 
the long term health of the plant. 
Crested wheatgrasses are low maintenance plants. 
however, spring/fall deferment or grazing rotations 
are recommended to maintain plant health and to 
maximize forage production potential.  Crested 
wheatgrass can be used for hay production and will 
make nutritious feed, but is more suited to pasture 
use.  Light, infrequent applications of nitrogen (25 
pounds/acre) and irrigation will increase total 
biomass production and lengthen the green period.

restoration habitat. Preliminary observation found that 
purple giant hyssop attracted 14 different species of 
Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera in Cape May, New Jersey. 
The halictid bee (Agapostemon virescens), leaf-cutter bee

auricomus), and Bombus pensylvanicus. The flower also 
attracts goldfinches and hummingbirds.  
 
Ornamental  
Purple giant hyssop is a popular ornamental plant. The 
relatively large height of the plant makes it a good choice 
as a background against fencing.  
 
Status  
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
 
Description and Adaptation 
Description: Purple giant hyssop is a late-flowering, 
native perennial herb of the mint family. It can grow 
unusually tall for a mint. up to 6 feet, with diamond-
shaped stems, aromatic foliage and flowers, and vigorous 
stolons. The stems are erect and form clumps. The upper 
braches may be purplish. 
The densely branched inflorescence is a 1–6 in terminal, 
continuous, or interrupted flower spike, or raceme. The 
plant usually has several spikes. The tops of the spikes 
develop into a flower and two lateral branches develop 
under the flower from a common node. giving the 
inflorescence a symmetrical appearance. The flower 
clusters persist throughout the winter. 
The individual flowers are ¼ in long, 15-nerved tubes that 
are lavender to pale pink. The upper lip has 2 lobes and 
projects forward. and the lower lip curves downwards 
with 3 lobes. The individual lobes are 3-nerved.  
Not all flowers open at the same time. The flowers 
contain 4 stamens that extend beyond the flower. The two 
lower stamens curve upwards, while the two upper 
stamens curve downwards. The pollen sacs are nearly 
parallel. 
A. scrophulariifolia is similar to blue giant hyssop (A. 
foeniculum), however purple giant hyssop has a cup-like 
whorl of green sepals (modified leaf-like bracts under the 
flower) while A. foeniculum has blue-violet sepals. Often 
the sepals of giant purple hyssop have colored margins. 
Nutlets are .05-.07 in (1.5–2 mm), dark brown, rounded, 
and minutely hairy at the squared-off tip.  
The stalked leaves of purple giant hyssop are positioned 
opposite on either side of the stem. The sharp-pointed 
leaves are 4 in long and 2 in wide, with a cordate, 
somewhat heart-shaped or rounded base. The margins of 
the leaves are coarsely toothed and short hairs cover the 
leaf stems. The undersides of the leaves are green, and

smooth or appear shaggy. Conversely, the underside of 
the blue giant hyssop (A. foeniculum) is whitish. The 
species name is derived from the Scrophulariaceae or 
figwort family, for the resemblance of the leaves to the 
figwort. When crushed, the leaves emit a distinct, anise-
like odor. 
height before transplanting. There are 60,000–93,000 
seeds/ounce. 
 
Management 
Because purple giant hyssop requires soil disturbance for 
successful establishment, regular clearings must be 
created and maintained through tree-thinning, elimination 
of competing vegetation, or by delaying natural 
succession cycles.  
 
Populations of purple giant hyssop tend to be short-lived 
because they are easily out-competed. Therefore, field 
plots may need to be re-established every 3–4 years for a 
fuller look. To encourage more vigorous growth, cut 2–6 
in from the plant. 
 
Pests and Potential Problems  
Little is known about potential pests. Anecdotal evidence 
suggests it can be affected by mildew and rusts. There are 
mixed findings on the plant’s susceptibility to browsing 
deer. 
 
The gradual and continued loss of farmland to either 
forests or urbanization continues to threaten a species that 
requires open fields and meadows for habitat.

Purple giant hyssop distribution from USDA-NRCS PLANTS Database. 
 
Adaptation: Like many members of the mint family, 
purple giant hyssop grows best in moist soil or wet 
conditions. It is found in rich woodland sites with dappled 
shade, woodland borders, meadows, thickets, the upper 
limits of floodplains, and upland woods. It prefers 
recently disturbed, sandier soils where competition is 
limited. Plants will not persist under hot and dry 
conditions (USDA zone 9 or higher). Threats to its habitat 
include changes in land use, competition from non-native 
species, and natural succession. For updated distribution, 
please consult the Plant Profile page for this species on 
the PLANTS Web site. 
 
Es tablishment 
Purple giant hyssop requires cold stratification and 
sunlight to germinate. Keep the seed for 8 weeks at 40ºF 
and move to 68ºF for germination. The seeds will 
germinate in 30–90 days in containers with good 
drainage.  When planting in the fall, cold stratification is 
not required. For vegetative propagation, take late spring 
cuttings from the basal growth that emerges in mid-
March. These cuttings can be fertilized for quicker 
establishment. 
 
Purple giant hyssop propagates rapidly by seed and 
transplants easy into natural settings. One can use it in 
dry-site seed mixes for pollinator habitat at 8% of the 
mix. Sow into open ground and cover with a light layer of 
mulch or sow into flats and grow to 12 in (30 cm) in

Desert madwort is an herbaceous annual native to Africa, 
Asia, and Europe.  Stems are erect, ascending, or 
decumbent, often several growing from the base two to 11 
inches tall.  Leaves are alternately arranged on the stem, 
linear in shape or broadest at the tip, tapering to a petiole-
like base (sub-sessile), the tip sharply pointed, and 0.2 to 
1 inch long by 0.04 to 0.12 inch wide.  The entire plant 
except the fruit is covered with 8- to 20-rayed stellate 
hairs (trichomes) giving the plant a pale to grayish 
appearance (canescent).  The inflorescent grows up to 
four inches in length with 30 to 40 flowers on stout, strait, 
ascending pedicels 0.06 to 0.12 inch long.  The flowers 
form from the bottom up as the inflorescence grows.  
Flowers are small, less than a tenth of an inch wide, with 
four pale yellow or dull-whitish, blunt- or notch-tipped 
petals that are widest at the tip and early deciduous.  The 
fruiting pods (silicles) are 0.1 to 0.16 inch in diameter, 
circular in outline with a shallow notch at the tip where 
the short style persists, uniformly inflated at the middle 
and broadly flattened at the margins.  There are two 
chambers in the pod each capable of producing two seeds.  
The chambers are separated by a thin membrane that 
persists and is obvious on the dried, senescent plant.  The 
seeds are egg-shaped in outline, slightly compressed and 
vary narrowly winged at the margins, brown, and 0.06 
inches long.  Plants flower and fruit from April to July in 
North America.  The chromosome number is 2n = 32. 
Similar to its native range, desert madwort grows in 
deserts, rocky areas, disturbed sites, along roadsides, in 
fields, meadows, and sagebrush flats in North America 
from 2,600 to 6,500 feet above sea level.  In the Tianshan 
Mountains of central Asia, desert madwort has similar 
ecological requirements and habitats with mouseear cress

smooth alder is more densely branched and produces 
more seed.  Alders produce nitrogen for themselves 
by the activity of nitrogen-fixing bacteria located in 
root nodules. For this reason, it is not recommended

add to water quality problems.  Smooth alder has 
about 400,000 seeds per pound.

Database 
 
Alternate names  
Synonyms include Alnus sinuata, Alnus sitchensis, 
and Alnus crispa subsp. sinuata.  Other names 
include green alder, mountain alder, slide alder, and 
wavy-leaf alder.  
  
Uses  
Sitka alder is a valuable species for stabilizing 
drastically disturbed, nutrient poor sites such as 
eroded streambanks, landslide chutes, steep rocky 
slopes, areas of flood deposition and scour, and 
exposed mineral soils following glacial retreat, 
avalanches, and massive soil slumping.  It is also 
suitable for reclaiming acid, coal, and copper mine 
spoils and other soil enriching, revegetation efforts 
where a nitrogen fixing shrub (via bacteria in its root 
nodules) is desired.  At the proper densities, the 
species may also be useful in improving forest site 
productivity as a companion or nurse shrub in young 
conifer plantations.    
  
The palatability of Sitka alder is considered poor and 
forage value low for most ungulates, but others 
report that it is one of the most palatable of the 
native alders, especially for sheep. Moose, elk, and 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
certain deer will browse young shoots, leaves, or 
twigs, as will rabbits, snowshoe hares, and squirrels. 
The seeds, buds, or catkins are an important source 
of food in winter for numerous song and game birds. 
Beavers eat the bark and use the stems to build 
lodges and dams. Thickets provide thermal and 
hiding cover for big game and other wildlife, as well 
as nesting habitat for many small birds.  
  
Native Americans used the bark and its extracts to 
make a red-brown dye, cure several internal 
ailments, and treat skin wounds, itching, and 
swelling, including poison oak.  Leaves and roots 
were used medicinally as well. The wood was 
preferred by some tribes for smoking salmon, 
woodworking, and making bows, baskets, and 
snowshoes.  
  
Description  
Sitka alder is a deciduous shrub or small tree that 
grows to height of 3 to 20 ft, occasionally taller.  
The form is upright, multi-stemmed, and freely 
branching at the base with a rounded crown. Male 
flowers are in the form of long catkins that begin 
opening in late winter. Found separately on the same 
plant are the female flowers which are cone-like 
(short catkins called strobiles) and bloom in early 
spring when the leaves appear. The seeds are winged 
nutlets that mature in autumn or early winter within 
the egg shaped woody cones.  The leaves are broadly 
oval, 1 to 5 in. long, shiny above, wavy and finely 
toothed on the margins, and slightly scented and 
sticky beneath when young.  Nodules containing 
nitrogen fixing bacteria form on the strong fibrous 
roots.  The bark is smooth and grey. Twigs form a 
zigzag branch pattern.    
  
Status  
Please consult the Plants Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s 
current status, such as state noxious and wetland 
indicator values.  
  
Adaptation  
Sitka alder is a pioneer species that prefers full sun 
to partial shade and soils that range from mineral to 
rich, humus covered substrates, acid to neutral pH 
(3.8 to 7.5), and coarse to medium texture (gravelly,

sandy, silty, loamy).  However, it will tolerate moist 
clay soils and sites that are nutritionally poor.  This 
species prefers moderate to good drainage. It is less 
tolerant to flooding and poor drainage than red alder.  
Plants resprout from the crown after fire. 
 
Distribution- Sitka alder occurs naturally from 
central Alaska south to northern California and east 
to Alberta, northwest Wyoming, and western 
Montana. The elevation range is sea-level to 9000 ft 
in the mountains.  Habitat includes moist montane 
woods, rocky or sandy coastlines and talus slopes, 
streambanks, lakeshores, and the north face of rocky 
outcrops.    
 
Limitations or environmental concerns  
Sitka alder is host to a number of insect pests 
including root weevils, flea beetles, leaf rollers, 
borers, sawflies, leaf minors, scales, and aphids. 
Pathogens include leaf spots, powdery mildew, alder 
top-kill, and stem cankers. Some of these diseases 
can show up in nursery stock.   The species readily 
volunteers into disturbed areas, making it potentially 
weedy and a competitor with valuable timber trees. 
Toxicity for this plant has not been reported.  
 
Establishment  
Sitka alder cannot be propagated by dormant 
hardwood cuttings but success may be possible with 
green stem cuttings treated with 2000 ppm IBA 
(indole-butyric acid) plus a rooting powder and 
placed in a mist bench with bottom heat. 
dry conditions. Stored seed is often dormant and 
requires 14 days to 3 months of prechilling (cold 
moist stratification) at 34 to 38°F, or fall sowing. 
Seed can be surface sown or covered with a very 
thin layer of soil, potting media, or mulch.  Seedling 
establishment can benefit from the inoculation of 
roots with appropriate strains of Frankia bacteria (to 
stimulate nodule formation) and ectomychor-rhizal 
fungi. Fall planting is best along with the use of 
mulch and protection from animals.  
  
Improved cultivars and selected materials (and 
area of origin)  
For revegetation at low elevation in western Oregon 
and Washington, the Plant Materials Center in 
Corvallis, OR, released Skamania Germplasm, a 
selected class pre-variety from Skamania Co., WA. 
Studies in British Columbia showed clear 
geographic patterns in frost hardiness, growth, and 
other traits that related to latitude and distance from 
the Coast.  This and other work suggests that for 
land rehabilitation, material originating from the 
same region and similar habitat should be favored.

species is a thicket-forming shrub or small tree 3-12 
meters tall with smooth brown bark, slender 
branches, and oblong leaves coarsely toothed along 
the upper edge.  A typical plant is comprised of long 
shoots and short shoots. only short shoots bear fruit.  
Floral buds are formed in the first season, but fruit 
develops the following season.  Clusters of perfect 
white flowers appear in spring before leaves, and 
dark purple to black berrylike fruits are produced in 
mid- or late summer.  It is self pollinated or cross-
pollinated via insects.  The fruit contains 4-10 dark 
brown seeds with leathery seed coats.  This species 
may not flower and reproduce before 10 years or 
longer, especially on harsh sites.

populations and early settlers of the Pacific 
Northwest.  The berries were eaten raw or cooked or 
dried and stored.  Cakes of dried berries were a 
common trading item.  The wood is hard and was 
used for combs, digging sticks, arrows, tool handles, 
hoops, and spreaders.  Decoctions of stems and twigs 
(bark) were used as medicine. 
Ornamentals: Pacific serviceberry may be used in 
naturalized plantings and as hedges in urban areas.  
Several cultivars of saskatoon serviceberry 
(Amelanchier alnifolia) are available for ornamental 
plantings and commercial fruit production. Many of 
these cultivars and ecotypes originated in western 
Canada and the northern region of the United States.

UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_Establishment='Seeding: Seed propagation can result in variability in 
select traits of 20-30%.  Many growers use open-
pollinated seedlings from named cultivars for 
commercial orchard establishment as the serviceberry 
is difficult to vegetatively propagate by conventional 
means.  It is important to note that usually a large 
percentage of seed collected from wild populations is 
infertile and insect-infested.  Seeds per pound can 
range from 36,000 to 113,000 or a mean of 61,000.  
Air-dried seed may be stored in sealed containers 
with little decline in viability for 5 years.  In the 
nursery, Pacific serviceberry is seeded at the rate of 
25 pure live seeds per foot of row.  This seeding rate 
may be reduced to obtain desired or original 
composition on sites being restored or improved.  
Unstratified seed is planted in late fall, and moist, 
pre-chilled seed is planted in spring, at a depth of 
0.25 inches. 
Cuttings: Reports of rooting success using softwood 
cuttings are variable. Timing of cutting and stage of 
growth of the mother shrub are important factors in 
rooting success.  Transplants or containerized stock 
should be planted in early spring (harsh, cold sites) or 
fall.  Moist soil, mulch, and partial shade enhance 
survival and growth.  Bare-root stock may be planted 
in early spring.  Two-year-old seedlings may be lifted 
in fall and stored at 33O F till planting.  Seedlings 
may be planted in rows. between row and within row 
spacing should be a minimum of 12 feet and 6 feet, 
respectively.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD fs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_Management=' 
For orchards and ornamental specimens, branches 
that are more than 4 years old should be pruned out 
for better fruit production and longer life span.  
Yearly fertilization with 100 pounds per acre of 
ammonium nitrate will improve color, size, and 
quality of fruit in older stands.  Weed control 
(chemical and mechanical) and irrigation also 
enhance fruit production.  Well-maintained orchards 
can produce fruit for 20 years. 
For streambank or riparian restoration, Pacific 
serviceberry (2-year-old stock) should be planted on 
the upper bank.  Weed control and supplemental 
irrigation during the first growing season enhance 
survival and growth.  Moderate browsing can 
increase twig production.  Spring burns on high 
elevation rangeland can cause mortality but also 
significantly increase twig production in Pacific 
serviceberry.

Another moisture conservation attribute of American 
beachgrass is that the rough upper leaf surface, 
containing gas exchange openings (stomata), will 
orient itself away from winds.  The seedhead emerges 
in late July or August as a spike-like cluster at the 
tips of long stalks.  This multi-flowered panicle 
extends about ten inches above the leaves.  Seed 
production is usually poor.

Center 
 
Figure 1. Leadplant showing purple flowers and gray lead-colored 
leaves. Photo by Alan Shadow (2006) USDA NRCS. 
Alternate Names 
Lead-plant, leadplant amorpha, downy indigobush, prairie 
shoestrings, buffalo bellows, Amorpha brachycarpa 
Uses 
Erosion control: Planted for erosion control because it has 
deep, branching, woody root system. 
 
Ethnobotanic: Many Native American tribes used 
leadplant in many ways.  Most made a tea from the leaves 
and drank the tea, sometimes as a medicine to treat 
ailments such as pinworms, eczema, rheumatism, 
neuralgia, open wounds, and cuts.  Some tribes made a 
substance to smoke from leadplant leaves and buffalo fat.  
Some believed that it could be used to make a “medicine” 
to attract buffalo to the person that had it on their 
clothing.  Some tribes named the plant “buffalo bellows” 
because the timing of flowering coincided with the time 
of the year that the buffalo were in rut and bellowing. 
 
 
 
 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
Landscaping and restoration: Leadplant is an ideal 
ornamental species because it has showy flowers, is 
drought tolerant, and shade tolerant.  It also forms nodules 
on its roots to fix nitrogen and can be used for prairie 
restorations. 
 
Wildlife and livestock: It is a floral food resource for 
pollinating insects, including solitary bees.  It is very 
palatable to livestock and wildlife, including cattle, sheep, 
horses, elk, and deer. 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
Description and Adaptation 
 
Leadplant distribution from USDA-NRCS PLANTS Database. 
Leadplant is a subshrub to herbaceous perennial with 
multiple stems that can get to about 3 ft tall.  Leaves are 
odd-pinnately compound and covered in dense lead-
colored silver-gray hairs (giving the plant its common 
name).  Purple flowers have one petal and are along the 
top parts of some of the stems.  The stamens are orange in 
color and when found extend out past the petal.  The fruits 
are small pods that contain one seed, which is smooth and 
brown.   
Leadplant can occur in soils that are somewhat acidic to 
alkaline and can tolerate some salinity.  It is resistant to 
occurrences of fire and can tolerate a moderate amount of 
grazing.  Leadplant is a good indicator of well managed 
lands that have moderate to low levels of livestock 
grazing.  Leadplant is native to areas in Manitoba and 
Ontario.  In the U.S. it occurs from Montana east to 


Page 2
Michigan, and south to New Mexico and Louisiana.  For 
updated distribution, please consult the Plant Profile page 
for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
Establishment 
Prepare a firm, weed-free seedbed and plant pods 
separately or in rows that alternate with grasses.  Seed 
should be inoculated prior to seeding.  Seed should be 
planted 1/4 in. to 3/16 in. deep in the spring or fall, 
depending on stratification requirements.  For full stands 
of leadplant a seeding rate of 20 to 30 pure live seed 
(PLS) per square foot is needed.  For seeding in grass or 
grass forb mixtures use a seeding rate of 0.5 to 1 PLS per 
acre. 
 
Seed will need to be stratified.  Methods for stratification 
of seed are to sow seeds in the fall and let them stratify 
over winter or soak in 180-200˚F (82-93˚C) water for 12 
hours then moist chill seed at 41˚F (5˚C) for 30 days.  
Germination will be between 14 and 20 days after 
planting. 
 
Leadplant can also be propagated by greenwood or 
hardwood cuttings.  Transplanting success is generally 
poor in prairie restorations. 
Management 
Initially grazing should be withheld and weeds controlled 
by mowing above seedlings during establishment period.  
Graze or mow conservatively and periodically graze only 
after dormancy to sustain cover and high production 
improvement, leaving tall stubble.  The presence of 
leadplant on native rangeland is usually indicative of a 
well managed area. 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Common pests of leadplant are grasshoppers, leafhoppers, 
and small mammals.  Leaf spots, rusts, downy mildew, 
 
and Cytospora amorphae have been found on leadplant 
but they are not considered major diseases. 
Environmental Concerns 
There are no known environmental concerns associated 
with leadplant. 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
These plant materials are somewhat readily available 
from commercial sources.  No known cultivars, improved, 
or selected materials of leadplant are known at this time.

            Plant Fact Sheet  
 
Livestock: Big bluestem is one of the most palatable 
warm season grasses and is preferred over 
switchgrass by livestock.  Therefore, in pastures, it 
should be planted alone for best management, 
especially where continuous or extensive grazing 
practices are used.  It can be mixed with other species 
for intensive, rotational grazing. 
Wildlife: Birds and mammals use big bluestem for 
nesting and escape cover in summer and winter.  It 
resists lodging under snow cover almost as well as 
switchgrass, thereby contributing to spring nesting 
habitat.

its growth habit, is used with certain conservation 
practices. however, conservation practice standards 
and specifications vary by state.  By going to the e-
FOTG website for your state you can read if this

Livestock: Sand bluestem is a good to excellent 
forage due to its palatability and high yield.  Under 
continued heavy grazing pressure it will die out and 
be replaced by other less desirable plants.  It is an 
important component of many native hay meadows.  
The nutritive value of sand bluestem rises and falls 
with the growing season.  It is high in crude protein 
and palatability until just prior to seedhead formation. 
After seedheads are formed the nutritive value and 
palatability decreases significantly. 
 
Wildlife: Sand bluestem is good to excellent forage 
for all browsing wildlife species.  Upland birds eat 
the seeds.  Because it frequently grows in large 
clumps and retains an upright vegetative structure 
throughout the winter it makes an excellent nesting 
habitat for many upland birds and small mammals. 
 
Ornamental Landscaping:  As xeric landscaping 
becomes more popular the use of sand bluestem has 
increased in yard plantings.  Because of its height and 
growth form many consider it an excellent plant for 
lawn and flower bed borders.

Plant Fact Sheet
Status  
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g. threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values).  
 
Description and Adaptation  
Splitbeard bluestem is a warm season, native, perennial 
bunchgrass. This grass is a member of the 
Andropogoneae tribe of grasses. Splitbeard bluestem 
grows to mature height of 0.7 to 1.2 meters tall (2 to 4 
feet). The upper half to 2/3 of the plant is branching in 
appearance. The stems are usually long, slender, and 
erect. They are often purplish to reddish green with green 
upper sheaths. The flat leaves are 20-45 cm long (8-18 
inches) and 2-4 mm wide (1/16-5/32 inches). Both the 
leaves and sheaths are often densely hairy and have a 
waxy silver appearance. The inflorescence has three to six 
pairs of racemes about 2 inches long with a white tuft at 
the base. The seedhead is a showy silvery – white that 
contrasts with the green foliage and stems of the plant. 
Splitbeard bluestem begins growing in April and 
continues through the summer. The plant produces seed 
from September to November.  
 
 
Distribution of Andropogon ternarius Michx. from PLANTS database 
 
Splitbeard bluestem is distributed from Delaware to 
Kentucky and Kansas and south to Florida and Texas. It is 
especially wide spread in the eastern half of Texas. This 
plant grows on medium and coarse textured soils with a 
pH ranging from 4 to 7.5. Splitbeard bluestem prefers 
open woods or woodland pastures on sandy soils. This 
grass is moderately shade tolerant, but seldom dominates 
a plant community.  
 
 
 


Page 2
 
 
Establishment  
The seed should be planted in late winter as a dormant 
seeding. Plant the seeds at a depth of ¼ to ¾ inch using a 
seeding rate of 10 to 12 pounds pure live seed/acre.  
 
Management  
It is not recommended to include splitbeard bluestem in a 
seed mix with cool season species. This grass is not 
common enough to be a key management species. 
Splitbeard bluestem is grazed by cattle in the spring after 
growth starts. However, they ignore splitbeard bluestem 
as it matures during the growing season.  A stubble height 
of at least 6” is recommended when mowing or grazing. It 
will withstand periodic controlled burning. However, 
annual burning followed by grazing tends to eventually 
eliminate this species from the site’s plant community.  
 
Pests and Potential Problems  
Splitbeard bluestem has no known pests or problems.  
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin)  
There are no known cultivars available. however common 
seed and container plants are readily available from a 
number of growers, wholesalers, and retailers of native 
seed.

Uses 
Livestock: Broomsedge bluestem is not considered 
important cattle forage.  It provides grazing in spring and 
early summer. However, nutritional quality and 
palatability quickly decrease as the summer progresses.    
 
Wildlife: Small birds utilize the seed in winter when other 
food supplies are limited. Broomsedge bluestem provides 
cover for ground nesting birds such as quail and turkeys.  
 
Plant Fact Sheet
It is a larval host for the Zabulon Skipper butterfly 
(Poanes zabulon).   
  
Ornamental: Broomsedge bluestem is used as an 
ornamental plant.  It is recommended for golf courses and 
residential landscaping because it requires low amounts of 
water.  In the fall, the foliage turns a reddish orange and 
retains this color during winter dormancy, thereby adding 
color to the winter landscape.   
  
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site 
(http://plants.usda.gov ) and your State Department of 
Natural Resources for this plant’s current status (e.g. 
threatened or endangered species, state noxious status, 
and wetland indicator values). 
 
Description and Adaptation 
Broomsedge bluestem is a native warm season perennial 
bunchgrass that grows 2 to 4 feet tall.  The leaves are flat 
to partly folded 10 to 15 inches long and approximately 
1/8 inch wide.  The fringed ligule is 1/16 inch long.  The 
flattened basal leaf sheaths are colorless or yellow. The 
rest of the plant is a pale greenish yellow. Broomsedge 
bluestem produces many seeds on the upper half of the 
plant that are distributed by the wind.  At a distance the 
inflorescence may appear silvery in the sunlight. 
 
Broomsedge bluestem grows where average rainfall is 
greater than 25 inches.   It is found throughout the eastern 
portion of the United States. The grass is found in open 
areas such as abandoned fields, overgrazed pastures, cut-
over timber sites, and rights of way.   Broomsedge grows 
on a wide variety of soils, preferring loose, sandy, moist 
sites with low fertility and is an indicator of low 
phosphorus soils. It also is a shallow rooted plant. 
 
Distribution: Please consult the Plant Profile page for this 
species on the PLANTS Web site. 
 
Establishment  
Broomsedge bluestem can be established by direct 
seeding or transplanting.  Direct seeding is the preferred 
method of establishing a broomsedge bluestem stand. 
Prepare a firm, weed free seedbed by discing and 
cultipacking.  The site may be prepared by treating the 
planting area in the spring with a nonselective herbicide 
such as glyphosate to kill existing vegetation then using a 
no-till type drill to plant.  
 
The best time to plant broomsedge bluestem seeds is in 
the spring when soil temperature is at least 55°F or 
greater.  The seed should be planted no more than ¼ inch

deep. Broomsedge bluestem seeds germinate well and 
readily begin growing on exposed soil.  Two methods for 
planting the seed are drilling and broadcast planting.  A 
drill is the preferred method due to proper seed placement 
and spacing.  The drill should be capable of planting light, 
fluffy seed at a planting rate of 8 pounds of pure live seed 
(PLS) per acre.  When broadcast planting the seed, 
increase the planting rate to 12 PLS per acre.  It will be 
necessary to add a carrier material to the broomsedge 
bluestem seed when broadcast planting is done. Carriers 
include rice hulls, sand, or sawdust.  Without an 
accompanying carrier material, the broomsedge bluestem 
seed will not flow well through the broadcaster and be 
unevenly distributed in the field. After broadcast planting, 
run a cultipacker or roller over the planting to ensure seed 
to soil contact.   
  
Broomsedge seedlings grow quickly. In a North Carolina 
study, first-year seedlings averaged five inches in height.  
One and two year old plants averaged 40 inches in height 
and 3 inches in basal circumference (Keever, 1950).  Seed 
production begins when plants reach two to three years of 
age.  
  
Transplants of broomsedge bluestem are best used for 
small areas and high visibility sites.  Transplants are 
usually more costly than direct seeding.  Professional 
installations may cost between $1.00 per square foot for 
small plants and up to $10.00 per square foot for gallon 
pots. To produce transplants, divide larger plant crowns 
into smaller plants.  Divide plant crowns so that each 
small plant includes healthy, viable stems.  The best time 
for transplanting is in the spring. Dig a hole just large 
enough to accommodate plant roots without bunching, 
and then fill in around the plant with soil.  After planting, 
water the transplants so they will have adequate moisture 
and the soil will settle around the roots.  Prevent weed 
seed germination by applying a pre-emergent herbicide or 
mulch, after planting.  
  
Management  
Native grasses grow slowly and require two to three years 
to fully establish.  Mowing is an effective method for 
controlling weeds.  Mow above the tops of the 
broomsedge bluestem to reduce weed competition.  
Mowing only the tops keeps from covering up the small 
grass seedlings.   
  
Weeds can also be controlled by selective herbicides. 
Imazapic herbicides will control broadleaf weeds and is 
labeled for use on most warm season grasses. Apply 
imazapic herbicides in the spring using a boom sprayer 
after the broadleaf weeds have begun growing.  
  
In certain situations, broomsedge bluestem is considered a 
pasture weed.  It increases in plant numbers as more 
desirable vegetation is selectively grazed by livestock.  If 
left uncontrolled, broomsedge bluestem can become the 
dominant grass in abused, overgrazed range and pastures.  
 
 
Avoid overgrazing of desirable grasses by managing the 
number of animals, the duration of their grazing, and 
amount of herbage that is removed from the pasture.  Do 
not rely on calendar days to determine the number of days 
for animals to graze a pasture, instead schedule grazing 
based on plant growth of key species and available forage.  
If warm season grasses are the desirable species, remove 
grazing animals when the grasses have 6 to 8 inches of 
stubble height remaining.  Contact your local USDA-
NRCS field office for assistance in planning a prescribed 
grazing plan.    
  
Vegetative growth of broomsedge bluestem begins in 
early spring.  To reduce the amount of broomsedge 
bluestem in a pasture, heavily graze it in early spring 
when the grass is most palatable and then defer grazing 
for 60 to 90 days.  Increase the soil fertility by adding 
nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium based upon soil tests 
and fertilizer recommendations. Fertilizing the desirable 
species will help them compete successfully with the 
broomsedge.  
  
Pests and Potential Problems  
On infertile soils, broomsedge is a long-lived competitor.  
Broomsedge bluestem has allelopathic chemicals which 
adversely affected other plants (Rice, 1972).  
   
Environmental Concerns  
Broomsedge bluestem was inadvertently introduced to the 
Hawaiian Islands in 1932.  It is considered noxious there 
because it invades native Hawaiian plant communities 
and alters the fire and hydrology regimes (Diggs, et al., 
2006).  
  
Control 
By itself, prescribed burning has little detrimental effect 
on broomsedge bluestem and is not an effective means of 
control.  The aboveground biomass is removed. in 
response, the plant quickly begins new vegetative growth 
after a burn.  However, the new vegetative growth can be 
treated with herbicides.  
  
Glyphosate herbicides are an effective chemicals to use 
for control of broomsedge bluestem. Glyphosate 
herbicides are non-selective.  Broadcast spraying of  a 
glyphosate herbicide will result in killing both 
broomsedge bluestem and desirable vegetation. 
Therefore, broadcast spraying is not recommended for 
established stands of desirable vegetation.  If a complete 
canopy kill is the objective, apply the herbicide using a 
boom sprayer.  Apply the herbicide when the plants are 
actively growing.  A follow-up application may be 
needed.  
  
Selective application of glyphosate, such as wicking or 
spot treatment is recommended in established pastures.  
When using a wick, raise it above the desired vegetation 
and sweep the top of the broomsedge bluestem.  If the 
treatment site is smaller with isolated broomsedge 

Page 3
 
 
colonies, a backpack sprayer is a feasible option to apply 
herbicide.  Make herbicide applications when the 
broomsedge bluestem plants are actively growing.   
  
For all chemical control methods, always read and follow 
label and safety instructions.  Consult your extension 
weed specialist or county agent for recommended 
herbicides.  Control measures appear in this document 
only to provide specific information.  USDA NRCS does 
not guarantee or warranty the products and control 
methods named, and other products may be equally

is rated “good” to “fair” for domestic sheep and “fair” to 
“poor” for horses. 
 
Landscape: Prairie sagewort is drought tolerant and ideal 
for the xeriscape landscape.  The thin, silver-gray leaves 
have a pleasant herbal scent and remain semi-evergreen in 
mild climates. 
 
Ethnobotanical: Prairie sagewort has a rich history of 
utilization by Native American tribes. Uses range from 
preservatives for meat, horsefeed, insect repellent 
(through burning of the plant),  medicinal decoctions to 
alleviate toothache, headache, coughing, lung ailments, 
heartburn, and as a cold remedy. Early settlers used 
prairie sage to make a bitter tea which they believed was a 
tonic and remedy for typhoid fever.  A.  frigida is listed as 
a source of camphor although it has not been recognized 
by the U.S. Pharmacopoeia for this purpose.

Forage:  Prairie sagewort varies considerably in its value 
as forage for livestock.  It has been considered to be both 
an adequate forage species and a nuisance species, and 
may play an important role on winter pastures.  For cattle, 
palatability varies from “unpalatable” to “fairly good.”  It

Pollinators:  Even though the small flowers are wind-
pollinated, Artemisia species are used as food plants by 
the larvae of a number of Lepidoptera species and other 
insects. 
 
Wildlife:  Big game such as elk, mule deer, bighorn 
sheep, and pronghorn tend to utilize prairie sagewort in 
spring, autumn, and winter months.  Sage-grouse and 
greater prairie-chickens utilize prairie sagewort (although 
other sage species may be preferred) as both adults and 
juveniles, and chicks consume insects associated with the 
plants.  Prairie sagewort is also important to small game 
and nongame mammals including, in part, white-tailed 
jack rabbits, desert cottontails, and black-tailed prairie 
dogs.

General: Sunflower Family (Asteraceae).  
Prairie sage is a mound-forming, spreading sub-shrub 
with flowering stalks reaching 4-16 inches tall.   Covering 
the plant is an abundance of silvery hairs giving it a silky 
grey-green appearance. The leaves are round in outline 
and 3 to 5 times divided, abundant, clustered toward the 
base, and scattered along the stem. The lower leaves are 
stalked (petiolate) 0.5 in long, with the upper leaves 
becoming sessile (no stalk). Flower clusters are a quarter 
inch in diameter and made up of numerous tiny disk 
flowers. The plant is strongly aromatic.  Prairie sagewort 
blooms from July to August.

of the rootstock, or by cuttings taken in the early summer.  
Germination is improved with a cold treatment and seed 
should be broadcast or planted shallowly ( 1/8 inch deep). 
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
None known at this time. 
 
Environmental Concerns 
Due to prairie sagewort’s drought and grazing resistant 
nature, it may increase rapidly and become dominant.

Wildlife: Sage grouse are the heaviest users of

is made up of foliage and flower clusters of the plant.  
Antelope eat substantial amounts of sagebrush 
throughout the year, and mule deer feed heavily on 
the plant during late fall, winter, and spring, 
particularly if other foods are covered with snow.  
Sharp-tailed grouse, jackrabbits, elk, and many 
species of small mammals eat sagebrush sparingly 
during various times of the year.  Sagebrush provides 
nesting cover for sage grouse, and to a lesser extent 
pheasants and several species of prairie sparrows.  It

periodically.  The finely textured velvety branches 
are initially white to pale green, becoming smooth 
and red-brown with maturity.  The small solitary 
three scaled buds are dark brown.   
The simple leaves of this broadleaf evergreen are 
alternately arranged on branches.  Each leaf is held 
by a twisted leaf stalk, vertically.  The leathery dark 
green leaves are an inch long and have rounded tips 
tapering back to the base.  In fall, the leaves begin 
changing from a dark green to a reddish-green to 
purple. 
 
 
Terminal clusters of small urn-shaped flowers bloom 
from May to June.  The perfect flowers are white to 
pink, and bear round, fleshy or mealy, bright red to 
pink fruits called drupes.  This smooth, glossy 
skinned fruit will range from 1/4 to 1/2 inch in 
diameter.  The fruit will persist on the plant into early 
winter.  Each drupe contains 1 to 5 hard seeds, which 
need to be scarified and stratified prior to 
germination to reduce the seed coat and break 
embryo dormancy.  There is an average of 40,900 
cleaned seeds per pound.

Seed should be mechanically scarified to break down 
dormancy due to hard seed coat.  It is also desirable 
to inoculate seed with species-specific rhizobium for 
nitrogen fixing.  Plant seed shallow at a depth of 1/2

planting method is to use the legume box of a grass 
seed drill for the Canadian milkvetch seed.  Low 
rates of seed may need to be mixed with filler

method of choice is to mix the Canadian milkvetch 
seed with the other native species in one of the other 
seed boxes.  If seed settles to the bottom of the box, it 
should be added in frequent intervals rather than all at 
once.  If conditions do not permit the use of a drill, 
double the seeding rate, broadcast the seed, and cover 
lightly by harrowing.

Uses 
As a pollinator, the attractive and sweet-smelling flowers 
of Mancos milkvetch are frequented by a variety of 
pollinators including members of the bee family, Osmia 
titusi and O. sculleni, as well as by honey bees.  
Butterflies are also often seen resting on the fragrant plant 
when it is in bloom. It has no known agricultural, 
economic, or other human uses at this time. 
Status 
Mancos milkvetch is listed as endangered without critical 
habitat throughout its range by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service (USFWS).  Please consult the PLANTS Web site 
and your State Department of Natural Resources for this 
plant’s current status (e.g., threatened or endangered 
species, state noxious status, and wetland indicator 
values). 
Description and Adaptation 
General:   
Pea family (Fabaceae).  Mancos milkvetch is a 
diminutive, low-growing, tufted perennial sub-shrub 
growing in clumps up to 12 inches (in) (30 centimeters 
 
 
Figure 2. Mancos milvetch distribution from USDA-NRCS PLANTS 
Database. 
 
Adaptation 
Mancos milkvetch is adapted to occur within a narrow 
band of Mesozoic sandstone derived from the Hogback 
geologic formation.  Occupied habitat is confined to large 
sheets of exfoliating sandstone substrate ledges and mesa 
tops where plants grow in cracks or shallow bowl-like 
depressions (tinajas) that accumulate sandy soils and 
rainfall at 5,650 feet, (1,854 meters) in elevation . This 
species occurs within an average annual precipitation 
range of 5-10 inches (12-25 cm). Common plant 
associates include: scabrous bricklebush (Brickellia 
microphyla var. scabra), single leaf ash (Fraxinus 
anomala), small leaf mohagany (Cercocarpus intricatus), 
and rosy ipomosis (Ipomopisis roseata).   
Mancos milkvetch is a narrow endemic known only from 
the Four Corners region of the southwestern United 
States. Its known global distribution includes 13 sites, 
including 3 sites from Colorado in Montezuma County 
and 10 sites from New Mexico, in San Juan County.   


Page 2
For updated distribution, please consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
Establishment 
Seed germination trials conducted by the Arboretum at 
Flagstaff, Arizona have shown that this species is difficult 
to establish from seed and difficult to keep in cultivation 
as it is sensitive to over- or under-watering.  Low 
fecundity is commonly found in plants of the genus 
Astragalus particularly where species persist in small, 
highly restricted populations which are endemic to 
particular geologic formation. 
 
Mancos milkvetch plants produce viable fruit by 
outcrossing and self-pollination.  Each fruit of Mancos 
milkvetch produces 4 to 9 seeds in its egg-shaped pods.  It 
takes two growing seasons for seedlings to mature, with 
flowering usually the third and fourth year compared to 
other species of Astragalus, which generally take one 
growing season to bloom. 
 
Management 
Mancos milkvetch is threatened by surface disturbance 
activities associated with energy exploration and 
development and transmission line construction and 
maintenance, as well as recreational off-highway vehicle 
(OHV) use. The plant s habitat occurs in areas of active 
oil and gas development.  Nearly all known and potential 
habitat may be affected by natural gas or oil exploration 
and development.  Most damage occurs after vehicles and 
heavy equipment drive over and crush individual plants as 
well as break apart sandstone areas that contain tinajas, 
which are a requirement for Mancos milkvetch 
establishment.   
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Spider mite insect infestations have been noted to cause 
mortality, especially when the plants are already stressed 
by drought. Larval bruchine beetles of the genus 
Acanthoscelides may also feed upon Mancos milkvetch 
seeds as evidenced by pin-sized emergence holes on the 
seed pods. 
Environmental Concerns 
The decrease in population numbers of Mancos milkvetch 
is thought to be due to several notable drought periods of 
the recent past.  Some recovery with new seedlings has 
occurred but appears to be triggered by both adult 
mortality and increased moisture events.

Alternate Names 
Rose milkweed 
Pleurisy Root 
White Indian hemp 
Warning: Swamp milkweed may be toxic when taken 
internally without sufficient preparation. 
Uses 
Conservation: Swamp milkweed is a native, colonizing, 
perennial wildflower useful for wetland rehabilitation. It 
is a good component of a wildlife seed mixture when 
seeded with native grasses and wildflowers. It prefers 
moisture retentive to damp soils in full sun to partial 
shade. 
Wildlife: Swamp milkweed is a favored food of monarch 
butterfly (Danaus plexippus) larva (shown in the picture 
above). Swamp milkweed is also an important food 
source for the queen butterfly (Danaus glippus) larva. 
Various other butterflies and hummingbirds consume 
nectar from the flowers.   
 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
Ethnobotanical: The Chippewa and Iroquois have used an 
infusion of the roots externally to strengthen the body and 
heal babies’ navels. The Iroquois and Meskwaki have also 
used a decoction of the roots and/or aerial portions of the 
plant as an emetic, diuretic, and anthelmintic (de-
worming agent). The common name, Pleurisy Root, 
comes from its once common use to treat lung problems.  
Swamp milkweed is toxic when taken in large doses.  The 
tough stringy stem fibers have been used to make twine, 
rope and rough textiles.  
The downy parachutes (comas) that are attached to each 
seed are six times more buoyant that cork and five times 
warmer than wool. Large quantities of milkweed were 
grown for use as stuffing in pillows and lifejackets during 
World War II.   
Landscape: Swamp milkweed is a tall plant with fragrant, 
showy clusters of pink and light purple flowers. It does 
well in landscape plantings with moist soil and in 
plantings near bodies of water. Unlike many ornamentals, 
swamp milkweed tolerates heavy clay soils and is very 
deer-resistant. It is a more cultivated alternative to 
common milkweed that is also attractive to egg-laying 
Monarchs.   
Livestock: The bitter leaves of swamp milkweed do not 
appeal to livestock. sheep are especially susceptible to the 
poisonous compounds in swamp milkweed, and sheep 
fatalities have been reported after consuming the plant. 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values).

Description: Swamp milkweed is a native, perennial, 
wildflower growing three to six feet tall. It gets its 
common name from its white sap, although it has less sap 
than many of its relatives. The genus was named in honor 
of Aesculapius, Greek god of medicine, undoubtedly 
because some species have long been used to treat a 
variety of ailments. The Latin species name means flesh-
colored.  It has long, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that 
progress in pairs up the stem. Bright pink, white and 
purple clusters of flowers appear in summer at the tops of 
the stems. In the fall, blooms give way to distinctive tear-
shaped five-inch seed pods that are green when unripe, 
but harden to brown. The individual seeds are attached to 
fluffy hairs that allow the seeds to drift on the wind. 
Swamp milkweed also spreads through rhizomes (roots 
that grow horizontally from the original plant).  
Adaptation and distribution: Swamp milkweed is widely 
distributed across the U.S. and Canada from Quebec and 
Maine south to Florida and Texas and west to Nevada and 
Idaho. It prefers neutral to slightly acidic soil, although it 
will tolerate a pH up to 8.0. Its moisture requirements are 
high, and it is primarily found in moist habitats such as 
wet meadows, floodplains, riverbanks, pond shores, 
stream banks, wet woods, swamps, and marshes, although 
it will also grow in drier areas such as prairies, fields, and 
roadsides. Swamp milkweed needs full sun or partial 
shade to flourish. It is insect-pollinated and self-fertilizing 
Establishment 
Propagation by seeds:  Collect seeds in the fall, when the 
brown pods are dry and have begun to split. Crack the 
pods open completely allowing the seeds to dry for one to 
two weeks in paper bags.  Several weevil larvae prey on 
developing seeds, so look for signs of damage including 
small entry holes in the pod exuding latex.  Once they are 
dry, place the seeds into plastic bags filled with moist 
perlite or vermiculite and store them in a cold place, 
approximately 35 to 38 degrees Fahrenheit, for at least 4 
to 12 weeks (stratification). Good germination results 
have been reported without stratification by soaking the 
seed.  Soak the seed in hot water (190 degrees Fahrenheit) 
for 12 hours. Repeat this process two additional times for 
expected seed germination of 50%.  Seed can be placed in 
cold storage for up to three years.  
To grow plants, use germination trays with cells two 
inches wide and four inches deep. Fill the cells with a 
commercial seedling mixture or a mix of sphagnum peat 
moss and vermiculite and moisten well. Press the seed 
gently into the soil, three seed per cell, and cover with a 
very thin layer of soil. Keep the soil moist during 
 
 
germination by spraying or misting. Ambient 
temperatures should remain between 65 and 75 degrees 
Fahrenheit. Swamp milkweed seed requires light for 
germination. Germination is poor at temperatures higher 
than 85 degrees Fahrenheit. Seedlings should not be 
transplanted until they have at least one set of true leaves. 
Allow 4 to 8 weeks inside growing time for seedlings 
before moving to a cold frame or transplanting outside.  
Plants can be moved outside once the danger of frost has 
passed.   
Management 
Swamp milkweed spreads through rhizomes. established 
plants can be divided in late spring. Swamp milkweed is a 
relatively long-lived (and slow-growing) herbaceous 
perennial. 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Swamp milkweed attracts the orange milkweed aphid. If 
plants begin to look unhealthy, spray them with a soap 
solution or high-pressure blasts of water.   
Environmental Concerns 
None at this time. 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials  
The cultivars ‘Ice Ballet’ and ‘Cinderella’ can be found at 
many native plant nurseries.

Warning:  Kremmling milkvetch is a selenium 
accumulator and may cause selenium poisoning. 
 
 
 
 
Uses 
The flowers are white and showy, attracting a variety of 
pollinators. Primary pollinators include Apis mellifera, 
Bombus sp., and Osmia sp.  Kremmling milkvetch is of 
economic significance as an indicator of selenium and as 
a potentially toxic plant in rangelands.   
Status 
Kremmling milkvetch was listed as “endangered” under 
the Endangered Species Act in 1989.  
 
The NatureServe conservation status rank, an 
international effort which rank species on their “global” 
status, denotes Kremmling milkvetch as G1/S1- critically 
imperiled globally and statewide, because of  its extreme 
rarity, it is especially vulnerable to extinction.   
 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
Description and Adaptation 
Pea family (Fabaceae).  Kremmling milkvetch, is a 
relatively tall plant with linear leaflets and several bright 
green stems reaching up to 40 inches (100 centimeters) in 
height. There are 12—25 white flowers, 1 in. (2.4 cm) 
long, per inflorescence, each ultimately with stipitate 
pendulous pods, 1.8 in. (4.5 cm) long.  Astragalus 
pattersonii  and A. bisulcatus  are similar species also 
with a relatively tall growth form.  The three species may 
be separated as follows: Kremmling milkvetch is 
distinguished from A. pattersonii by its long, pendulous 
fruits that are laterally compressed, from A. bisulcatus by 
its large, white flowers, and from both by its lime-green, 
linear leaflets. 
 
Kremmling milkvetch is adapted to grow on highly 
seleniferous, grayish-brown clay soils derived from shales 
of Niobrara, Pierre, and Troublesome formations.  
Kremmling milkvetch occurs on shaley slopes at middle 
elevations ranging from 7,400 – 7,900 feet (2,256 – 2,408 
meters) within the sagebrush parks eco-region with an 
average annual precipitation of 10-16 inches.  
 
Habitat:  
Kremmling milkvetch occurs on moderate slopes, on 
white shale outcrops of the Niobrara, Pierre, and 
Troublesome Formations in northern Grand County, 
Colorado. The chaparral/shrubland habitat includes the 
following common plant associates: big sagebrush 
(Artemesia tridentata), yellow rabbitbrush 



Page 2
(Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus), broom snakeweed 
(Gutierrezia sarothrae), winterfat (Krascheninnikovia 
lanata), spiny phlox (Phlox hoodii), shortstem buckwheat 
(Eriogonum brevicaule), and western wheatgrass 
(Pascopyrum smithii).   
 
 
Figure 2: Kremmling milkvetch distribution from USDA-NRCS PLANTS 
Database. 
Kremmling milkvetch is known to be endemic only to a 
localized area near the town of Kremmling, in Middle 
Park, Colorado.  The current known global distribution 
includes five small and scattered populations within an 
eight-mile radius, occupying an estimated 800 acres of 
habitat near the town of Kremmling in Middle Park, 
Colorado. 
For updated distribution, please consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
Establishment 
Seeds of Kremmling milkvetch exhibit physical dormancy 
requiring scarification in order to germinate.  Kremmling 
milkvetch may be mycorrhizaland , a symbiotic 
dinitrogen fixer with Rhizobium bacteria, as nearly all 
Astragalus species.  Kremmling milkvetch plants produce 
viable seeds by both outcrossing and self-pollination, with 
higher fruit set from self-pollination.  Low fecundity is 
commonly found in the Astragalus genus, many species 
persist in small, highly restricted populations which are 
endemic to particular geologic formations. 
 
 
Management 
Kremmling milkvetch is threatened by commercial, 
residential, and agricultural property development, and 
the associated new utility installations and access roads, 
reservoir operations and expansion, off-highway vehicle 
recreation, oil and gas exploration, and livestock grazing.  
A loss of  pollinators and their habitat due to development 
is also a threat to this species. 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Blister beetles (Epicauta pennsylvanica) have been noted 
feeding en masse on the flowers of Kremmling milkvetch, 
particularly affecting populations occuring along Muddy 
Creek.  Also, larval bruchine beetles of the genus 
Acanthoscelides may feed upon Kremmling milkvetch 
seeds, as evidenced by pin-sized emergence holes on the 
seed pods. 
Environmental Concerns 
Kremmling milkvetch is known to accumulate selenium 
at toxic levels in its foliage and is known to be a selenium 
indicator plant.  Selenium causes the plant to emit an 
unpleasant pungent odor of garlic or sulfur (a “rotten egg” 
smell), and at high levels is known to be toxic to grazing 
animals.

Pollinators: The abundant nectar of milkweed flowers 
attracts hummingbirds, butterflies, honey bees, native 
bees, and other beneficial insects.  Accordingly, this is a 
wonderful horticultural plant for butterfly gardens, 
borders, meadows, or native plant landscaping.  Milkweed 
plants (Asclepias spp.) are the only larval host for 
monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus).  It is important to 
have large, dense clumps of milkweeds for monarch 
caterpillars.  Monarch, queen (Danaus gilippus) and 
viceroy butterflies (Limenitis archippus) get chemicals 
from the milkweed plant that make them distasteful to 
predators, and all have similar orange and black patterns 
to warn predators. 
Restoration: Showy milkweed s tough, extensive root 
system, drought tolerance, and minimal nutrient 
requirements make it a good species for stabilizing and 
restoring degraded or disturbed sites. 
Ethnobotany: People have used milkweed plants for fiber, 
food, and medicine.  The young shoots, stems, flower 
buds, flowers, and immature fruits of showy milkweed 
were eaten raw or boiled as a vegetable by indigenous 
groups of North America.  The most common use for the

salve for sores.  Seeds were boiled and the liquid used to 
draw the venom from rattlesnake bites.  Tea made from 
the rhizomes was a remedy for measles or coughs.  It was 
also used as a wash to cure rheumatism.  The rhizomes, 
mashed with water, were used as a poultice to reduce 
swelling. 
Fiber: Stem fibers of milkweed are used by Native 
Americans to make course cloth, string, cords, and ropes.  
At Zuni, NM, the silky seed floss is spun into yarn and 
woven into a special fabric for dancers.  Hybrids of A. 
speciosa and A. syriaca are being tested for commercial 
seed floss production as a hypo-allergenic substitute for 
goose down. 
Toxicity: Milkweed contains toxic alkaloids and 
cardenolides, which can cause nausea and vomiting in 
low doses, and death in high doses.  Animals avoid 
milkweed if other forage is available.

Showy milkweed is a member of the milkweed family 
Asclepiadaceae (now placed in Apocynaceae, the 
dogbane family).  Showy milkweed is a native herbaceous 
perennial from widespread rhizomes, which produce 
stems that grow to 1½ to 5 ft tall in summer.  The gray-
green leaves are opposite, 4 to 7 inches long, oval, and 
covered in velvety hairs.  Stems and foliage exude milky 
latex sap when cut.  Flowers are in loose clusters at the 
top of the stems and are rose-purple, aging to yellow.  
Individual Asclepias flowers look like crowns, with the 
corolla (petals) reflexed, and hoods above the corolla.  
Plants flower from May to September.  Thick seed pods 3 
to 5 inches long split down one side in fall to release 
reddish-brown, flat seeds.  Each seed has a tuft of white, 
silky hairs that allows them to be dispersed by wind. 
Showy milkweed grows in well-drained soil in full or 
nearly full sun, in pastures, meadows, forest clearings, 
untilled fields, roadsides, and ditch banks, from sea level 
to 6,250 ft.  For updated distribution, please consult the 
Plant Profile for this species on the PLANTS Web site.

showy milkweed. Showy milkweed has 70,000 to 100,000 
seeds per pound, so sowing at a rate of one pound pure 
live seed per acre will result in 1- 2 seeds per square foot. 
Propagation by rhizome cuttings is easy and reliable.  The 
cuttings should be dug when the plant is dormant 
(generally by October).  Each piece of rhizome should 
have at least one bud.  Plant the rhizomes 4 to 6 inches

Alternate Names 
chamiza, chamise, chamiso, bushy atriplex, fourwing 
shadscale, buckwheat shrub, white greasewood, salt 
sage, wafer sagebrush, box brush 
Uses 
Ornamental and beautification: Its grayish or whitish 
green color has possibilities as an ornamental or 
screening plant in picnic or camping areas in low 
rainfall sites.  The plant has excellent potential for 
plantings to promote native species.  It is used on 
mine spoils, cut banks and other disturbed areas to 
blend into natural vegetation. 
Erosion control: Due to its extensive and deep root 
system (20 to 40 feet deep) this plant has an 
adaptation for erosion control, especially where 
associated native plants have not been disturbed. 
Livestock: This is a nutritious plant.  It has a good 
rating for sheep and goats, fair for cattle, and poor for 
 
 
horses, except in winter when its rating would be fair 
to good.  The seed crop is extremely nutritious and  
 
eaten so extensively by livestock as to be detrimental 
to the continued reproduction of the plant. 
Wildlife: Deer relish this plant, especially during the 
winter.  Quail use this species for shady cover, 
roosting, and food.  It has been observed to be used 
by porcupine, ground squirrel, and jack rabbit. 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s 
current status (e.g. threatened or endangered species, 
state noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
Description 
Atriplex canescens (Pursh) Nutt., fourwing saltbush, 
is an evergreen, much branched, gray shrub from 2 to 
6 feet tall occasionally reaching 10 feet tall.  It has 
stout, gray scurfy branches.  Leaves are alternate, 
linear-spatulate to narrowly oblong, with 1/2 to 2 
inches long margins somewhat enrolled with a dense 
permanent scurf on both sides.  Male and female 
flowers are on separate plants, male flowers in spikes 
forming large panicles, female flowers in spikes 
forming large, dense leafy, spike-like panicles.  
Fruiting bracts have 4, free, flat, entire or fringed 
wings from which the plant gets its name. 
 
 
 
 
Adaptation and Distribution 
Fourwing saltbush is an important species in the 
northern salt desert shrub association.  Average 
annual precipitation in this desert area varies from 6 
to 14 inches but is mostly in the 8 to 12 inch range. 
summers are hot and dry and winters are normally 
cold. Fourwing saltbush grows on a wide range of 
soils from clays to sands.  It does well in soils with 
high lime content.  It can tolerate soil depths from 10 
inches to over 3 feet, but is mostly found in 
moderately deep to deep soils.  It is able to exist on 
soils with heavy white or black alkali concentrations 
but is not restricted to saline-alkali areas and is by no 
means an indicator of these conditions.  The plant is 
found in desert flats, gravelly washes, mesas, ridges, 
slopes, and even on sand dunes.  It can grow at 
elevations from 3,000 to as high as 8,000 feet, but is 
most likely to be found at 4,500 to 6,000 feet. 
 
Fourwing saltbrush is distributed throughout the 
western United States.  For a current distribution 
map, please consult the Plant Profile page for this 
species on the PLANTS Website.

Establishment 
The seedbed should be weed free and firm.  Drilling 
is the most successful seeding method but some 
success has occurred from broadcasting where some 
method of covering has been employed.  Seed should 
be covered no deeper than 1 inch.  Seedings have 
been successful throughout the year but best results 
are obtained by seeding in late spring or early 
summer.  Good stands have been obtained by seeding 
during the winter as late as January.  Seeding rate 
should be 8 to 10 pounds per acre.  De-wing the seed 
with a hammer mill improves the ease of handling 
and enhances germination.  Poor stands may result if 
seed is not de-winged. 
Seed ripens in late August and September and can be 
collected from September to December by stripping it 
from dense clusters.  They can be stored successfully 
and remain viable for 6 or 7 years.  Some 
transplanting of 2 or 3 year old nursery stock has 
been tried but has not been successful. 
Management 
Planted areas should be kept free of weeds during the 
first year of establishment.  Proper grazing use on 
this shrub should be 40% of the total annual growth 
during the growing period and 50% during the plant 
dormancy period.  This plant is well adapted to 
winter use.  Careful management is needed due to the 
brittle nature of the twigs.  A rotation deferred system 
of grazing will aid this plant in producing a 
maximum yield of forage for livestock.  
As a screening plant, this species has a place on drier 
locations.  However. it should not be seeded in heavy 
foot, horseback, or vehicle travel areas where it 
would soon be killed due to its brittle nature.  In 
heavy winter deer concentration areas, this plant will 
be grazed out if additional food sources are not 
provided. 
 
 
 
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
There are no serious pests of fourwing saltbush.  
Rabbits and other small rodents are especially 
damaging to small seedlings.

Alternate Names

Uses 
Erosion control: Black mangrove is valuable in restoring 
brackish and salt water marshes due to its ability to filter 
and trap sediments.  Mangrove forests, which include 
black mangrove, have a high capacity as a sink for excess 
nutrients and pollutants.  It also mixes well with other 
native plants to reduce wave energy.  
 
Wildlife: Black mangrove serves as nursery habitat for 
crustaceans and fish.  Mangrove detritus (dead leaves and 
twigs) in water feeds microorganisms that provide food 
for young marine life.  It is estimated that as much as 80% 
of the organic budget of bays in Florida came from the 
surrounding mangrove forests. Black mangrove serves as 
nesting habitat for many coastal birds including brown 
pelicans.  
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g. threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
 
Description and Adaptation 
Black mangrove is a subtropical woody shrub that grows 
in salt marshes.  Mangroves are very hardy and have 
become adapted to harsh environments where water and 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
salinity levels fluctuate.  Pneumatophores, or breather 
roots, form a network that collects silt and debris, and 
controls erosion.  Pneumatophores are a major adaptation 
to the stresses of intertidal habitat.  They allow root 
respiration in anaerobic, waterlogged soils.  The 
pneumatophores are also excellent nursery areas for 
crustaceans in the marsh plant community.  The height of 
black mangrove in Louisiana varies from 4 to 9 feet.  In 
Florida, individual trees can reach 60 feet, but are usually 
much shorter.  Leaves are 1 to 5 inches long, elliptical, 
opposite, thick, leathery, dark green, glabrous (smooth) 
above, and grayish with a tight felt-like pubescence 
beneath.  Glands on the underside secrete salt.  Clusters of 
small sessile flowers with white petals, approximately ½ 
inch in diameter, are borne in the leaf axils and growing 
tips on the twigs.  The fruit are flat, approximately 1 inch 
long, dark green and glabrous beneath a velvety pericarp.  
The bark on the black mangrove is thick, dark brown or 
blackish, with rough irregular flattened scales.  Twigs are 
grayish in color and smooth, with enlargements at the 
joints.    
 
Black mangrove is adapted to sub-tropical and tropical 
coastal intertidal zones along the Gulf of Mexico.  The 
spatial distribution across the intertidal zone for black 
mangrove, red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle), and white 
mangrove (Laguncularia racemosa) suggests differential 
flooding tolerance among these species.  Black mangrove 
penetrates farthest inland into brackish water and farthest 
north of the mangrove species.  Black mangrove is able to 
regulate its internal salt concentration and grow in a wild 
range of salinities, but its ability to increase leaf area is 
limited under high salinity.  At Bay Champagne near 
Fourchon, Louisiana, three vegetation zones were 
delineated in a mangal/salt marsh community: a zone 
adjacent to the bay and dominated by black mangrove, an 
inland zone dominated by cordgrass (Spartina 
alterniflora), and a zone between the two containing both 
species.  
Black mangrove is a valuable component of the 
marsh ecosystem.  This plant is susceptible to freezing 
and the native range can be changed drastically by hard 
winters.   
 
Distribution: Black mangrove is native to the southern 
U.S., tropical America, and Africa.  Please consult the 
Plant Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
site. 
 
Establishment 
Black mangrove grows in the intertidal zone throughout 
the Gulf of Mexico.  It will establish in nature from seed 
that floats and can travel some distance on the tides.  Seed 
will germinate quickly and establish young seedlings in

good habitat.  Mangrove communities will often 
reestablish by natural volunteer propagule recruitment if 
natural hydrologic patterns are restored.  
 
Black mangrove may be propagated in the nursery from 
wild collected seed.  Seed collected in the wild will not 
survive more than three to four weeks.  Freshly collected 
seed should be soaked in water, the pericarp removed and 
the seed planted into plastic pots with any commercial 
potting soil.  Various sizes of tubes and pots have been 
used with success.  Germination and rooting normally 
occurs within two weeks of planting.  Plants can be 
maintained in fresh water tanks that hold moisture at the 
bottom of the pots.  One to two year old seedlings (18 
inches tall) have been transplanted with great success to 
provide land stabilization and establish wildlife and 
marine habitats.  The greater the root mass (not root 
bound pots) the greater the chance of successful out 
planting.  The Florida Department of Natural Resources 
obtained excellent survival and growth by transplanting 
19 to 59 inches tall seedlings, with a rootball diameter 
equal to one-half the tree height.  Pruning seedlings just 
before or after transplanting enhances recovery and 
increases growth rate.  Plant the seedlings in areas where 
the tidal flow will cover and uncover the root collar. 
Various water depths promote extensive root systems, but 
seedlings do not become established until water depth is 
reduced to 2 inches or less.  Plantings in areas of high 
wave energy may have to be protected or anchored until 
the root system is capable of supporting the plant.   
 
Management 
There are no data on managing native black mangrove 
stands.  In the Gulf of Mexico the range of black 
mangrove is “managed” by the winter weather.   
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
There are no known pests that could threaten black 
mangrove stands in the wild. 
 
Environmental Concerns 
Black mangrove is a valuable component of the intertidal 
ecosystem.  Loss of black mangrove is a concern as it is a 
woody species that persists and assists in habitat 
development and in breaking wave energy and it provides 
nesting habitat for birds. 
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
The USDA NRCS Plant Materials Centers have released 
one variety.  Pelican Germplasm black mangrove is a pre-
varietal release from the Golden Meadow Plant Materials 
Center, Galliano, Louisiana.  This germplasm was 
selected to provide a plant for soil conservation in 
brackish and salt water marshes.

Description and Adaptation  
Burningbush is an introduced, erect, annual forb.  The 
simple, alternately arranged leaves are linear to narrowly 
ovate to 2 inches (5.5 cm) long and can have hairs, 
depending on age.  Leaves are very short petioled or 
sessile.  Stems are green, red tinged, or red depending on 
age.  The flowers are green leaf-like bracts. It has a spike.  
Burningbush has small fruits with an oval, brown to black 
seed.  Burningbush varies widely in morphological 
characters partially due the environment where it is found.  
  
Burningbush is native to central and eastern Europe and 
Asia.  Burningbush can be found in a very wide range of 
temperatures and climatic regions throughout the world, 
but is particularly adapted to arid and semi-arid regions.  
Burningbush is common in rangelands, pastures, fields, 
disturbed sites, gardens, roadsides, ditchbanks, and in 
soils with high salinity.  It can be found in areas with as 
little as 6 inches (15.24 cm) of annual rainfall.

For updated distribution, please consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site.  
  
Establishment  
Soil should be plowed or disked and weed free. Planting 
should be done late April to early May.  Liming of the 
soil to a pH of 6.0 is recommended. Nitrogen should be 
applied before planting and topdressing the remainder 
later depending on the anticipated yield.  Planting can be 
done by drilling or broadcast planting by hand or by 
airplane.  
  
Management  
Burningbush is palatable to all classes of livestock.  It can 
be toxic to livestock and may cause death if consumed in 
large quantities.  It is recommended that burningbush 
forage should consist of not more than 50% of livestock 
ration.  Burningbush stands can be grazed by livestock 
directly or it can be cut for hay or silage.  Care should be 
taken to prevent poisoning.  
 
Pests and Potential Problems  
Burningbush may be host to various fungi, pathogens, and 
insects, some of which can be detrimental to crops like 
sugarbeet, potatoes, and tobacco. Grasses will out 
compete burningbush.  Volunteer burningbush is likely to 
be a problem in crops that are planted following 
burningbush.  
  
Environmental Concerns  
Burningbush is highly invasive and is able to establish 
and persist in harsh environments where other plants are 
limited.  Burningbush may be hard to control once it is 
established in an area.

General:  Horsefly weed is an upright, multi-
stemmed, warm season, shrubby perennial.  It 
typically grows 2 – 3 feet tall. It is a member of the 
pea (Fabaceae) family which reproduces by seed or 
rhizomes.  The dark grayish green leaves emerge in 
April and remain on the plant through October.  The 
smooth leaves have three leaflets or lobes radiating 
from a common point.   All parts of the plant will 
turn black when dried.  Depending on the region, it 
will flower in May (in the south) through September 
(in the north).  It has showy, bright yellow flowers 
which are about ½ inch long.  There is a lot of flower 
color variation, from cream to clear yellow.  The 4 -5 
inch long terminal elongated cluster of flowers 
contain both male and female parts.  Flowers give 
way to ½” long inflated seed pods which turn black 
when ripe.  The seeds rattle around in the pods giving 
its other common name “rattle weed”.  In the autumn 
when fully mature, the plant turns silvery-grey and 
breaks off from the root system at ground level.  The 
pods stay with the plant for some time while the wind 
tumbles it around to new locations.    
 
Distribution: Horsefly weed is the most widely 
distributed of the wild indigoes. from southeastern 
Canada west to Minnesota and south to Florida 
(USDA plant cold hardiness zones 3-9).  For current 
distribution, please consult the Plant Profile page for 
this species on the PLANTS Web site.

HOARY ALYSSUM 
 Berteroa incana (L.) DC.  
Plant Symbol = BEIN2 
Contributed by: USDA NRCS Plant Materials Program 
 
Photo by James Jacobs, USDA NRCS, Bozeman, MT  
 
Caution: This plant is weedy and may be invasive.  
 
Alternate Names:  
Alyssum incanum, False hoary madwort, hoary berteroa.  
 
Uses: The continuously blooming flowers are considered 
attractive to open areas and around gardens. It is used as 
vegetative cover in mining and municipal wastelands in 
the Ukraine and Germany.  
 
Status:  
Hoary alyssum is an aggressive invader in fields of 
alfalfa, clover, or birdsfoot trefoil and is listed as a state 
noxious weed in some states. Please consult the PLANTS 
Web site and your local NRCS Field Office, Cooperative 
Extension Service office, or state natural resource or 
agriculture department regarding its status and use.  
 
Description:  
Berteroa incana (L.) DC., hoary alyssum, a member of 
the mustard family, is an annual to short-lived perennial 
forb native to east-central Europe and western Asia. It has 
a slender tap root, star-shaped hairs on the stems, leaves, 
sepals, and seed pods, and four white, notched petals on 
flowers clustered at the stem tips. It is invasive along 
roads, railroads, trails, and gravelly stream and lake 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
banks, in lawns, farmyards, vacant lots, overgrazed 
pastures and rangeland, and in hay meadows.  
 
Adaptation:  
Hoary alyssum is adapted to the temperate continental 
climate characterized by cold winters and hot dry 
summers, but is found throughout much of the US. Fall 
seedlings and rosettes are resistant to winterkill, and 
flowering plants are resistant to summer drought. It grows 
well on sandy or gravelly soils with poor soil fertility, and 
is most prolific on dry, disturbed open sites. It is 
commonly found on limestone and calcareous substrata 
and less so on acidic soils.  
 
Establishment:  
Seeds can germinate from early spring to late fall, limited 
mainly by open space and water. Seedlings establishing in 
early July or sooner can flower and produce seed by early 
fall. Seedlings establishing in late July or later will remain 
as rosettes and produce flowers and seeds the following 
year.  
 
Management:  
Please contact your local agricultural extension specialist 
or county weed specialist to learn what works best in your 
area and how to use it safely. Always read label and 
safety instructions for each control method. Trade names 
and control measures appear in this document only to 
provide specific information.  USDA, NRCS does not 
guarantee or warranty the products and control methods 
named, and other products may be equally effective.  
 
Hoary alyssum is controlled using 2, 4-D applied at label 
rates. Spring applications when plants are actively 
growing and prior to bolting will be most effective. 
Repeated applications will be needed to target plants 
regenerating from the seed bank. Reports indicate 
metsulfuron applied at 0.5 ounce product per acre will 
control hoary alyssum. Other sulfonylurea herbicides 
including chlorsulfuron, and trisulfuron products as well 
as dicamba, and imazapic products may also be effective. 
Hand pulling that removes the root crown is effective. 
Mowing will not control hoary alyssum and may increase 
infestations by cutting down a shading canopy and 
spreading seed pods. Regular, repeated mowing to a six-
inch stubble height may reduce seed production when 
combined with irrigation and nutrient management to 
increase the vigor of desired plants. Shallow tilling that 
severs the tap root below the root crown will kill hoary 
alyssum plants. However, this type of disturbance will 
favor hoary alyssum regeneration from the seed bank. 
There are no biological control insects available for 
management of hoary alyssum.

Pests and Potential Problems:  
See environmental concerns  
 
Environmental Concerns:.  
Hoary alyssum decreases forage value because the woody 
stems of mature plants are low in crude protein and 
digestible carbohydrates. Contamination of 30% or more 
of forage with hoary alyssum is toxic to horses causing 
laminitis, limb edema, diarrhea, intravascular haemolysis, 
and hypovolemic shock. The ability of hoary alyssum to 
persist under dry conditions and its continuous flowering 
and fruiting enables it to compete with native plants on 
range and wildlands and reduce biodiversity. In 
Minnesota it has been implicated in the reduction in 
species richness of pollinator communities because it 
attracted a minimal number of pollinating insects.

Attention to weed control is the most critical factor 
for rapid establishment and early growth of riparian 
buffers.  Grass competition for moisture, nutrients 
and light is generally more critical than broadleaf 
weed pressure, however there are broadleaved weeds 
that are serious threats--these are the very large 
annuals and the spreading perennials.  
The use of selected herbicides or a weed control 
fabric are two ways to reduce weed competition.  
State land grant college weed control guidelines for 
herbicide use should be reviewed for application rates 
and species compatibility.  Consider the grass control 
herbicides which allow application contact with tree 
and shrub species.  
Weed control fabric can be placed at planting time

much greater volume of forage than blue grama, and

Planting may be done by either drilling or 
broadcasting, with the seed being sown no more than 
1/4 to 1/2 inches deep at a rate of 1 to 3 pounds 
PLS/acre.  Seeding in late spring is recommended in 
the Great Plains. earlier seeding is recommended in 
areas further south.  In the Southwest, seeding should 
be done during the period from June 15 to July 15.  
Mulching and irrigation is recommended on harsh 
sites.  Soil tests should be made to test the soils for 
deficiencies.  Blue grama will tolerate low-nutrient 
soils better than acidic conditions.  Planting should be 
done by a native grass seed drill.  In western areas 
plant blue grama in a sorghum cover crop, stubble, or 
in with the crop itself.

Once the grass is established, it is very palatable to

close grazing.  For best yields, defer grazing during 
the growing season every 2 to 3 years.  Blue grama 
cures well on stem, making it a good grass for 
grazing during the dormant season.  Renovation of 
sodbound stands is also recommended.  Weeds can 
be controlled by use of herbicides, mowing or 
controlled grazing.

UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_Description=':  California brome is a native, cool-
season, annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial 
bunchgrass.  It is a highly variable species.  The base 
of this robust plant is very open with coarse, erect to
 
spreading stems (culms) that grow 45-120 cm tall. 
Leaf blades are 1-12 mm wide, lax and spread out 
along stems.  The inflorescence (seed head , panicle) 
is 10-30 cm long, large, open, and erect to somewhat 
d
rooping.  The root system is deep and widespread.  
 
Key to identification: California brome intergrades 
with mountain brome and some authors classify b
as the same species.  Other species are also very 
difficult to distinguish from California brome so a 
current taxonomic key should be consulted.  Sitka 
brome (Bromus sitchensis) is a good example and
 
their natural habitats overlap considerably.  Both 
occur in full sun, but Sitka brome can also be found
 
in somewhat shadier environments.  According to 
some taxonomists, Sitka brome is taller with broader, 
more drooping panicles and spikelets (subunits o
f the 
seedhead) that occur more toward the tip of the 
branchlets compared to California brome.  Pacific 
brome (Bromus pacificus) can also be confused with 
both bromes, but its leaves are soft hairy (on at leas
t 
one side) and it has other distinguishing features.  
Pacific brome occurs mainly along the Pacific Co
in moist habitats but extends inland to the Pug

mixture with alfalfa, the alternate row method will 
give the best results.  For seed production plantings 
under irrigation, seed in rows 30 to 42 inches apart at

not be grazed prior to smooth brome attaining a 
minimum height of about 10 inches at the beginning

UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_Description_='Columbia brome is a cool season 
perennial bunchgrass that is short to medium lived 
depending on growing conditions.  The base is 
loosely clumped and non-rhizomatous although 
rooting may (rarely) occur from lower nodes along 
the stems (culms).  The culms are 45-120 cm tall and 
erect to spreading, often with hairy nodes (joints).  
Inflorescences (seedheads or panicles) are 8-22 cm 
long, spreading to drooping, typically with the 
slender, compressed spikelets (subunits of the 
seedhead) all hanging in the same direction. Leaves 
are course textured (5-12 mm wide), often hairy on at 
least one side, basal to part way up the stems, lax, 
and flat.   
 
Key to identification:  Despite the typical hairy nodes 
and uniform orientation of the drooping seedheads, 
Columbia brome is difficult to distinguish from three 
other native bromes that occur in the western US, 
often in similar habitats: fringed brome (Bromus 
ciliatus), Orcutt’s brome (Bromus orcuttianus), and 
woodland or Chinook brome (Bromus laevipes).  
Refer to a botanical key for detailed descriptions of 
traits and proper identification. It should not be 
confused with false brome (Brachypodium 
sylvaticum), a weedy and invasive introduced grass 
that also grows in woodland situations. The spikelets 
of both species noticeably droop, but on Columbia 
brome they are clearly stalked (i.e. on short 
branchlets) and on false brome they are not.

UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_Adaptation_='  Columbia brome is widely distributed 
in the western US and Canada from sea level to an 
elevation of 6500 ft. In the US it occurs from 
Washington south to California and west to Montana, 
Wyoming, and Utah.  It strongly prefers shaded 
habitats including woodland edges and the floor of 
hardwood and coniferous forest types. Survival in 
open areas appears more limited to ravines, north 
facing slopes, seepage areas, and montane meadows.    
 
Soil adaptation varies from volcanic ash to deep, 
moderately well and well drained sandy loams, 
loams, silts, and clays that are moderately acid to 
slightly alkaline (pH 5.4 to 7.9) with generally rich 
nutrient regimes.  The species is found in disturbed 
environments such as along streams and in clearcuts, 
as well as in mature undisturbed forests. In natural 
settings, response to fire varies with litter dryness and 
intensity of burn, but is generally considered neutral

recommended. No special physical conditioning of 
the seed is required for use in a drill or broadcast 
seeder, but removal of the awn (linear appendage) 
and minute hair from the seed improves seed flow in 
some equipment.     
 
Establishment rate from seed is moderately fast after 
germination.  There are approximately 95,000 (+/- 
20%) seeds per pound with seed hulls intact and 
108,000 seeds per pound with hulls removed (naked 
seed).   Therefore, each 1 pound of live seed sown 
per acre is equivalent to approximately 2 to 2.5 live 
seeds per square foot.  Sown alone, a suggested 
minimum seeding rate is 15-20 lbs of pure live seed 
(PLS) per acre for general revegetation.  
 
When grown for seed, fields should be situated on the 
north side of tall windbreaks or in other wooded 
settings to receive partial shade. Good soil fertility 
and drainage are needed.  Burning for post harvest 
residue management is not recommended at this time.  
Hulls often separate from the seed and seed may be 
damaged during mechanical harvest with a combine.  
Stands are typically variable and frequently short 
lived.  Management requirements for livestock 
utilization are not well reported but may approach 
those of other native bromes provided there is partial 
shade.

establishment, and certain climatic uncertainties.  All 
planting should be delayed until the danger of frost 
has past.  The time of planting depends upon the 
latitude of the location, and may extend to August 1 
in lower latitudes. 
Buffalograss can be established from pieces of sod or 
sod plugs.  Sod should be planted on a well prepared 
seedbed in 18-inch rows.  Sod should be spaced from 
6 inches to 2 feet apart. plugs should be planted on 12 
to 24 inch centers depending on how quickly a 
complete cover is desired.  When planting, dig a hole 
deep enough to set a plant in with the grass blades 
above the ground.  Pack soil around the sod making 
sure not to cover with soil because the plant will die.  
Once planted, the sod should be watered for about 3 
weeks to ensure root establishment. 
Sprigs should be planted into soil that has been tilled 
to a depth of 4 to 6 inches.  Sprigging rate should be 
approximately 240 bushels of sprigs per acre, planted 
to a depth of 1 inch or less.  A planted site should be 
rolled to ensure good sprig-soil contact and irrigated 
within 3 hours after planting.  Newly planted areas 
will also require irrigation for several weeks to 
maintain a moist environment for root establishment. 
Proper seedbed preparation for planting a home lawn 
is essential.  Buffalograss will grow on heavy and 
compacted soils, but it is easier to start and maintain 
on good loam soils.  Heavy soils may be improved by 
applying good quality organic matter such as peat 
moss, aged manure, or compost.  Applying a 
phosphorus fertilizer stimulates seedling root growth, 
even on soils testing high in phosphorus.  Work the 
soil to a depth of 4 to 6 inches.  This may require 
plowing, discing, or tilling.  The seedbed should be 
uniform, friable, and well-packed.  Use tillage 
methods to control any weeds that may develop 
before seeding.

applications of nitrogen.  Over- fertilization will 
promote undesirable grasses within the planted area.

Caution: This plant may become invasive. 
Alternate Names 
Alternative common names:  Butterfly bush, orange eye, 
summer lilac, purple buddleja, red buddleja 
 
Alternative scientific names:  Buddleia, Buddleja 
variabilis Hemsl. 
Uses 
Ornamental: Orange eye butterflybush has been used in 
the nursery trade for over a hundred years due to its 
pleasant weeping, grey-green foliage and fragrant, 
colorful blooms that attract butterflies, hummingbirds and 
other floral visitors.  Because it can become invasive and 
crowd out desirable native vegetation, sterile varieties or 
hybrids should be chosen when installing new plantings.     
Status 
Orange eye butterflybush is listed as a Class B noxious 
weed in Washington, and in Oregon is a list B designated 
weed, subject to quarantine.  As of January 1, 2010, any 
plant listed as ‘butterfly bush’ is assumed to be B. davidii 
and is prohibited entry, transport, purchase, sale or 
propagation in the State of Oregon.  Sterile varieties of 
Buddleja approved by the Oregon Dept. of Agriculture, 
including inter-specific hybrids, are not regulated and 
may be propagated and sold if labeled as follows:

your State Department of Natural Resources for this 
plant’s current status (e.g., threatened or endangered 
species, state noxious status, and wetland indicator 
values). 
Weediness 
This plant establishes readily from seed and stem 
fragments in disturbed or natural areas, especially riparian 
zones, where it can form dense thickets that outcompete 
native vegetation.  Seed can be produced the first year, is 
spread easily by wind and water, and can remain viable in 
the seed bank for three to five years.  Plants are difficult 
to remove once established as they will readily resprout 
from the root crown after the stems are cut.  Please 
consult with your local NRCS Field Office, Cooperative 
Extension Service office, state natural resource, or state 
agriculture department regarding its status and use.  Weed 
information is also available from the PLANTS Web site 
at http://plants.usda.gov.  Please consult the Related Web 
Sites on the Plant Profile for this species for further 
information. 
Description and Adaptation 
Orange eye butterflybush is a non-native, deciduous to 
semi-evergreen shrub that grows 6–16 feet tall and 4–15 
feet wide.  The leaves are egg- to lance-shaped, up to 10 
inches long, green above and grayish, soft-woolly below, 
growing oppositely on long, arching stems that are green 
when young and have peeling, gray-brown bark when 
older.  Tiny, tubular, four-petaled flowers are arranged in 
large, cone-shaped clusters 3–18 inches long that bloom 
from late spring to first frost in fall.  Flowers are generally 
purplish with a yellow to orange throat, though 
horticultural varieties range from white or yellow to pink 
and deep purple.   
Butterflybush is hardy to -20°F (USDA zones 5–10) and 
prefers moist, well-drained soils in partial to full-sun, 
although it is fairly drought-tolerant once established.  
Roots generally don’t survive in saturated soil.  
Ornamental escapes establish on roadsides, railroad 
tracks, stream and river banks, dryland meadows, dunes, 
coastal forest edges and logged areas, surface mined 
lands, industrial yards and other disturbed areas.  
Native to China, this shrub has been spread widely 
through the horticultural trade and become naturalized in 
many parts of North America, including the pacific 
northwest, northeast, Hawaii and Puerto Rico (see map 
below), as well as western Europe, southeastern Australia 
and New Zealand.  For updated distribution, please

further invasion.  To remove established shrubs, stems 
should be cut off at the base and disposed of properly, and 
then a general use herbicide such as glyphosate or 
triclopyr can be applied to the freshly-cut stump to 
prevent regrowth.  Alternately, infested areas can be 
fenced and browsed by goats for 3-4 years to attain 
acceptable control as part of an integrated pest 
management program.  Two biological control agents are 
being used on an experimental basis in New Zealand, but 
have not yet been tested or approved for use in the US: 
the weevil Cleopus japonicas, whose adults and larvae 
consume butterflybush leaves, and the stem boring beetle, 
Mecyslobus erro.  Please contact your local agricultural 
extension specialist or county weed specialist to learn 
what works best in your area and how to use it safely.  
Always read label and safety instructions for each control 
method.  Trade names and control measures appear in this 
document only to provide specific information.  USDA 
NRCS does not guarantee or warranty the products and

Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
There are over a hundred Buddleja varieties or hybrids 
that are widely available from commercial sources.  As of

Database. 
 
Establishment 
Plants can be started easily in the spring from seed, 
container stock or cuttings.  Plants should be given 
sufficient space in the garden as they grow rapidly and 
can shade out neighbors.  They may need summer 
watering in drier climates the first couple of years, but 
most varieties are drought-hardy once established.  There 
are approximately 143,000 seeds per pound.   
Management 
In gardens and yards, flowers should be deadheaded 
before they produce fruits to prolong bloom and prevent 
seeds from establishing in undesirable areas.  In warmer 
climates (USDA zones 8–10) where the shrubs don’t die 
back to the ground during winter, the weeping side 
branches should be pruned in the spring to encourage new 
growth and larger, more prolific blooms.  In cold climates 
(USDA zones 5 and 6), mulch plants in the fall and cut 
back to about a foot high in late winter.  Cut branches 
must be disposed of properly (burned or composted) to 
ensure they don’t sprout into new plants.   
Pests and Potential Problems 
Orange eye butterflybush generally has few pests, but can 
be susceptible to spider mites, caterpillars, weevils, 
mullein moth, fungal leaf spot and dieback, especially 
during drought or stress.   
Environmental Concerns 
Dense thickets of butterflybush can crowd out native 
vegetation and disrupt natural succession patterns on 
forests after logging or burns, and on riverbanks and 
sandbars following floods.  Plants buried by up to 1.5 feet 
of fine sand in a flood can survive by sprouting new roots 
and shoots from buried stems, thus aiding their rapid 
recovery and dominance of early succession riparian 
communities. 
Control 
Seedlings and small plants can be hand-picked or dug out, 
though this soil disturbance can also create sites for

AMERICAN 
BEAUTYBERRY 
Callicarpa americana L. 
Plant Symbol = CAAM2 
Contributed by: USDA NRCS NRCS East Texas Plant 
Materials Center 
 
Jeff McMillian@USDA-NRCS PLANTS 
 
Alternate Names 
American beautyberry is also known as French mulberry, 
sourbush, bunchberry, or purple beauty-berry. In Greek, 
the genus name Callicarpa means callos, “beauty” and 
carpos “fruit”. 
 
Uses 
Ethnobotanic: The roots, leaves, and branches were used 
by various Native American tribes for medicinal purposes 
to treat malarial fevers and rheumatism. The roots were 
used to treat dizziness, stomachaches and dysentery.  
Roots and berries were boiled and drunk to treat colic. 
 
In the early 20th century, farmers would crush the leaves 
and place them under the harnesses of horses and mules to 
repel mosquitoes. The farmers rubbed the crushed leaves 
on themselves to repel mosquitoes and biting bugs. 
Studies conducted by the Agricultural Research Service 
has shown two compounds – callicarpenal and 
intermedeol - are responsible for the repellant. 
 
Wildlife: The fruit is high in moisture content and is an 
important food source for more than forty species of 
songbirds including the American Robin, Brown 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
Thrasher, Purple Finch, and Eastern Towhee. The drupes 
or clusters are eaten by armadillo, foxes, opossum, 
raccoon and squirrels. White tailed deer consume the fruit 
in the fall after leaf drop. They also browse the leaves in 
summer when highly preferred foods are not available. 
Protein content of the leaves ranges from 18 percent in 
spring to 8 percent in fall. 
 
Other: American beautyberry is used as an ornamental 
shrub in mass plantings, borders and container planting. 
 
Livestock: Cattle browse the twigs in winter and the 
leaves and twigs in the spring. 
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site. 
http://plants.usda.gov  and your State Department of 
Natural Resources for this plant’s current status (e.g., 
threatened or endangered species, state noxious status, 
and wetland indicator values). 
 
Description and Adaptation 
American beautyberry is a fast growing native perennial 
shrub. growing five to eight feet tall and almost as wide 
with drooping branches. The elliptical to ovate shaped 
leaves have an opposite arrangement with saw toothed 
margins. The underside of the leaves may be covered with 
wooly like hairs. The stems are slender, gray to reddish 
brown, and terete or four sided. In late spring to early 
summer, inconspicuous flowers of blue, violet, pink, or 
white are arranged in clusters on the stems between the 
leaves. In August or September, clusters of small purple 
to blue berries or drupes encircle the woody stems. Each 
small berry in the cluster contains two to four seeds about 
1/16 in. long. 
 
This plant is distributed throughout the southeastern 
United States from Texas and Oklahoma east to 
Maryland. It also grows in the Caribbean and northern 
Mexico. American beautyberry is found in woods, 
particularly on moist areas under open pine canopies, 
thickets, right of ways, and fence rows. It is adapted to 
moist, loam, sandy or shallow upland sites and a wide pH 
range. The shrub is considered a pioneer species and is 
characteristic of the mid stages of plant succession. This 
plant is very tolerant of fire. However, it is intolerant of 
deep shade and declines in number when mid-story 
vegetation is dense.

Establishment 
American beautyberry can be propagated by transplanting 
volunteer plants, softwood cuttings, or seeds. Volunteer 
plants are very hearty and can be dug up and transplanted 
to a different location. Softwood stem cuttings (4” to 6” 
long) can be taken in the summer and fall. Dip the cut end 
into indol -3 – butyric acid (IBA. 1000 ppm) and insert 
into a rooting media. Keep the temperature of the media 
between 70-750. Water the cuttings and cover with plastic 
to keep the material moist. Roots should develop within a 
few weeks. After rooting begins, remove the plastic at 
longer intervals each day for seven to ten days. 
Afterwards, remove the plastic permanently. The seed is 
easily gathered by hand picking the mature fruit in the 
fall. The harvested berries, which contain 2 to 4 seeds 
each, can be treated in several ways. one is planting the 
berries in the fall for spring germination. American 
beautyberry seeds can survive several years in the soil 
bank. Another way is cleaning the seeds using a kitchen 
blender for small seedlots. Mix the berries with at least 
five times their volume of water and pour into the 
blender. Run the blender at its lowest speed using short 
bursts of a few seconds at a time to separate the skin and 
tissue from the seeds. Eventually, mature seeds sink to the 
bottom, while immature seeds, skins and tissue remain 
near the top. Check the seeds for possible damage. Pour 
off the unwanted material and repeat the process two or 
three times. Eventually, a clean seed sample will be left at 
the bottom of the blender. Drain the seeds and spread 
them out to dry. After drying, the seeds are ready for 
planting or storage in a cool, dry place. 
Management 
Prune the plants in the fall or winter to maintain its form. 
Cut away the old stems since the berries are present only 
on new growth. 
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Some of the diseases which affect this genus include leaf 
spots (Atractilina callicarpae) and black mold (Meliola 
cookeana). 
 
Environmental Concerns 
American  beautyberry  seed  is  dispersed  by  birds  and 
animals.

UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_DescriptionandAdaptation='Trumpet-creeper Family (Bignoniaceae).  It is a 
perennial deciduous tree which readily grows in 
USDA Hardiness Zones 5 to 9.  This is a U.S. native.  
At maturity, the height can vary from about 25 to 40 
feet.  Catalpas prefer moist, deep, well drained soil, 
but adapts to dry or wet soils.  The soil pH may range 
from 5.5 to 7.0.  It prefers an open sunny space to 
partial shade.   The crown is often forked.  Its 
longevity is about 40 to 50 years. 
 
The tree bark is separated into irregular shallow 
fissures with reddish-brown scales.  On young tree 
seedlings the bark is thin and easily damaged by 
impact, or rodents. 
 
Twigs in winter have a unique identifying 
characteristic.  They have sunken leaf scars which 
resemble suction cups.  Their whorled arrangement 
of 3 “moon crater” scars per node is another trait 
easily identified.  They are grayish-brown in color. 
 
Leaves are simple, may be opposite or whorled (3 per 
node), pinnately veined, 5 to 12 inches long , 4 to 6 
inches broad, heart shaped at the base, and have a 
long petiole with entire margins and soft pubescence 
on the underside, which is also a lighter green than 
the top surface.  
 
The flowers of catalpa are perfect.  Flowering takes 
place from May through July.  They occur in bell-
shaped corollas of 5 lobes.   Individual flowers are 
showy, with the 5 petals in each flower being unequal 
in size, white with purple spots and orange stripes at 
the throat, in branched, upright clusters.  The petals 
are up to 1.5 inches long. 
 
Seedpods are slender and green in the summer 
growing from 6 to 24 inches long, and ½ inch wide 
looking ‘cigar like’.  They mature in the autumn, turn 
brown, split open lengthwise to let seeds fall in the 
spring.  The seedpod generally stays attached to the 
tree limb over winter. 
 
It was first cultivated in 1726.  It was originally 
found in the Gulf Coast states of Florida, Georgia, 
Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana.  It has since 
spread to many states east of the Rocky Mountains.

American hornbeam is planted in landscapes and 
naturalized areas.  It prefers deep, fertile, moist, 
acidic soil and grows best in partial shade, but will 
grow in full sun.  Its chief liabilities in cultivation are 
a relatively slow growth rate and difficulty in 
transplantation.  It is not drought-tolerant. 
 
Seeds, buds, or catkins are eaten by a number of 
songbirds, ruffed grouse, ring-necked pheasants, 
bobwhite, turkey, fox, and gray squirrels.  
Cottontails, beaver, and white-tailed deer eat the 
leaves, twigs, and larger stems.  American hornbeam 
is heavily used by beaver, because it is readily 
available in typical beaver habitat.

usually smooth, with smooth, longitudinal fluting 
(resembling a flexed muscle).  Its leaves are 
deciduous, arranged alternately along stems, egg-
shaped to elliptical in outline, ¾ to 4¾ inches long, 
with doubly-serrate edges.  They are glabrous above, 
slightly to moderately pubescent beneath, especially 
on major veins, with or without conspicuous dark 
glands.  During the growing season, leaves are dark 
green but turn yellow to orange or red in the fall.  The 
flowers are unisexual, in catkins.  The male catkins 
are 1 to 2½ inches long, female catkins are somewhat 
shorter.  Both types occur on the same plant).  Fruits 
are nutlets surrounded by a 3-winged, narrow, leaf-

American hornbeam begins to produce seeds at about 
15 years and peaks at 25 to 50 years, probably 
ceasing at about 75 years.  Large seed crops are 
produced at 3-5-year intervals.  Seeds are mainly 
dispersed by birds.  Seed establishment will occur on 
leaf litter in deep shade.  Flooding, drought, damping 
off, proximity to an adult of the same species, and 
herbivory are important causes of mortality for first-
year seedlings.  Reproduction also may occur by 
sprouts from the root crown and by root sprouts, 
although the latter apparently is not common.   
 
American hornbeam is best suited to establishment in 
bottomlands that have already been stabilized by 
pioneer species.  It is shade-tolerant and persists in 
the understory of mature plant communities.  Shade 
tolerance declines with age and American hornbeam 
is likely to become dominant, with other subcanopy

quickly eliminate the species.  The wood rots very

Wildlife Value: Prairie sandreed provides fair forage 
for grazing and browsing wildlife in early spring and 
summer. The plants forage value increases in 
importance in late fall and winter as the plant cures 
well on the stem and provides upright and accessible 
forage. Seeds are used by songbirds and small 
rodents. 
 
Erosion Control: The rhizomatous growth habit and 
extensive fibrous root system of this species makes it 
an excellent stabilizer of sandy sites.

UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_='Description and Adaptation 
Prairie sandreed is a tall, coarse, stemmy, open, sod 
forming grass found on sandy soil sites in typically 
low precipitation zones. Its coarsely fibrous root 
system augmented by scaly, spreading rhizomes 
produces an effective sand binding species. Its culms 
are 3 to 5 feet tall, arising singularly and are attached 
to its stout spreading rhizomes. Leaves are pale green 
to straw colored. Leaf blades are rigid, flat to rolled, 
hairless, 12 inches long or longer and tapered to a 
drawn out tip. The ligule is short and hairy and the 
collar is hairy inside. Inflorescence is a panicle 6 to 
13 inches long, semi-open and wider in the middle. 
Spikelets are pale, shiny and one flowered. The 
lemmas are awnless and densely hairy at the base. It 
flowers from August to September and like most 
grasses is wind pollinated. 
 
Prairie sandreed is drought tolerant and adapted to an 
average annual precipitation of from 10 to 20 inches. 
It is predominantly found growing in clumps or 
colonies on coarse, sandy soil types. It will grow on 
soils that are somewhat alkaline, but it does not 
tolerate salt. It also is intolerant of high water tables 
and early spring flooding. Prairie sandreed occurs 
naturally in mixed native stands with sand bluestem 
Andropogon hallii, little bluestem Schizachyrium 
scoparium, and sand lovegrass Eragrostis trichoides 
on sandy range sites. Several shrubs, including yucca, 
Yucca glauca, and sand sage, Artimesia filifolia, and 
a variety of forbs occur intermixed on these sites. It 
has been found growing on blow out sites in the 
Nebraska Sandhills.

field space plant nursery at Manhattan, Kansas. The 
top ranked accessions from the nursery were 
provided to L.C. Newell, ARS Agronomist, for 
further evaluation for vigor, forage production and 
rust tolerance. Evaluation trials comparing Goshen

Nebraska sedge is a perennial, strongly rhizomatous 
wetland plant that is found in low valleys to mid-
elevations. It will form dense stands, and is often the 
dominant member of the wetland community. Stems 
are erect and triangular from 20 to 110 cm (8 to 43 
in) tall. Leaves are alternate, up to 12 mm (0.5 in) 
wide and can be longer or shorter than the stem. 
Foliage is green or often a glaucus blue. Spikes can 
be pistillate, staminate or androgynous (staminate 
flowers above). The fruit is a light brown achene (2 
mm long) surrounded by a perigynium. Perigynia are 
elliptic to ovate, 3 to 4 mm long and yellowish brown 
to light brown in color. 
 
Nebraska sedge is a commonly occurring wetland 
species found from Canada to Mexico and California 
to Illinois. 
 
Nebraska sedge is found in wet meadows, marshes, 
streams, ditches, seeps, ponds and lakes throughout 
the western U.S. Plants can handle standing water for 
long periods of time as long as there are periods 
when the soils are dry. 
 
Plants are best adapted to slightly acidic to somewhat 
alkaline conditions tolerating pH levels from 5.7 to 
7.4. They are also tolerant of medium levels of 
salinity (EC&lt.14).

makes this an excellent species for soil stabilization 
and bioengineering applications in wetland sites.  
 
Plants also have approximately half the protein level 
of alfalfa and are thus a valuable forage species for 
big game and livestock later in the growing season. 
Shoots are grazed by muskrat and geese, while seeds 
are eaten by small mammals and birds.

The Aberdeen PMC has released four performance 
tested ecotypes of Nebraska sedge from the PMC 
service area. Centennial Selection was collected from 
the Centennial Marsh Wildlife Management Area 
(WMA) in Camas County, ID. It was selected for use 
in Land Resource Region (LRR) B West. The Modoc 
Selection was selected for use in LRR D North. It 
was collected from the Modoc National Wildlife 
Refuge (NWR) near Alturas, CA. The Sterling 
Selection comes from the Sterling WMA, north of 
Aberdeen, ID and was selected for use in LRR B 
East. The Ruby Lake Selection was selected for use 
in LRR D South. The collection site was at the Ruby 
Lake NWR in Elko County, NV. 
 
Twenty-one Nebraska sedge collections were 
evaluated at the Aberdeen Plant Materials Center 
from 1991 to 1995. All collections were evaluated for 
survival, vigor, overall growth and spread, potential 
seed production, above ground biomass production, 
stability of land ownership, and public accessibility. 
The PMC released one selection from each LRR in 
the PMC service area. The released selections are the 
accessions with the best overall rating against others 
from within its respective LRR. 
 
Generation 0 (G0) seed is maintained at Aberdeen 
PMC. Later generation seed (ie G1) is not produced, 
maintained or available through the USDA-NRCS

alternate from each other with toothed leaf margins.  
Each small yellow flower has four petals up to 1 ½ 
inches across which includes the pistils (female 
organs) and eight prominent stamens (the male 
organs). The flowers tube is usually no more than 1 
inch long. The flowers open in early morning and

about 20 feet.  Catalpas prefer moist, deep, well 
drained soil, but adapts to dry or wet soils.  The soil 
pH may range from 5.5 to 7.0.  It prefers an open 
sunny space to partial shade.   It is tall with an 
irregular, open-rounded to narrow-oval crown.  This 
tree comes into leaf very late in the spring and it is 
one of the first to lose its leaves in the fall.  Its 
longevity is about 60 years. 
 
The tree bark ranges from scaly to ridged, to blocky 
plates.  On young tree seedlings the bark is thin and 
easily damaged by impact, or rodents. 
 
Twigs in winter have a unique identifying 
characteristic.  They have sunken leaf scars which 
resemble suction cups.  Their whorled arrangement 
of 3 scars per node is another trait easily identified. 
 
Leaves are simple, large ovate to ovate-oblong, from

New Jersey tea in full flower from the PLANTS Database. 
Alternate Names redroot, Indian tea, wild snowball, 
snowbrush, and soapbloom 
 
Uses 
Wildlife: Rabbit, elk and deer browse New Jersey tea and 
turkey and quail eat the fruit. The small flowers attract 
numerous insects, especially bees, wasps, flies, and 
beetles. Butterflies and moths visit the flowers 
occasionally. These insects collect nectar from the 
flowers, although bees may also collect pollen. The 
caterpillars of the butterfly Celestina neglecta (summer 
azure) and the skipper Erynnis martialis (Mottled 
Duskywing) feed on the flowers, flower buds, and fruit of 
a variety of small woody shrubs including New Jersey tea.   
 
Ethnobotanical: Tribes of the Missouri River region used 
the leaves for tea and the roots for fuel on hunting trips. 
Tribes of the Great Lakes Bioregion ascribed great power 
to its treatment of bowel troubles. Although New Jersey 
tea was never listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia, it was used 
by some physicians. New Jersey tea is a strong astringent 
(8 percent tannins) and contains an alkaloid that is mildly 
hypotensive. The leaves contain the flavonols afzelin, 
quercitrin, and rutin. It was used by colonists during the 
Revolutionary War as a substitute for tea even though the

Description and Adaptation  
 
 
New Jersey tea distribution from USDA-NRCS PLANTS Database. 
 
General: Buckthorn Family (Rhamnaceae).  This 
shrubby, upright, deciduous, native perennial grows to 
approximately 3 feet in height. It will tiller at the base, 
sending up multiple stems. Its stems are light green and 
covered with fine white hairs which become woody with 
age in the absence of fire or browsing by wildlife. Leaves 
are alternate and broadly oblong-ovate, up to 3 inches 
long and 2 inches wide. The underside of the leaf is light 
green and covered with fine white hairs. The leaf margins 
are smooth to finely serrate, and slightly ciliate. The 
simple leaves have short petioles and three conspicuous 
palmate veins. From the axils of the upper leaves emerge 
long stalked clusters of numerous white flowers. These 
clusters of flowers are elongated and rounded. Each 
individual flower consists of a long slender tube 
terminated in five folded sepals. When the calyx opens 
five hatchet shaped petals with slender bases spread 
outward, while a large pistil and five stamens, with dark 
gray anthers emerge from the flower’s center.  The 
flowers have a pleasant fragrance and bloom for about a 
month during early summer. Later, three small (1/4 inch)

lobed fruits (Drupe) form, splitting into three carpels each 
containing a smooth coated, elliptical, brown seed. The 
root system consists of a stout, deeply anchored reddish 
taproot. Thus, the common name for New Jersey tea is red 
root.     
For updated distribution, please consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
 
Adaptation: New Jersey tea is usually found on the sandy 
soils of open woodlands and prairies, and on rocky 
hillsides. It is fire adapted with top growth being typically 
killed by fire, but vigorous resprouting from the 
undamaged rootstock. It has the ability to slowly spread 
from seed production. however the seedling vigor is 
considered quite low.  
Drought resistance is very good, under severe drought the 
leaves will become discolored and shrivel, but quickly 
revive when moisture returns. 
 
Establishment 
It can be propagated by root division in the fall, softwood 
cuttings forced in the greenhouse in spring, or by seed. 
Seed of New Jersey tea should be planted outside in the 
fall or early winter in a well drained soil site with full sun. 
Note that the plant does not require cold moist 
stratification, but spring plantings have been enhanced by 
submerging the seed in 180 degree Fahrenheit water the 
night before planting and allowing seeds to soak in the 
slowly cooling liquid. Since there are many mammalian 
herbivores that browse this species its establishment can 
be a challenge when there are large populations of these 
active browsing species about. 
 
Management 
Fire is a beneficial management tool in promoting the 
spread of this species. It has a high tolerance for drought 
and restricted water conditions. The plant cannot survive 
exposure to temperatures below negative 28 degrees 
Fahrenheit. New Jersey tea is listed as a threatened 
species in the state of Maine. 
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Foliar disease is rarely a significant problem for this 
species. however it is susceptible to leaf spot and 
powdery mildew.  
 
Control 
Please contact your local agricultural extension specialist 
or county weed specialist to learn what works best in your 
area and how to use it safely.  Always read label and 
safety instructions for each control method.  Trade names 
and control measures appear in this document only to 
provide specific information.  USDA NRCS does not 
guarantee or warranty the products and control methods

Contributed by: USDA NRCS East Texas Plant Materials 
Center. 
Melinda Brakie-USDA NRCS Plant Materials  
 
Alternate Names 
The alternate names for eastern redbud include Judas tree 
and redbud. 
Uses 
The Henry’s elfin butterfly (Callophyrus henrici) and 
hummingbirds utilize eastern redbud for nectar. 
Honeybees use the flowers for pollen. 
Native Americans boiled the bark to make tea to treat 
whooping cough. Dysentery was treated using an 
astringent from the bark. The roots and inner bark were 
utilized for fevers, congestion, and vomiting. The flowers 
can be fried and eaten. 
Whitetail deer browse the foliage and twigs during the 
spring and summer. Squirrels occasionally eat the buds, 
bark, and seed. Bobwhite quail and songbirds eat the 
seeds. However, for the animals which utilize eastern 
redbud, it is considered a less desirable or emergency 
food. Livestock will infrequently graze on the foliage and 
twigs. 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
Description and Adaptation 
Eastern redbud is a native, perennial, deciduous tree 
which grows 15 to 30 feet tall and spreads 15 to 25 feet. 
Older trees generally resemble a vase shape. This tree is a 
member of Fabaceae or pea family. Eastern redbud is 
found throughout the lower Great Plains and eastern 
United States. For updated distribution, please consult the 
Plant Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
site. 
 
Eastern redbud distribution from USDA-NRCS PLANTS Database. 
 
Eastern redbud is usually one of the first trees to bloom in 
spring. Pink to reddish purple flowers are grown on old 
twigs, branches, and trunks. Flowering occurs in March to 
May before leaf growth. After bloom, the leaves begin 
growing and gradually turn dark green. When mature, the 
alternately arranged leaves are about four inches long, 
four inches wide and heart shaped with prominent 
venation. The twigs are slender, spreading, zigzag with 
short or dark brown knotty spurs. Eastern redbud 
produces clusters of flat green pods (~3.5 inches long, 
~0.5 inches wide) that change to brown when mature. 
Each pod contains four to ten small hard black or brown 
seeds. 
Eastern redbud occurs as scattered trees or small 
populations. It is an understory species in open woods and 
is found on moist, loam or sandy soils in valleys or 
bottomlands. Usually this tree is more numerous on south 
facing slopes with more sunlight. Eastern redbud grows 
on a wide range of pH. however, it grows best on soils 
with a pH of 7.5 or above. It is not found on inundated 
sites, poorly aerated soils, or coarse sands. The tree is fire 
tolerant and root sprouts after fire.

materials.nrcs.usda.gov&gt. 
F. The seeds can then be planted 
Establishment 
In fall, collect the mature pods before they open and 
release their seed or insects, particularly weevils, attack 
the seeds. Collect a large number to compensate for a 
high percentage of inferior seeds. Store air dried seeds in 
sealed glass jars or metal containers at 350 to 410F. 
Eastern redbud has a hard seed coat and dormancy. 
Scarify the seed coat by mechanical scarification, 
immersing in boiling water, or in concentrated sulfuric 
acid for approximately 30 minutes. After scarifying, 
stratify in moist sand for five to eight weeks at 
approximately 410
outdoors in the fall or stored for spring planting. In late 
April or early May, plant the treated seeds in a well 
prepared seedbed at a maximum depth of 0.2 inches. Very 
young seedlings which have sprouted around parent trees 
are easily moved when they are small. 
Management 
Eastern  redbud  develops  a  deep  taproot  that  grows 
quickly  the  first  few  years  under  conducive  conditions. 
Pruning the tree helps develop a strong structure. 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Three main disease effect eastern redbud: leaf 
anthracnose, (Mycosphaerella cercidicola), 
Botryosphaeria canker, and verticillium wilt. 
Botryosphaeria canker produces stem and twig lesions 
and entire stands have been killed by the disease. Several 
species of wood borers attack the tree. The redbud 
leaffolder, grape leaffolder, and Japanese weevil feed on 
the leaves. 
Environmental Concerns 
The seed are dispersed by wind and animals. 
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
Commercially available cultivars of eastern redbud 
include. ‘Pink Charm’ and  ‘Pinkbud’- pink flowers. 
‘Purple Leaf’- foliage is purple when young. ‘Silver 
Cloud’- leaves variegated with white, ‘Flame’- double 
flowers and no seed pods,  and ‘Forest Pansy’.

Alternate Names 
Texas sugarberry, sugar hackberry, hackberry, palo 
blanco, southern hackberry, and lowland hackberry 
 
Uses 
Conservation: Sugarberry is used in native landscaping 
and habitat restorations, and windbreaks. 
 
Ethnobotanic:  Sugarberry was used by a variety of 
Native American tribes.  The Houma used a concentrate 
made from the bark to treat sore throats and a decoction 
made from the bark and ground up shells to treat venereal 
disease.  The Comanche would beat the fruits of 
sugarberry to a pulp.  The pulp was then mixed with 
animal fat, rolled into balls, and roasted in the fire for 
food.  The Acoma, Navajo, and Tewa all consumed the 
berries for food.  The Navajo boiled the leaves and 
branches to make dark brown and red dye for wool. 
 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
Wildlife: Many species of songbirds including 
mockingbirds and robins eat the fruit and use the tree for 
nesting habitat.  It is a larval and nectar host for two 
butterflies: hackberry emperor (Asterocampa celtis) and 
American snout (Libytheana carineta).  White-tailed deer 
browse the leaves and fruit. 
 
Other Uses: Sugarberry is used for furniture, athletic 
goods, firewood, and plywood. It has limited use for 
flooring, creating, and for wood posts.  It is used as an 
ornamental and as a street tree in residential areas in the 
lower South 
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g. threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
 
Description and Adaptation 
Sugarberry is a native tree that can grow up to 80 feet in 
height and up to 3 feet in diameter.  It is a short lived tree, 
probably living not more than 150 years.  It has a broad 
crown formed by spreading branches that are often 
drooped.  The bark is light gray in color and can be 
smooth or covered with corky warts.  The branchlets are 
covered with short hairs at first and eventually they 
become smooth.  The leaves are alternated, simple, and 
slightly serrate.  The leaves are 2-4 inches long and 1 to 2 
inches wide.  The lance-shaped leaves gradually taper to a 
point that is often curved.  They are pale green on both 
the upper and lower surfaces with conspicuous veins.  The 
flowers appear just before or with the leaves in the spring.  
The drupes or fruit have a thick skin and the surface has a 
netlike pattern.  They will range in color from orange to 
reddish-brown.   
 
 Sugarberry is found growing in sandy loam or rocky soils 
along streams, in bottomlands, and in woodlands.    
 
Distribution: Sugarberry ranges south from southeastern 
Virginia to southern Florida, west to central Texas and 
northeastern Mexico, and north to western Oklahoma, 
southern Kansas, Missouri, southern Illinois, southern 
Indiana, and western Kentucky.  It is localized in 
Maryland, the Rio Grande Valley, and northeastern 
Mexico.  Its range overlaps the southern part of the range 
of common hackberry (C. occidentalis). Please consult 
the Plant Profile page for this species on the PLANTS 
Web site.

Establishment 
Sugarberry can be propagated by seed and cuttings.  The 
mature fruits can be picked from late summer until winter.  
Air-dry the fruits with pulp on or soak overnight and rub 
pulp off on a screen.  To stratify, store wet seeds in sealed 
containers in a refrigerator for 60-90 days at 41 degrees.  
Stratified seed can be sown in the spring or you may sow 
non-stratified seed in the fall. Sugarberry can be rooted 
from juvenile wood and from root sprouts or suckers.  
 
Management 
Sugarberry that is top-killed by fire or cut at the base of 
the trunk will re-sprout from the root collar. 
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
When grown in its native habitat and from local seed 
stock, sugarberry is not prone to debilitating pests. It is 
frequently parasitized by mistletoe.  It appears to be no 
more sensitive to trunk rot than laurel oak (Q. laurifolia

have planted redbud in informal and formal gardens

from 7 to 20 feet tall with a dense rounded crown that 
almost reaches the ground.  California redbud, also 
known as western redbud, is currently recognized as 
Cercis orbiculata Greene.  The leaves are simple, 
thick, and rounded or heart-shaped, and have from 7 
to 9 prominent veins.  They are deciduous. their 
autumn display of yellow turning to red and brown 
rivals that of some eastern hardwoods.  The striking 
sweetpea-like flowers appear before the leaves, in 
small clusters along the branches.  Each flower has 5 
petals that range in color from magenta pink to 
reddish purple.  Pollination is by bumble bees 
(Bombus sp.) and orchard mason bees (Osmia 
lignaria).  Although the pink sprays can be seen from 
February through April, any one shrub will remain in 
flower only about 2 weeks.  In autumn the branches 
often bear many clusters of pointed, flat, very thin 
pods, the upper suture with a conspicuous winged 
margin.  In ripening, the pods are first purple and 
then russet-brown, each containing an average of 7 
hard, bean-like seeds.  The mature pods persist into 
the next winter.

at elevations of 4,000 feet or less, in canyons and on 
rather steep slopes, in gravelly and rocky soils along 
streams where it is never flooded.  It also grows in 
the bottom of ephemeral streambeds in little pockets, 
benches, or crannies of boulder outcroppings.  The 
plant is drought tolerant, sun-loving, and grows in a 
wide variety of soils, but it is usually found in rather 
harsh environments with coarse, nutrient-poor soils 
that are well-drained.  It grows mostly singly, but 
sometimes, in sheltered situations, in shrubby 
clumps.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD fs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_Establishment='If possible, gather the seed from local sources, to 
maintain genetic diversity of redbud.  The seedpods 
can be collected from September to November from 
redbud branches.  Redbud seeds are adapted to 
prolonged periods of dryness and cold and they 
require special pretreatment to germinate, owing to 
an impervious seed coat plus a dormant embryo.  One 
method is to place the seeds into a container and pour 
boiling water over them and let the seeds soak 
overnight.  They can then be covered with damp peat 
moss and refrigerated for two months or they can be 
planted right away.  The germination of redbud seed 
in the wild is favored by fire, which cracks the seed 
coat and generates the heat needed to stimulate 
germination. 
     Plant the treated seed in the fall in flats, spacing 
the seeds approximately 1 to 2 inches apart.  Use a 
slow-release fertilizer in the planting mix.  Cover 
with about 1/4 inch of soil (approximately 3 to 4 
times the width of the seed).  To reduce the 
possibility of damping off, keep the flats outdoors in 
a protected area with partial shade and little wind.  
Water the flats through the winter and then let the 
plants grow 1 full year before planting them out.  The 
seedlings will be about 3 inches to 1 foot tall by the 
following fall.   Plant the seedlings in a sunny 
location with good drainage.  If gophers are a 
problem, plant redbud seedlings in cages.  Watering 
is not necessary until the following summer, in a 
normal rainfall year.  Give the young plants summer 
water for the first 3 years in the ground.  This 
amounts to once every 2 weeks in a hot climate and 
less in a coastal climate. Do not overwater, as redbud 
will not tolerate summer water in the root crown area 
(at the soil level) and will suffer crown rot 
(Phytophthora sp.) if watered too frequently.  When 
redbud leaves first emerge in the spring, use a liquid 
fertilizer to boost its growth.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
' WHERE symbol='ceor9';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD fs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_Management=' 
Pruning: Periodic pruning of redbud, after it has  
reached the minimum age of 5 years, can be 
accomplished to remove dead or dying branches that 
might harbor diseases or insects.  Pruning should take 
place in the fall, winter, or early spring, after leaf 
drop and during the dormant period.  Contemporary 
Native American weavers practice two types of 
pruning.  One technique is coppicing, where the 
whole plant is cut to within several inches of the 
ground.  Redbud vigorously resprouts from the 
coppice stool, sending up young straight shoots with 
a beautiful red pigment.  This can bring added color 
to gardens and also these shoots are highly valued for 
basket weaving.  Coppicing, however, should only be 
done on mature shrubs--at least a decade old.  
Flowering will be lost, until the young sprouts are 
two to three years old and shed the red pigment and 
form true bark.  The other technique is selective 
pruning within the canopy to direct the growth of the 
plant.  This pruning leaves some older flowering 
branches, important for bees and butterflies.   
Burning: Before Euro-American settlement of 
California, Native Americans conducted purposeful 
burning of hillsides in the fall of the year, after 
redbud has shed its leaves, to encourage the growth 
of young, straight shoots used extensively in 
basketry.  Redbud also resprouts vigorously after 
fires.

Didymella leguminis-cytisis.  Most of these diseases

Alternate Names  
Aheahea,  ahea,  ahewahewa,  alaweo,  alaweo  huna 
(Niihau), kahaihai, goosefoot, pigweed, lamb’s quarters  
  
Uses  
Conservation:   
The  potential  uses  for  aweoweo  include  ecosystem 
restoration,  erosion  control,  and  enhancing  diversity  in 
riparian and other communities.  
  
Wildlife Habitat:   
On Moku Manu, Oahu, sooty terns and red-foot boobies 
use  ‘aweoweo  as  cover  and  also  its  dead  branches  for 
nests.    
  
Hawaiian Cultural:   
During ancient Hawaiian times, Aweoweo wood was used 
to make shark hooks and its leaves were cooked and eaten 
like spinach.  
  
Status  
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g. threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values).  
  
 
Plant Fact Sheet
the 
Description and Adaptation  
A weakly scented shrub, the aweoweo can reach 5-20m in 
height.    Its  leaves  are  3-lobed  and  somewhat  fleshy.  
Leaves  are  also  pubescent  with  the  bottom  half  more 
pubescent and a lighter green as well.  Flowers are small 
on leafless panicles producing seeds that are dark-brown 
and about 0.8mm in diameter.  
  
Aweoweo is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands.  It can be 
found on the northwestern Hawaiian islands of Lisianski, 
Laysan, French Frigate Shoals, Necker, and Nihoa.  It is 
also  found  throughout  the  main  Hawaiian  Islands,  but 
according  to  the  Manual  of  the  Flowering  Plants  of 
Hawaii  (1999)
,  aweoweo  has  not  been  observed  to  be 
occurring  naturally  on 
island  of  Kahoolawe.  
Aweoweo  is  adapted  to  dry  habitats  of  coastal  and  dry 
forests and can also be found in subalpine shrublands as 
well, ranging in elevation from 0 – 2,520 meters.  
  
Distribution: Please consult the Plant Profile page for this 
species on the PLANTS Web site.  
  
Establishment  
Aweoweo can be propagated either by seed or by 
vegetative cuttings.  Dibble tubes with sterile planting 
medium are recommended for starting cuttings.  Seedlings 
should be started in 200-cell flats and then transplanted to 
dibble tubes.  Seeds germinate within 5-10 days. 
Propagules should be ready to plant in the field by 5-6 
months after starting in a shade-house.  It is recommended 
that they be placed in direct sunlight about a month before 
planting.  Irrigation is recommended for the first 6 months 
after planting in the field at which time the plants should 
be able to survive simply on natural rainfall.  
  
Management  
Aweoweo  is  a  hardy  plant  that  requires  very  little 
management.  It is well adapted to low rainfall situations 
having a very high drought tolerance.  It can also tolerate 
nutrient depleted soils as well.   Aweoweo does very well 
under cultivation as well.  With the addition of moisture 
and  fertilizer  supplements,  shrubs  are  able  to  grow  with 
relatively high vigor.    
  
Pests and Potential Problems  
There  are  no  known  pests  that  are  detrimental  to  the 
aweoweo life cycle.    
  
Studies show that cultivated aweoweo produces seed with 
very low germination rates.  This is overcome by the fact 
that it produces a large amount of seed.  It is speculated 
that because aweoweo produces seed throughout the year, 
the majority of the seed harvested might be immature.

UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_Description='Atlantic white cedar is one of only six species in this 
genus.  Only three of the six are native to the 
continent, and two of them are west coast species.  
This leaves Atlantic white cedar as the only 
representative in the East, where it occurs in a narrow 
band along the Atlantic coast.  Atlantic white cedar is 
an evergreen with scaly leaves that occur in a flat 
fern-like appearance.  This species usually grows in 
very dense, solid stands, and has small rounded 
cones.   
However, Atlantic white cedar can be confused with 
arborvitae (also called northern white cedar -Thuja 
occidentalis) which also occurs in the region where 
the ranges overlap in New York and New England.  
In Atlantic white cedar, the evergreen leaves are 
paired and have short points on the tip.  Arborvitae 
has leaves that are more rounded-appearing to the 
naked eye but also have short points when viewed 
closely or with a lens.  Arborvitae has cones of 
similar size but are more elongated than those of 
Atlantic white cedar.

or longer.  The habitat of this species is very limited, 
and increasingly rare due to coastal development.  
Associated trees include red maple, black gum, white 
pine, hemlock, gray birch, and pitch pine.  Associated 
shrubs include lowbush and highbush blueberry.  The 
great range in latitude that white cedar occupies 
(from Maine to Florida) helps account for the broad 
species association. 
Arborvitae has a much broader longitudinal and 
elevational range, and is adapted to soils that are 
slightly acid to alkaline.  Arborvitae grows on upland 
and lowland sites, and in areas with growing seasons 
as short as 30 days up to 200 days. 
Both species can be grown on wet, lowland sites with 
moderate acidity.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD fs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_Establishment='Due to the dense stands which white cedar often 
creates, it should not be surprising that 8-9 million 
seeds per acre may be disbursed in a decent seed 
crop.  These seeds are winged and very light, and 
may be carried long distances by strong winds.  Seed 
dormancy is common and seed can remain viable in 
the forest litter for many years.  Light and moisture 
are required for germination to occur, and continuous 
moisture appears to be mandatory.  Seedlings grow to 
saplings at the rate of about 12 inches per year on 
favorable sites with open but moist conditions.  
Seedlings are very vulnerable to crowding from other 
species. 
White cedar seedlings are not commonly grown in 
the nursery, so little is documented about the size and 
age of transplants.  It is likely that the 1-0 class 
would be preferred as bare-root stock.  White cedar 
has a shallow root system, so suitable planting sites 
must have abundant moisture very close to the 
surface.

Site selection is critical to the success of white cedar.  
Moisture must be reliable, and competition from 
other species must be controlled.  The site must also 
have protection from high winds or else severe wind-
throw will result.  Fire will readily kill white cedar if 
it gets into the crowns.  Finally, heavy ice and snow 
will often break or topple young trees.  Deer will 
preferentially browse white cedar. Beaver presence 
favors white cedar as deciduous species are 
preferentially cut by them, leaving the cedar saplings 
or poles.

Alternate Names 
Carduus discolor (Muhl. ex Willd.) Nutt 
Uses 
Wildlife: The large flowers and abundant nectar are very 
attractive to many species of butterflies, hummingbirds, 
bees and moths.  Many other species will also use other 
plant parts for food, including the leaves, stems, roots, 
flower heads and seeds.  Seeds are attractive to seed 
eating birds such as such as the American goldfinch.      
 
Ethnobotanical:  Field thistle, like other Cirsium species, 
has edible roots, inner stems, young leaves, young inner 
parts of flower buds and seeds.  Native Americans used a 
paste of the roots for treating wounds, boils, and piles, 
and also used an infusion of the root for treating stomach 
ache.  Native Americans also used the thistle down (or 
pappus) from the seeds to fletch the tail end of blow darts.       
Status

noxious weed, including all native as well as non-native 
species in the genus.  Please consult the PLANTS Web

this plant’s current status (e.g., threatened or endangered 
species, state noxious status, and wetland indicator 
values). 
Weediness 
Seeds are naturally wind dispersed although most seeds 
fall fairly close to the original plant.  Field thistle can 
sometimes be found in pastures (usually overgrazed), but 
unlike non-native thistles it is not invasive and weedy in 
properly managed agricultural fields.  Please consult with 
your local NRCS Field Office, Cooperative Extension 
Service office, state natural resource, or state agriculture 
department regarding its status and use.  Weed 
information is also available from the PLANTS Web site 
at http://plants.usda.gov.  Please consult the Related Web 
Sites on the Plant Profile for this species for further 
information. 
Description and Adaptation 
Field thistle is a native biennial or short lived perennial 
(monocarpic) thistle growing in much of the eastern 
half of the U.S. and Canada.  It can be found growing 
in meadows, wood edges and openings, field borders, 
abandoned fields, pastures and roadsides.  Field thistle 
initially grows in a basal rosette form (circle of leaves 
originating from one growing point at the soil surface).   
 
Plants only form flowering stems after growing through 
at least one winter and sometimes two or three.  Stems 
grow 2–8 inches tall and are branched on the upper 
third.  Stems have white hairs, and lack the spiny wings 
found on many non-native thistles.  Leaves alternate on 
the stem and have deep spine-tipped lobes.  Leaves 
have a distinctive white mat of fine hairs on the 
undersides and sparse, week hairs on the upper surface.   
 
The lavender pink to light pink, or rarely white flower 
heads are about 2 inches across and consist of many 
narrow tube-shaped flowers about 1½ inches long.  
Flowers billow out from a narrow base, forming a 
distinctive mushroom shape.  The flower base has 
overlapping green bracts with white center-lines and 
sharply angled, thin needle like spines.  Field thistle 
can be found blooming from late summer to fall, with 
individual plants bloom for about a month.  Seeds have 
long downy plumes that aid dispersal by the wind.  
Plants typically have a large central taproot with some 
coarse rope-like secondary roots.

natural systems or low intensity unmanaged pastures, but 
may not be desirable in highly managed pastures. 
Control 
Field thistle does not spread by underground stems 
(rhizomes) or roots and is not invasive or as difficult to 
control as non-native thistles.  Unlike the non-native 
thistles, many of the native thistles have become 
uncommon in the landscape.  Get to know your local 
thistle species so that you can distinguish the non-native 
weeds to be removed, from the native species that are 
important for the pollinators!  Please contact your local 
agricultural extension specialist or county weed specialist 
to learn what control methods work best in your area and 
how to use it safely.  Always read label and safety 
instructions for each control method.

Establishment 
Field thistle grows well with full sun to partial shade and 
average to dry soil moisture.  It is best to plant field thistle 
in an area where competing vegetation has been removed.  
In late fall to early spring, seeds can be sown directly on 
bare soil and lightly covered with no more than one 
quarter inch of soil raked or spread over the seed.  Seeds 
may also be sown in containers and transplanted when 
plants are large enough to be handled.  Plants have a deep 
root system and should not require supplemental water 
once established.  Plants of good size going into winter 
will generally bloom the following late summer.  
Management 
Field thistle will die after flowering and maturing seed, 
but will readily self seed on open soil or with sparse 
vegetation.  Reducing competition from very competitive 
plants such as tall fescue will yield larger plants.      
Pests and Potential Problems 
Several introduced species of weevil can cause significant 
damage to field thistle.  The larvae of the Canada thistle 
bud weevil (Larinus planus) feeds on developing seeds 
and flower parts, reducing the number and quality of 
seeds produced.  The larvae of the thistle crown weevil 
(Trichosirocalus horriduscan) feed on the inner parts of 
the crown where the leaves and stem meet the roots.  The 
resulting damage often leads to a secondary fungal 
infection that kills the entire plant.   
Environmental Concerns 
Grazing animals will avoid grazing the immediate area 
around thistles.  Since thistle will tend to grow in the 
over-grazed areas, this naturally allows areas to recover 
from over-gazing and therefore may be desirable in

Farewell to spring, a member of the evening primrose 
family (Onagraceae), is a common, native, annual 
wildflower that grows ½ to 3 feet tall.  Stems are upright 
to spreading, leafy, covered in fine, short hairs, somewhat 
grayish-green, often reddish below, and may be branched 
or simple.  The alternate leaves are linear to lance-shaped, 
usually 1 to 3 inches long, smooth-edged, with lower 
leaves often falling by flowering time, while the upper 
leaves are more persistent and often folded.  The flowers 
are single or in open to dense inflorescences with buds 
held erect.  Flowers are cup-shaped, pale pink to deep 
wine red, and have four petals that are usually less than 
1½ inches long, with more or less notched edges, often 
with a crimson to scarlet or purplish marking in their 
center.  Flowers have eight stamens and a single pistil 
with a 4-lobed stigma.  Flowering period is late spring to 
mid-summer.  Fruits are long, narrow, straight to curved, 
pod-like dry capsules ¼ to 1½ inches long that ripen in 
the fall.  There are five generally recognized subspecies of 
C. amoena, although intermediates among subspecies are 
common: Hunt’s clarkia (C. a. ssp. huntiana), Lindley’s 
clarkia (C. a. ssp. lindleyi), northwestern farewell to 
spring (C. a. ssp. caurina), Whitney’s clarkia (C. a. ssp. 
whitneyi), and farewell to spring (C. a. ssp. amoena).

Farewell to spring prefers relatively dry, open slopes but 
is also found in meadows, prairies, seaside bluffs, coastal 
scrub, forest edges, roadsides and spring-wet areas.  
Plants grow best in full sun to light shade and well-
drained to dry soil, but also tolerate seaside conditions, 
alkaline soil, salt, sand and clay.  This species’ native

FREMONT’S LEATHER 
FLOWER 
Clematis fremontii S. Wats.  
Plant Symbol = CLFR 
Contributed by: USDA NRCS Plant Materials Center, 
Manhattan, Kansas 
 
Mike Haddock, Kansas State University  
 
Fremont’s leather flower was named for Gen. John C. 
Frémont, U.S. Army Corps of Topographical Engineers, 
and famous explorer of the American West, who first 
cataloged this plant in the 1840s.   
 
Alternate Names  
Fremont’s clematis, Fremont’s crowsfoot, Fremont’s 
leather-plant, leatherplant, rattleweed   
 
Uses  
Ornamental:  Fremont’s leather flower has potential as a 
garden plant with its unique, showy, bell or urn-shaped 
flowers, ornamental fruit clusters, interesting texture and 
long period of attractiveness.  It may be planted in large 
groups and is an attractive addition to rock gardens, 
border fronts, native plant gardens, prairies or meadows.  
Fremont’s leather flower combines well with other native 
herbaceous spring bloomers, such as pasque flower and 
prairie smoke.  The dried plants, with fruit clusters and 
foliage intact have potential for dried arrangements.     
 
Status  
CAUTION!! Described as one of our rarest plants, 
Fremont’s leather flower is protected in Missouri.  Please

noxious status, and wetland indicator values).  
 
Description and Adaptation   
An herbaceous perennial, non-climbing, shrubby-type 
clematis, with broad ovate leathery green leaves to 5 
inches long with parallel veins, appearing alternate, 
simple, and sessile, on erect stems 12 to 18 inches tall, 
arising from a stout caudex bearing many fibrous roots. 
Thick, non-spreading, often recurved sepals form an inch-
long solitary bell-shaped purple to white flower nodding 
on a slender stalk atop the foliage.  Blooming occurs late 
April into June, giving rise to large clusters of achenes 
each tipped with a long, curled style.  The achenes and 
foliage turn brown in the fall and persist into the winter. 
 
 Large cluster of achenes

Fremont’s leather flower thrives in full sun on a lean 
alkaline soil.  Although this species naturally occurs on 
rocky prairie sites such as Fort Hays Limestone and 
Smoky Hill Chalk, and on limestone glades in the eastern 
Ozark region, it has been found to be a hardy, very easy to 
grow, long lived garden plant given full sun to part shade 
and rich, well drained soil.  This species is adapted to the 
20 to 24 inch precipitation zone.  Distribution:  Fremont’s 
leather flower is limited in distribution to north central 
Kansas, south central Nebraska and the eastern Ozark 
region of Missouri.  A recent discovery from Tennessee 
near Chattanooga in 2006 and a nearby Georgia 
population has been reported.  For current distribution, 
please consult the Plant Profile page for this species on 
the PLANTS Web site.   
 
Habitat: Fremont’s leather flower is native to limestone 
prairies and dolomite glades.

dogwood has a brown pith in 1-2 year old stems, dark 
green ovate leaves, yellowish-white flowers which 
bloom in mid-June, and bluish colored fruit which 
matures in September.  Redosier dogwood has a

practice.  On sites with banks that may become dry 
over the summer, utilize silky dogwood next to the 
water, with  
willows above.  Immediately after planting, grasses 
and legumes may be planted to provide initial 
stabilization.  After 2 or 3 years the dogwoods will 
become effective. Silky dogwood is vulnerable to 
livestock browsing.  In order to ensure survival, 
fencing must be incorporated into the plan.  Rooted 
hardwood cuttings are taken in January, allowed to 
develop callus in refrigerated storage, and planted in 
mid-May in well drained soil 2 inches apart.  The 
cuttings should be 1/4-1/2 inch in diameter and 9 to

CALIFORNIA HAZELNUT 
Corylus cornuta Marsh. var. 
californica (A. DC.) Sharp 
Plant Symbol = COCOC 
Contributed by: USDA NRCS Corvallis Plant Materials 
Center 
 
© 2008 Neal Kramer 
Alternative Names 
Alternative common names:  California hazel, California 
filbert, beaked hazelnut, western beaked hazel  
Alternative scientific names:  Corylus californica (A. DC.) 
Rose, Corylus cornuta ssp. californica (A. DC.) E. Murray 
Uses 
Wildlife: California hazelnut is used in hedgerow, riparian and 
wildlife habitat plantings to provide cover and food.  The nuts 
are eaten by many animals including squirrels, chipmunks, 
jays, grouse and pheasant.  Plants may be browsed by mule 
deer and domestic livestock.  
Landscaping: California hazelnut can be incorporated into 
garden plantings or woodland parks.  It is the first native shrub 
to come into bloom in the spring, with attractive yellow 
catkins hanging from the bare branches, and its leaves turn 
bright yellow in the fall.  The Oregon Department of 
Agriculture currently has restrictions on the import and sale of 
all Corylus species within the state in order to control the 
spread of Eastern filbert blight (EFB).  California hazelnut is 
resistant to EFB, but check to see if a ban is in effect in your 
area prior to planting. 
Ethnobotanic: Many Native American tribes of the Pacific 
Northwest and California used the nuts as a food source, 
picking them in late summer to early autumn, storing until 
fully ripe, and then roasting or eating them raw.  The nuts 
were also pounded into cakes containing berries, meat, or 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
animal fat, or boiled to extract the oil, which was used as 
flavoring.  The nuts’ milk was used to cure coughs and colds, 
to heal cuts, and as an astringent.  Roots were used to make a 
bluish dye.  The wood was fashioned into arrows, fishing 
traps, hooks, and spoons, and the long, flexible shoots were 
twisted into rope or used for basketry.  Plants were burned to 
the ground periodically (about every five years) to maintain 
productivity.  The nuts were also used as a trade item among 
tribes because of their sporadic distribution.   
Status 
California hazelnut is listed as a facultative upland species in 
Oregon and Washington, meaning it usually occurs in non-
wetlands, but is occasionally found in wetlands.  Please 
consult the PLANTS Web site and your State Department of 
Natural Resources for this plant’s current status (e.g., 
threatened or endangered species, state noxious status, and 
wetland indicator values). 
Description and Adaptation 
Birch family (Betulaceae): Native, deciduous shrubs or small 
trees growing 3 to 50 feet tall and forming thickets. main 
stems straight, with spreading, ascending branches, and light 
brown twigs that are often glandular-hairy when young.  
Leaves are simple, alternate, often velvety-hairy, paler below 
than above, nearly round to ovate, 1.6-4 inches long, with  
 
doubly toothed margins.  
Male and female flowers 
are separate, but both 
types are present on 
each plant.  Male 
flowers are numerous in 
long, hanging stalks 
(catkins) 2-3 inches 
long, in clusters of 2 or 
3 near branch tips, 
appearing in the fall but 
opening early the 
following spring (Jan.-
Mar.) before leaves 
develop.  Female 
flowers are several in a 
scaly bud, tiny and 
inconspicuous, with 
only bright red stigma 
and styles protruding 
from the otherwise gray-

brown buds near the end 
of the twigs.  Fruit is a hard-shelled, acorn-like nut ½ - ¾ inch 
in diameter, completely concealed by two leafy, coarsely 
toothed, husk-like bracts fused at the tip and forming an 
extended tubular beak.  California hazelnut typically has 
glandular hairs on twigs and petioles and has a shorter husk

beak (beak length usually less than twice nut length), whereas 
the eastern beaked hazelnut (C. cornuta var. cornuta) lacks 
glandular hairs on twigs and petioles and has a longer beak 
(two times or more nut length). , .   The European hazelnut (C. 
avellana) can generally be distinguished from beaked 
hazelnuts by the exposed nuts in the involucral bracts (husks), 
although newer varieties of hazelnuts are being interbred with 
the native hazelnuts and will show intermediate traits. 
California hazelnut does well in full sun to full shade, and 
prefers moist but well-drained, loamy, acid soils with plenty of 
organic matter. it tolerates clay but not saturated soils.  Plants 
are winter hardy to 0°F, and sprout readily from the root 
crown after top-kill by fire or other disturbance.  It typically 
occupies damp rocky slopes and stream banks in the 
understory of coniferous or mixed hardwood forests at 
elevations up to 8000 feet in zones with mean annual 
precipitation of 14 to 100 inches.  Distribution ranges from 
western British Columbia, Washington and Oregon to 
California (see map below).  For updated distribution, please 
consult the Plant Profile page for this species on the PLANTS 
Web site.

Association. 
Establishment 
Propagation is easiest from seed, but seeds must be harvested 
early, just before they ripen and while husks are still a bit 
green (Jul. to Oct. depending on location), or squirrels will 
harvest the entire crop.  Allow the nuts to ripen and dry before 
sowing. husks will turn brown and can be left on or removed 
before planting.  Sow nuts about 1 inch deep outdoors in the 
fall, or cold stratify for 2-3 months to break seed dormancy 
prior to spring sowing.  There are approximately 410 seeds per 
pound, and seed viability is about one year.  Plants can also be 
vegetatively propagated by transplanting suckers from existing 
plants in late winter or early spring, or layering in the fall by 
nicking a branch, then bending and burying the nick until roots 
form.  In an irrigated sandy loam nursery bed rooting trial, 
hardwood cutting rooting success was about 60% regardless of 
treatment with Wood’s rooting compound (WRC).  In a 
related trial, hardwood cuttings showed poorer performance, 
with only 27% rooting on a greenhouse mist bench (perlite), 
9% rooting on a moderately well-drained silt loam farm field, 
and no rooting in an artificial pond, again with no significant 
effect of WRC.  Results may vary by climate.  
Management 
California hazelnut may need to be watered during the first 
year or two, but requires little management once established.  
Optional pruning to remove suckers and enhance the shape for 
landscape plantings should be done in the winter when plants 
are dormant. 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Eastern filbert blight, caused by the fungus Anisogramma 
anomala, is a growing problem for commercial filbert 
orchards in the Pacific Northwest because of susceptible 
cultivars of the European species C. avellana (common filbert) 
and C. maxima (giant filbert).  Although the native California 
hazelnut is resistant to EFB, at this time the import and sale of 
all Corylus species is under a Control Area Order in Oregon as 
a precaution to prevent spreading the disease. 
Environmental Concerns 
California hazelnut is sometimes treated with herbicides in 
commercially managed forests to reduce interference with 
establishment and growth of conifer seedlings. 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area of 
origin) 
There are no improved cultivars of California hazelnut, but 
seed and container plants are sometimes available from 
commercial sources in Washington and California.

ERECT DAYFLOWER 
Commelina erecta var. 
angustifolia (Michx.) Fern. 
plant symbol = COERA 
 
Contributed by: USDA NRCS Kika de la Garza 
Plant Materials Center 
 
Alternate Names 
whitemouth dayflower, 
widow’s tears, narrowleaf 
dayflower, and hierba del 
pollo 
 
 
 
 
 
Uses 
Wildlife:  Erect dayflower (Commelina erecta var. 
angustifolia) is said to be a preferred food source for 
white-tailed deer, so it is a good plant to consider when 
establishing deer food plots. In addition, bobwhite quail, 
white-winged doves and mourning doves eat its seeds.  
 
Restoration:  Erect dayflower can also be a good plant for 
native area restoration projects. 
 
Forage:  Cattle are known to graze erect dayflower. 
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g. threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
 
Description 
Erect dayflower is a perennial, warm-season, herbaceous 
forb.  A member of the spiderwort (Commelinaceae) 
family, erect dayflower has also  
 
 
 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
been known by the common names of widow’s tears, 
narrowleaf dayflower, and hierba del pollo.  According to 
Ajilvsgi (1991), erect dayflower is said to be named for 
the three Commelin brothers who were all Dutch 
botanists, although only two were productive in their 
field.  Erect dayflower’s two larger petals are said to 
represent the two Commelins who were published, while 
the third inconspicuous petal represents the unpublished 
brother.  
 
Erect dayflower has a showy blue flower that is attractive, 
but ephemeral (lasting only a day) and blooms from 
March to December in Texas.  Erect dayflower starts out 
erect, becoming decumbent as it matures.  There are 
currently three varieties that are found in Texas: erecta, 
deamiana, and angustifolia.    The variety angustifolia is 
native to South Texas.  Erect dayflower is often 
considered a weed, especially in rice fields.  
 
Adaptation 
Erect dayflower can be found from Wisconsin south to 
Arizona and Florida, west to Wyoming, and throughout 
most of the eastern United States. It is common in the 
eastern two-thirds of Texas, but can be found throughout 
the state. Erect dayflower can grow in both sandy and 
clayey soils in almost all habitats.  It is found along 
streambanks, in gardens, on prairies, along roadsides, and 
in waste places.   
 
Known Distribution 
  
 
Establishment 
Erect dayflower can be grown from cuttings or seed.  An 
informal germination test conducted in the greenhouse at 
the PMC yielded a germination average of 87% with 
approximately twelve hours of daylight at 75-85ºF and 
twelve hours of darkness at 50-60ºF.  Cuttings of 
dayflower had about an 80% survival rate with one node 
and three node stem cuttings.   It is recommended that a 




Page 2
rooting hormone be used to encourage rapid rooting.  
Cuttings and seedlings can be transplanted in 6-8 weeks.  
Irrigation is recommended, although not critical, at drier 
sites to help the young plants get established.  It is 
recommended that young plants be at least 6 inches in 
height before transplanting. 
 
The use of plastic plant shelters is beneficial to protect 
young plants from heavy grazing, reduce plant 
competition, and create a more beneficial microclimate 
until young plants can get established. 
 
Management 
Weed control is a problem in a dayflower plot as the 
leggy plants make it difficult to remove the weeds without 
removing the plants.  A weed mat is recommended for 
situations, such as seed or plant production plantings, 
where weed control is a necessity.  In other situations, 
such as deer food plots, weed control may not be an issue.  
Irrigation is recommended during drier periods for seed 
and plant production plantings.   
 
The seed of erect dayflower is easy to process once 
harvested.  However, the prostrate and indeterminate 
growth form of erect dayflower results in harvests of very 
small quantities of seed.  This makes commercial 
production of large quantities of seed uneconomical, and 
limits its use for large-scale seeding and plantings.

each end.  There is an occasional compound leaf 
form variation.  The leaf blades are deeply cut into 20 
or more rounded lobes, dark green above, paler and 
hair-covered beneath and on the midrib and margin 
above.  Resinous glands cover both surfaces.  Leaves 
are very aromatic when crushed.  The flowers are 
small, inconspicuous catkins that bloom during April 
and May.  Flowers of one or both sexes can be 
produced on an individual plant.  The male catkins 
are rather long and cylindrical. the female catkins are 
short and rounded.  In winter, the male catkins are 
prominent and erect.  The female catkins become 
bur-like at maturity and are 1/2 inch in diameter.  The

streambank erosion control, four to six feet apart for 
wildlife habitat.  Establishment with other species, 
such as willow and other riparian species, is a good 
practice.  On sites with banks that may become dry

the water, with willows above.  Immediately after 
planting, grasses and legumes may be planted to 
provide initial stabilization.  After 2 or 3 years the 
dogwoods will become effective.  The cultivar  Ruby  
is vulnerable to livestock browsing.  In order to 
ensure survival, fencing must be incorporated into the 
plan. 
Redosier dogwood can also be mixed with willows in 
soil bioengineering methods.  Stems can be used in 
live fascines, brush layering and brush mattressing. 
Rooted hardwood cuttings are taken in January, 
allowed to develop callus in refrigerated storage, and 
planted in mid-May in well drained soil 2 inches 
apart.  The cuttings should be 1/4-1/2 inch in 
diameter and 9 to 12 inches long.  They should be

road bank stabilization in areas where rocky

East, it may conceal the problem, since rill and gully 
erosion can occur under the crownvetch canopy in 
these areas.  Crown vetch has been successfully used 
with switchgrass on dry sites in the East, forming an 
understory but providing nitrogen.  Rapid soil 
organic matter improvement has occured with this 
species combination, which stabilizes soil better than 
crownvetch used alone. in general, however, 
crownvetch dominates other plants and tends toward 
a monoculture.   
Livestock: Crownvetch produces palatable high 
quality forage for all classes of livestock either as hay 
or pasture.  There is little or no bloat hazard in 
grazing crownvetch.

In mix plantings, use 15 to 20 pounds of crownvetch

protect the site while the slower growing legume is 
getting established.  Seeding in the spring is best.  Do 
not seed after mid-summer.  Sites ready for seeding 
in late summer or fall can be seeded to grass and 
mulched, and the crownvetch over-seeded the 
following spring.  Sites too steep or stony to use 
mechanical equipment usually can be seeded without 
site preparation if “frost seeded”.  Soil conditions 
must have a favorable soil reaction of pH 5.5 and be

Normally, crownvetch will not make sufficient 
growth for use the first year, but should be clipped 
for weed control.  Remove first hay harvest about 10 
to 14 days after first flowers appear.  Leave a six inch 
stubble as new growth will come from buds on the 
stems.  The second harvest will come about 8 to 9 
weeks later.  Drying the hay may be more of a 
problem than with other legumes.  Artificial means 
should be utilized.  Begin grazing about the same 
time as cutting for hay.  Recovery may be more rapid 
after grazing than after hay cutting as livestock will 
eat the leaves and let the long stems remain.  New 
growth will initiate from the many buds on the stems.  
Rotate grazing and regraze after 10 to 14 inches of 
growth is made.  Mature crownvetch is a little more 
palatable than most other legumes, therefore it can be 
stockpiled to take advantage of other forages.  
Nutritional value decreases with maturity.

Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
 
Description and Adaptation 
 Description: A member of the Rosaceae family, the May 
Hawthorn is a deciduous, small, round- topped tree 
growing to 30 feet in height. Leaves are dark green, 
simple, and are alternately arranged.. Flowers are white 
and produced either singly or in clusters of 2 or 3.The 
fruit is a fleshy, red pome borne in May, contributing to 
the common name “Mayhaw”. Twigs are brown to gray 
and spiny. 
  
 
May Hawthorn distribution from USDA-NRCS PLANTS 
Database. 
Adaptation: While preferring full sun, Eastern May 
Hawthorn will tolerate partial shade. Once established it 
will also tolerate wet soils and drought conditions. It will 
grow in a variety of soil types, but preferring well 
drained, slightly acid soils. Their tolerances to air 
pollution make it a good choice for urban sites. 
For updated distribution, please consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
 
 
 


Page 2
 
 
Establishment 
Under natural conditions Eastern May Hawthorn seeds do 
not germinate until overwintered. Successful seed 
germination requires acid stratification followed by warm 
stratification and chilling. Propagation can also be done 
using softwood stem cuttings rooted under an intermittent 
mist. The use of a rooting hormone will increase rooting 
success.   
 
Propagation from hardwood and root cuttings is also 
possible. Grafting to English Hawthorn   (Crataegus 
oxyacantha or Single Seeded Hawthorn (Crataegus 
monogyna   rootstock is possible but should be done in 
winter or early spring. 
Management 
Annual pruning in the winter to open up the tree canopy 
will be beneficial in increasing fruit production. In 
addition weak branches and sucker stems should be 
removed at this time. 
Pests and Potential Problems 
May Hawthorn is susceptible to some of the same insects 
and diseases that attack other pome fruits. These include 
insects such as the hawthorn lace bug and roundheaded 
appletree borer along with leafminers and mealy bugs. 
Diseases affecting May Hawthorn include fire-blight, 
cedar-hawthorn blight, cedar quince blight and fruit rot.

Plant Fact Sheet
Description and Adaptation 
 
 
Kansas hawthorn distribution from USDA-NRCS PLANTS Database. 
 
General: A spiny large shrub or small tree that is reported 
to be up to 20 feet tall. However, a specimen tree planted 
in the Brooklyn Botanical Garden in 1912 is officially 
recognized as the biggest tree of  its species on record in 
the state of New York. The tree topped out at 31 feet tall 
and has a 36 inch basal circumference. Leaves are 
alternate, simple, broadly ovate 2.4 to 3.0 inches long and 
2.0 to 2.4 inches wide, pubescent when young, turning 
glabrous with age, dull dark green above, paler beneath, 
base variable, apex acute, margin serrate or doubly serrate 
with several shallow lobes above the middle. The bark is 
dark brown and scaly. The twigs are lustrous brown, 
glabrous with many spines up to two inches long. Flowers 
are white and produced in flat topped inflorescences, 
termed corymbs, of 5 to 7 flowers. The flowers have five 
petals and styles and 20 stamens with rose colored 
anthers. Fruits are pomes that are nearly globe shaped and 
bright red at maturity, each contains five seeds or nutlets.    
 
Adaptation: Kansas hawthorn is best adapted to dry 
uplands on limestone hillsides. While it can succeed in 
partial shade and various soil types it prefers full sun and 
well drained loamy soils.  
 
Distribution: Kansas hawthorn grows from southern 
Illinois and Missouri to eastern Kansas and Oklahoma and 
into Arkansas. This species is uncommon in Oklahoma. 
 
For updated distribution, please consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site.

Materials Program Web site &lt.http://plant-
materials.nrcs.usda.gov&gt. 
Establishment 
Kansas hawthorn can be propagated either by seed or 
grafting. Successful propagation from seed is the best 
alternative, but will require several intermediate steps 
such as acid scarification, warm stratification and cold 
moist stratification of the seed units to induce 
germination. This proposed series of treatments may be 
necessary due to the fact that Crataegus species possess 
what is termed double dormancy. Thus it is necessary to 
overcome two separate types of dormancy in order for the 
species to successfully germinate. No precise germination 
protocols have been worked out for Kansas hawthorn 
since it is considered a minor species with limited 
commercial value.  
 
Grafting onto seedling stock of Crataegus oxyacantha or 
Crataegus monogyna is best performed in the winter or 
early spring. 
 
Management 
Pruning should be accomplished in the winter or early 
spring in order to maintain a strong central leader. 
Pruning should remove weak branches to allow light to 
penetrate the tree and root suckers or sprouts should be 
removed as needed. Seedlings should not be kept in a 
nursery situation for more than a year to reduce damage to 
the strong tap root system.  
 
Pests and Potential Problems: The most common 
disease problems of hawthorn are rust, fireblight and leaf 
spot. Rust and leaf spot are caused by fungi and fireblight 
is a bacterial disease. Cedar – hawthorn rust is a 
particularly troubling problem in landscapes where 
Juniper species are planted near hawthorn species. The 
disease requires both plant species to complete its life 
cycle and the hawthorn species is devastated with foliage 
destruction to the point that the plants may be severely 
defoliated by late in the growing season. This 
combination of plant species should not be used in the 
same landscape planting.  
Insect pests are not a serious problem on Kansas 
hawthorn, but may cause leaf and fruit damage on the 
tree. 
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
Consult  local  nurseries  to  choose  the  right  cultivar  for 
your intended use of the plant material.

marginal adaptability. 
Beds for seeding or planting should be firm, smooth, 
and free of weed seed.  For turf plantings, absolute 
smoothness is necessary for close mowing following 
establishment.  Seed, sprigs, or plugs should be 
placed into moist soil.  
For pasture or hay, drill 3 pounds pure live seed per 
acre at 1/2 inch depth or less.  For turf, use 10 pounds 
of seed per acre.  Higher seeding rates are advisable 
if seed must be broadcast.  If using sprigs, broadcast 
by hand or with hydro-equipment.  Punching and 
irrigation, if needed, must be done immediately 
following spreading to keep the sprigs from drying 
out.  Surface soil moisture must be kept high while 
roots and shoots develop at the sprig nodes. 
Fifteen bushels of sprigs per acre disk punched or 
covered with 1-1/2 inches of soil followed by 
irrigation as needed ordinarily gives fully established 
stands in one growing season.  On saline soils 
planting in the side of furrows is desirable so salts 
will accumulate on the ridges above grass rows. 
Use of sod rolls or plugs cut from sod is often a 
preferred method of establishing turf-type Bermuda 
on critical sites.  Plugs of 3 inch diameter planted on 
15 to 18 inch centers will ordinarily establish 
complete cover in 1 growing season with adequate 
fertilizer, moisture and half-day to full sun.  
Complete sodding is preferred for very critical areas

Care immediately following planting is less critical 
on plantings of sod or plugs than turf-type sprigs.

High quality turf will require frequent very low 
mowing, fertilizer, and water for vigorous growth.

mower will avoid unsightly scalping.  Good to fair 
quality turf can be maintained on short water and low 
fertilizer schedules, thereby reducing mowing 
frequency. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bermudagrass will persist as a weed-free ground 
cover on soils of moderate to high water-holding 
capacity. Where desirable and permissible, mid-
winter controlled burning can be used to reduce 
thatch.  Most herbicides used at recommended rates 
with reasonable care can be used to control 
undesirable plants without destroying fully 
established Bermudagrass.  Applications of nitrogen 
every 2 to 5 years will be needed to maintain 
vigorous stands on most sites. 
Both pasture and hay require good rainfall and heavy 
fertilizer application for high yield and quality.  
Thirty to forty pounds of nitrogen should be applied 
in split increments for each ton of anticipated dry 
forage yield.  Highest yields are obtained on good 
soils in areas of high average annual temperature

and the grains are consumed by birds and mammals. 
 
As a rangeland plant, California oatgrass is well 
utilized by livestock.  Prior to maturity, it is rated as 
good to very good forage for cattle and horses in the 
Pacific Coast states, but less palatable for sheep and 
goats.  Ratings are lower for eastern, drier portions of 
its natural range.  Plants withstand heavy grazing but 
can be overgrazed leading to their depletion.  Protein 
analysis is high and stands have formed that are 
dense enough for haying.  Other potential uses 
include cover and erosion control in vineyards, young 
orchards, and parks, as well as along trails.  As a 
candidate for native lawn, this species can be mowed 
to maintain a turf-like stand.  It takes heavy foot 
traffic, trampling, and moderate summer moisture 
stress and can act as a stay-green firebreak.

to densely hairy.  Leaves are both basal and attached 
to the stem.  The upper blades are flat to in-rolled and 
spreading to abruptly bent with distinct spreading 
hairs where they meet the stem.  The panicle (seed 
head) flowers between May and early July and is 3-8 
cm long, loose, and open with 1-6 broadly spreading 
spikelets.  Awns (linear appendages) on the seed are 
abruptly bent and 4-12 mm long.  Seed is produced 
both in the terminal panicle and at the lower nodes 
enclosed (hidden) within the leaf sheaths of the stem. 
California oatgrass can be confused with timber 
oatgrass (Danthonia intermedia), poverty oatgrass

have been reported.  The species has few significant 
pests but is one of many hosts for blind seed disease 
(Gloeotinia temulenta), a potentially serious pest in 
ryegrass (Lolium spp.) fields grown for seed. 
 
' WHERE symbol='daca3';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD fs_Establishment_ TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_Establishment_='  Growing California oatgrass from 
seed can be problematic as the result of delayed or 
sporadic germination and moderately slow seedling 
development combined with early competition from 
other species.  The variable germination rates are the 
result of either a seed coat imposed dormancy, 
physiological (embryo) dormancy, no dormancy, or a 
combination of all three.  To determine the amount of 
dormancy in a seed lot, both a TZ (tetrazolium) test 
for viability and germination test should be run.  The 
difference between the two indicates the amount of 
dormancy.  To overcome high dormancy, good 
germination will require fall sowing to cold moist 
stratify the seed outdoors over winter (alternatively, 
moist stratify in a cooler for 30-120 days at 1-4°F), 
scarification of the seed coat to weaken it, or both.  
Proven methods of scarification (sulfuric acid 
treatment, abrasion with sandpaper, use of a huller-
scarifier or brush machine) each have their 
limitations.  Hull removal (dehulling) and awn 
removal are coincidental to the process.  Mechanical 
 
 
methods must be gentle enough to prevent damage to 
the seed embryo.  An oat huller may be an option.  
 
Keys to establishment for revegetation and other 
purposes are preplant weed control and proper 
seedbed preparation such as 1-3 years of fallow.   
Besides tillage and herbicides, site preparation 
methods and weed and stand management options 
include prescribed fire, grazing, mowing, or 
combinations thereof.  The most successful stands are 
often achieved by sowing the seed alone rather than 
in a mix, succeeded by the use of a nonselective 
herbicide such as glyphosate to kill new weeds before 
the California oatgrass seedlings emerge following 
delayed germination.  Very shallow soil coverage 
(1/4 inch or less) is critical because of the seed’s light 
requirement.  There are 90,000-165,000 seeds/lb 
depending on the degree of processing and natural 
variation.  Each 1 lb of pure live seed (PLS) sown per 
acre results in 2-4 live seeds/ft2.  Sown alone, the 
suggested seeding rate for drilling is 9-15 PLS lbs/ac.  
The rate is doubled for broadcast seeding.  A starter 
fertilizer is usually not recommended as it encourages 
excessive weed competition but a thin covering of 
mulch or jute netting is particularly useful on steeper 
banks.  California oatgrass propagates readily by 
division.  Plugs grown in standard potting media have 
worked better than direct seeding in many situations.

upright branches near the top. The stems are ridged 
or ribbed longitudinally. The bright green, alternately 
attached leaves are pinnately compound with an odd 
number (usually 5 to 9) of narrow leaflets. The 
leaflets have glandular dots on their lower surface 
that can be seen with magnification. Flowering 
occurs from early to mid-June to July or August in 
Kansas. The small white flowers are packed into 
dense cylindrical spikes (3/8 to 2 1/8 inches) on the 
terminal ends of stems. The flowers are much 
simplified from the typical pea-like flowers of the 
legume family with most petals being reduced except 
for a single banner petal. The first flowers to open are 
at the bottom of the spike and progress upward 
toward the tip. Pollination is accomplished by 
numerous insects ranging from wasps to bumble 
bees. The fruit is a thin-walled pod (legume) 
approximately 1/8 of an inch long containing a single 
seed (rarely two). The greenish-brown seed is 
asymmetrically kidney shaped and a little more than 
1/16 inch long.  
 
This species is found growing primarily on well 
drained sandy, gravelly, and silt type soils, rarely on 
clay or lowland sites. It occurs on sites that receive

enough to allow planting at a ¼ to ½ inch depth. Full 
seeding rate is 4 pounds per acre. however, this 
species will normally be planted as a minor 
component in a native seed mixture at a rate of .5 
pound per acre or less. Seeding of the forb

Weed management during the first year

white prairie clover seedlings is one method of 
reducing weed competition. White prairie clover has 
good relative forage quality, but suffers from having 
relatively low forage yield when compared to other 
native legume species. White prairie clover should 
improve forage digestibility when planted in pasture 
situations with native warm season grasses. Native 
legumes such as white prairie clover fix nitrogen 
from the atmosphere and make it available to grass

Plant Fact Sheet
Pollinator habitat: Dalea ornata attracts native bee fauna 
as well as managed agricultural pollinators.   
Beautification:  This plant is an excellent choice for 
beautification of roadsides, rest areas and parks. 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
Description and Adaptation 
General: Legume family (Fabaceae).  Western prairie 
clover is a perennial, herbaceous North American legume 
that grows to 12 – 24 inches in height.  It has a cluster of 
stems that arise from a taproot.  Dried stems are also 
usually present from previous years.  Leaves are alternate 
and odd-pinnate, comprised of 5 – 7 oval shaped leaflets.  
Leaves and stems are dotted with tiny glands.  Flowers 
occur in dense, cylinder-shaped spikes, are light pink to 
purple in color and have 5 petals.  The flowers bloom 
upward along the spike May – July.  Seedpods are closed 
and contain 1 or 2 seeds.   
 
Distribution: Western prairie clover is native to 
southeastern Washington, western Idaho, eastern Oregon, 
northern California and northwestern Nevada.  It is 
relatively uncommon.

Habitat: Western prairie clover is found in sagebrush-
steppe habitats in the southern Columbia Plateau, the Blue 
Mountains and the northern Great Basin.  It is adapted to 
low to moderate elevations and is characteristic of soft 
clay and sandy soils derived from weathering of basalt 
and volcanic ash (Barneby 1977).   
Establishment 
To establish a planting, the seed must first be scarified 
using sandpaper or a laboratory scarifying device.  Seed 
also can be scarified by soaking in 98% sulfuric acid, 
rinsed with water and air-dried.  The seed should be 
planted with a drill into a prepared, firm, weed-free seed 
bed at a depth of ¼ - ½ inch and at a rate of 4 – 5 pounds 
Pure Live Seed (PLS) per acre.  If the seed is planted in a 
mix, the seeding rate should be adjusted according to the 
proportion of the mix. If the seed is broadcast, the seeding 
rate should be doubled.  To improve the plant s ability to 
establish and fix nitrogen, the seed should be inoculated 
with the proper Rhizobium bacteria strain prior to 
planting. 
Management 
In all native forb plantings, weeds must be managed for 
several years to ensure successful establishment.  
Integrated Pest Management (IPM) techniques such as 
herbicide use and mowing could be used. 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Seedlings of Dalea ornata may be damaged by rodents 
and insects. 
Environmental Concerns 
This plant does not appear to spread aggressively by seed 
or vegetative means.

Description   
Purple prairie clover is a native, warm-season, perennial 
legume.  The plant has one to many stems that grow up to 
2.5 feet long from a woody, stout taproot that branches 
near the surface.  The leaves are about one inch long and 
very narrow.  They alternate and have an average of five 
leaflets per pinnate compound.  The flowers appear on the 
end of the stems and have cylindrical floral spikes about 
two inches long.  The flowers open beginning at the base 
of the flower head and progress up to the tip.  Seed is 
produced in a seed pod about ½ inch long.  The seed pod 
will contain between one to two seed each.  Purple prairie 
clover blooms from April to June with the seed maturing 
from mid July to late August   
  
Adaptation  
Purple prairie clover is adapted to slopes along hillsides, 
prairies, and plains.  The plant is widely distributed 
throughout central, south, and west Texas.  It occurs 
mostly on sandy, sandy loam, and other moderately 
drained soils

Establishment  
Purple prairie clover should be planted on a clean, firm 
seedbed.  Planting can be done using either a grass drill or 
broadcast seeder, but grass drills are the most successful 
method of planting.  Seed should be placed ½ to ¼ inch 
deep.  Purple prairie clover should be planted at a rate of 
3 lbs pure live seed (pls) per acre. When planting this as a 
component of a seed mixture, the seeding rate should be 
adjusted to the desired percent of the mix.  
 
Management  
Purple prairie clover is commonly found as a component 
in  seed  mixtures  for  range  seeding  and  conservation 
cover.  Stands should be well established before livestock 
grazing  is  permitted.    The  plant  does  not  tolerate 
continuous  grazing  or  heavy  overuse. 
  Proper 
management of purple prairie clover is required to ensure 
the plant is not overgrazed or over utilized by livestock or 
wildlife.    Consult  your  local  NRCS  Field  Office  for 
assistance with planning and applying prescribed grazing.  
Soil tests should be conducted regularly to determine the 
amount of fertilizer needed to maintain a medium level of 
fertility.

TUFTED HAIRGRASS  
Deschampsia cespitosa (L.) P. Beauv.  
Plant Symbol = DECE 
 
Contributed by: USDA NRCS Plant Materials Center, 
Corvallis, Oregon  
 
 
Photo by Dale Darris 
 
Alternate names  
Other common names include blue-green hair-grass, 
fescue-leaved hairgrass, salt and pepper grass, 
tussock grass, and canche cespiteuse.   
  
Uses  
Tufted hairgrass is useful for restoring moist to 
seasonally wet prairies and stabilizing disturbed 
sites, streambanks, canals, shorelines, and upper 
tidal marshes. Other applications include acid and 
heavy metal mine spoil reclamation, alpine and 
boreal revegetation work, and bio-filtration swales.  
As a range or pasture grass, it is both a desirable, 
productive forage for cattle and sheep particularly at 
higher elevations, and a species of lesser or low 
value in regions where plants are coarse and less 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
palatable.  The species is sometimes cut for hay.  
Utilization by deer, elk, pronghorn, bison, bear, 
horses, and rabbits is variable.  Likewise, cover and 
food values are rated poor to good for small 
mammals, upland game birds, songbirds, and 
waterfowl depending on wildlife species and 
location. Tufted hairgrass is a larval food plant for 
several butterflies in North America and is host for 
at least 40 species of Lepidopteran insects world-
wide. Varieties have been bred as wear resistant turf 
for golf courses, sports fields and other uses.  
  
Description  
Tufted hairgrass is a highly variable, perennial cool 
season species that grows 20 to 60 in. tall.  Stems are 
erect and the leaves are .06 to .16 in. wide, flat or 
rolled, and mostly basal in a dense tuft.  The panicle 
(seed head or inflorescence) is upright to nodding, 
loosely branched, open, and 4 to 10 in. long. There 
are two florets (flowers) per spikelet. Flowering 
occurs from May to September and seeds mature 
from late June to late September depending on 
location.  
    
Status  
Please consult the Plants Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s 
current status, such as state noxious and wetland 
indicator values.  
  
Adaptation  
Populations occupy moderately moist to seasonally 
flooded, sunny to partially shaded environments 
with a wide variety of soil types (fine to coarse, 
mesic to hydric) and pH ranging from 3.5 to 7.5. 
Some populations have extreme tolerance to heavy 
metals and high soil acidity.  Salinity tolerance is 
generally considered low, but plants occurring in 
coastal estuaries may be slightly more salt tolerant.  
Crowns typically survive all but the most severe or 
hottest fires.  
Distribution-As one of the most widely distributed 
grasses on earth, tufted hairgrass is found in many 
arctic and temperate regions. It occurs from sea level 
to 14,000 ft in the mountains.  Habitats include 
coastal terraces, upper tidal marshes, seasonally wet 
prairies, moist subalpine mountain meadows, open 
forests, and alpine areas above timberline.

Limitations or environmental concerns  
Tufted hairgrass is 
host to a number of 
diseases including 
ergot, several rusts, 
stripe smut, blind 
seed, several leaf 
spots, and the turf 
disease take all patch. 
Insect pests typical of 
pasture and turf 
grasses include 
aphids, billbugs, 
leafhoppers, and 
others. In some parts 
of the world, this 
grass spreads readily 
into newly disturbed 
areas, is a weed in 
certain forage crops, 
and can become a 
serious competitor 
with trees.   
 
 
 
Reprinted with permission Univ. of 
WA Press 
Specific management practices are applied to wet, 
low elevation pastures in Europe in order to control 
it.  The plant is considered nontoxic to livestock and 
humans.  Uses such as general cover and turf can be 
limited by summer moistustress and billbugs.  
 
Establishment   
While the seed (1.1 to 2.5 million seeds/lb) from 
alpine environments may have dormancy and does 
better if fall sown, low elevation sources typically 
have low dormancy and can be fall or spring planted.  
Slow to establish the first year, tufted hairgrass 
originating at low elevations in the Pacific 
Northwest can become large and dominate a site by 
the end of the second growing season if sown 
heavily (2 to 3 lbs of pure live seed/ac).  Where 
species diversity is a goal, space for forbs and other 
grasses may require that seed mixes contain no more 
than ¼ to ½ lb of tufted hairgrass seed per acre. Turf 
varieties are sown at 1 to 2 lbs/1000 sq. ft. Light 
enhances germination so seeds should be only 
lightly covered (¼ in.). Choose seed originating 
from the same region and a similar elevation range 
(low, mid, or high).  Specific populations are often 
 
required for extreme soils (acid, metals). 
Depauperate sties may need mulch and fertilizer.   
Grazing management- Once established, use a 
rotational, moderate grazing system since the species 
often declines with continuous, season long use. 
Defer grazing each spring until soils are dry enough 
to prevent damage to soils and plants. Also, 
postpone livestock utilization for a year or more 
after fire to allow recovery.    
  
Improved cultivars and selected materials (and 
area of origin)  
The NRCS in Oregon released the pre-varieties 
Tillamook Germplasm for revegetation use in 
coastal zones of Oregon and Washington, and 
Willamette Germplasm for use in western interior 
valleys of the same states. Reclamation cultivars 
include ‘Peru Creek’ from Colorado for use in 
certain Rocky Mountain habitats, and ‘Nortran’ for 
use in parts of Alaska. Given the fine wispy seed 
heads and natural beauty of the plant, 20 or more 
ornamental varieties are found in the landscape and 
nursery trade. Seed companies have developed at 
least eight proprietary turf varieties from European 
sources that reportedly tolerate more shade and 
mowing down to 1/3 to 1/2 in.

Spotted Skipper (Epargyreus clarus), Southern 
Cloudywing (Thorybes bathyllus), and Northern 
Cloudywing (Thorybes pylades).  The caterpillars of the 
butterfly Eastern Tailed Blue (Everes comyntas) also feed 
on the foliage, while the caterpillars of the butterfly Gray 
Hairstreak (Strymon melinus) eat the flowers and 
developing seedpods.  Other insect feeders include many 
kinds of beetles, and some species of thrips, aphids, moth 
caterpillars, and stinkbugs.  The seeds are eaten by some 
upland game birds (Bobwhite Quail, Wild Turkey) and 
small rodents (White-Footed Mouse, Deer Mouse), while 
the foliage is readily eaten by White-Tailed Deer and 
other hoofed mammalian herbivores.  The Cottontail 
Rabbit also consumes the foliage.

Description and Adaptation 
Hairy Small-Leaf Ticktrefoil is a native, perennial, 
wildflower that grows up to 3 feet tall.  The name of the 
genus Desmodium originates from Greek meaning &quot.long 
branch or chain,&quot. probably from the shape of the seedpods 
and the way they attach to clothing and animals.  The 
central stem is green with trifoliate (clover-like), oblong, 
compound (made up of multiple green leaflets), green 
leaves proceeding singly up the stem.  The showy purple 
flowers appear in late summer and grow from panicles 
(flowers arranged on a stem) that mature from the bottom 
upwards.  In early fall, the flowers produce leguminous 
seed pods approximately ⅛ inch long.  Hairy Small-Leaf 
Ticktrefoil plants have a single crown.  This wildflower is 
a pioneer species that prefers some disturbance from 
wildfires, selective logging, and other causes.  The sticky 
seedpods cling to the fur of animals and the clothing of 
humans. as a result, the seeds are carried to new locations.  
Hairy Small-Leaf Ticktrefoil grows in upland habitats 
such as forests and savannahs.  It prefers coarse- to 
medium- textured soils that are well-drained.

Annual hairgrass is a fine textured, native, cool 
season grass with smooth, slender stems (culms) that 
are 10 to 60 cm tall.  The form is upright to 
spreading, short, and somewhat tufted.  The narrow 
leaf blades are hairless, rough on the edges, slightly 
in-rolled, 0.5 to 1.5 (2) mm wide, and 1 to 10 cm 
long.  Flower heads (panicles) are open, 7 to 25 cm 
long, with ascending lower branches.  Annual 
hairgrass occurs from near sea level at the coast to 
8000 feet in the Rocky Mountains.  It is primarily 
found from Alaska south to Baja California and east 
to Montana and New Mexico. also the Northeast US 
and Chile. ' WHERE symbol='deda';

UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_='Key to identification: Annual hairgrass can be 
distinguished from slender hairgrass (Deschampsia

it may be confused with other annual grasses, such as 
annual fescues (Vulpia spp.).  Both may occur in 
waste areas.  Consult botanical keys for proper 
identification.  
 
Relative abundance in wild:  While most common in 
the Pacific Coast states, the species can still be hard 
to locate.  However, it can occur in large stands, 
especially in vernal pools dominated by annuals.  
Seed retention is fair and fill is good.  The period for

Annual hairgrass germinates readily and is easy to 
establish on open, moist ground.  There is no seed 
dormancy and therefore no requirement for 
physiological conditioning or over wintering 
outdoors.  However, as a winter annual in milder 
growing climes of the West Coast, it is best suited to 
early fall sowing.  The seed should be run through a 
debearder or brush machine to remove pubescence 
(hairs).  This will accentuate further seed cleaning 
and improve flow through a drill and other planting 
device.  There are approximately 900,000 seeds per 
pound (+/- 30%).  A seeding rate of 1 lb/acre pure 
live seed (PLS) would result in 20 live seeds per 
square foot.  Seeding rates will vary widely

UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_='Description and Adaptation 
Slender hairgrass is a moderate sized, fine textured, 
cool season grass. It is generally a biennial or short-
lived perennial under most conditions.  Stems 
(culms) are 40 to 80 (100) cm tall. Leaves are hair-
like, less than 1.5 mm wide, and form a basal tuft. 
The open sheaths are smooth and auricles are absent. 
The panicle (flowerhead) is 5 to 25 (30) cm long, 
narrow with slender upward-pointing branches, and a 
pale green to purple color.  This species occurs 
primarily from Alaska to California and east to 
Montana and New Mexico. 
 
Key to identification: The slender, upright to arching 
seed head and fine leaves are indicative of its 
common name.  It should not be confused with tufted 
hairgrass (Deschampsia caespitosa) which is taller, 
coarser, and more robust.  In addition, the panicles of 
tufted hairgrass are more open and branching, and the 
leaves are broader and flatter than slender hairgrass. 
Annual hairgrass (Deschampsia danthonioides) is 
smaller and the panicle is also much broader and 
open compared to slender hairgrass. Because of the 
fine texture and small florets, it may loosely resemble 
a bentgrass (Agrostis sp.) without closer inspection.  
 
Relative abundance in the wild: Scattered to 
relatively common but rarely in large numbers.  
Slender hairgrass is occasionally found in drainage 
ways, seep areas, ditches, and damp open woods, as 
well as adjacent to moist pathways or other disturbed 
areas.  
 
Adaptation: Slender hairgrass can be found in wet 
meadows and along the margins of streams, ponds, 
and lakes. Habitat also includes moist slopes and the 
understory of open forests from lowland to alpine 
zones. It is also a component of coastal prairies. As a 
species of secondary plant succession, slender 
hairgrass re-establishes after logging in associated 
forest communities. It is found on fine sandy or

Alternate Names 
Panicle tick-trefoil, perplexed tick-trefoil, tall tick clover, 
Diclinous   tick-trefoil (Connecticut), smooth tick-trefoil  
  
Uses 
The  seeds  of  the  Dillenius’  Tick-Trefoil  are  eaten  by 
upland  game  birds,  small  rodents,  wild  turkey,  rabbits, 
groundhogs  and  livestock.  It  is  also  an  excellent  deer 
browse.  
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g. threatened or endangered species, stae noxious 
status, and wetland indicator value.)  
 
Description 
Dillenius’ tick trefoil is a member of the pea family.  This 
native  perennial  forb  grows  between  2  ½  to  5  feet  in 
height. Its tiny flowers are pink or purple and irregular in

shape  and  have  no  floral  scent.    The  flowers  turn  light 
blue  when  spent.  Bloom  time  is  from  mid-summer  to 
early  fall  and  lasts  about  a  month.        The  leaves  are 
alternate, composed of three entire leaflets.  They are egg 
shaped with little or no point.  There is little or no stipule 
where the leaf is attached to the stem. The seed pods are 
covered with tiny hooked hairs that enable them to stick 
to  the  fur  of  passing  animals  and  the  fabric  of  humans, 
thus providing a mechanism for dispersal.  Long tongued 
bees are the primary pollinators. 
 
Adaptation and Distribution 
This tick trefoil prefers partial sun and dry to slightly dry 
conditions.    It  usually  grows  in  soil  that  contains  loam, 
clay-loam,  or  some  kind  of  rocky  material.    Its  habitats 
include  savannas,  rocky  upland  forest,  edges  of  wooded 
areas,  thickets,  and  limestone  glades.  Its  range  is  from 
New England to Minnesota and from Florida to Texas.  It 
is common throughout the Midwest States. 
 For  a  current  distribution  map,  please  consult  the  Plant 
Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web site.  
 
Establishment 
A  clean,  firm  seedbed  is  essential  for  establishing 
Dillenius’ Tick-Trefoil.  A good seedbed can be prepared 
by  disking  and  harrowing,  following  by  cultipacking.  
Planting into no-till conditions can be effective provided 
weeds  are  controlled  and  residue  is  managed  prior  to 
planting.    Good  seed-to-soil  contact  is  important  for 
germination and establishment. 
 
The seedbed should be firm enough to allow the seed to 
be planted ⅛” to ¼” deep.  Cultipacker seeders and band 
seeders  followed  by  press  wheels  or  a  cultipacker  help 
ensure  shallow  seed  placement  and  good  seed-to-soil 
contact. 
  Apply  fertilizer  (especially  phosphorus  or 
potassium) only as recommended by a soil test.  Nitrogen 
fertilizer is not recommended during establishment year. 
 
Inoculating  seeds  with  Rhizobium  before  planting  is 
recommended.

This species is a member of the legume family 
(Fabaceae). It is a warm season, herbaceous, 
perennial leguminous forb. Multiple stems grow from 
a woody caudex which is in turn attached to the deep 
tap root system of this species. The erect stems are 
smooth, angular, and grooved. The plant stands 1.5 to 
4.25 feet tall when mature. Its doubly compound 
leaves are attached to the stems in an alternate 
arrangement. Leaves are sensitive to external 
stimulation such as sunlight or touch which causes 
the leaflets to fold inward, thus giving the plant the 
common name false sensitive plant. The white 
flowers contain five sepals, petals and stamens and 
are borne in “powder puff” globose heads. The self 
pollinated flowers produce clustered flat scythe-
shaped pods each about 1 to 1 1/2 inches long and 
containing two to six seeds. The pods generally split 
open at maturity and the brown seeds are expelled or 
at least in a position to be scattered by wind or 
wildlife.  
 
Illinois bundleflower plants are most often found in 
prairie remnants, sloughs, woodland edges or 
disturbed areas. The plant thrives on medium 
textured soils and is tolerant of most soil types except 
heavy clays and exceptionally coarse sands. It grows 
more vigorously and is more abundant in a 20 inch or 
greater rainfall zone. Good drought tolerance can be 
expected in open communities with reduced levels of 
competition. Bundleflower is normally found 
growing in association with tall warm-season grasses.

Alternate Names 
Panicled Tick Trefoil 
Uses 
Ethnobotanical: The Houma Indians of Louisiana used an 
infusion of the roots in whiskey to treat weakness and 
cramps. 
Landscaping and wildlife:  Panicledleaf Ticktrefoil 
attracts birds and is a good grazing and browsing plant for 
livestock.  Panicledleaf Ticktrefoil enriches the soil 
through nitrogen fixation.  Long-tongued bumblebees 
(Bombus impatien and Bombus pensylvanica ) collect 
pollen from the flowers.  Other long tongued bee 
pollinators include leaf-cutting bees (Megachile brevis 
brevis, Megachile mendica, and Megachile petulans ), and 
digger bees (Melissodes bimaculata bimaculata ). Short 
tongued bee pollinators include: sweat bees (Nomia 
nortoni nortoni) and Campus bees (Calliopsis 
andreniformis). The caterpillars of several skippers feed 
on the leaves: Hoary Edge (Achalarus lyciades), Silver-
Spotted Skipper (Epargyreus clarus), Southern 
Cloudywing (Thorybes bathyllus), and Northern 
Cloudywing (Thorybes pylades).  The caterpillars of the

Plant Fact Sheet
 
Hairstreak (Strymon melinus) eat the flowers and 
developing seedpods. Other insect feeders include many 
kinds of beetles, and some species of thrips, aphids, moth 
caterpillars, and stinkbugs.  The seeds are eaten by some 
upland gamebirds (Bobwhite Quail, Wild Turkey) and 
small rodents (White-Footed Mouse, Deer Mouse), while 
the foliage is readily eaten by White-Tailed Deer and 
other hoofed mammalian herbivores. The Cottontail 
Rabbit also consumes the foliage. 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g. threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
Description and Adaptation  
Panicledleaf Ticktrefoil is a native, perennial, wildflower 
that grows up to 3 feet tall. The genus Desmodium: 
originates from Greek meaning &quot.long branch or chain,&quot. 
probably from the shape and attachment of the seedpods.  
The central stem is green with clover-like, oblong, 
multiple green leaflets proceeding singly up the stem.  
The showy purple flowers appear in late summer and 
grow arranged on a stem maturing from the bottom 
upwards.  In early fall, the flowers produce leguminous 
seed pods approximately ⅛ inch long.  Panicledleaf 
Ticktrefoil plants have a single crown.  This wildflower is 
a pioneer species that prefers some disturbance from 
wildfires, selective logging, and others causes.  The sticky 
seedpods cling to the fur of animals and the clothing of 
humans and are carried to new locations.

Panicledleaf Ticktrefoil grows in upland habitats such as 
forests and savannahs. It prefers coarse to medium 
textured, well drained soils, growing from Maine south to 
Florida and east to Texas and Nebraska.  
Establishment 
Gather seeds in the fall and dry them in paper bags for 1 – 
2 weeks.  Sow seeds directly in fall and plant a cover crop 
of a cool season annual grass over the seedbed to protect 
seed over the winter.  If seeds are to be propagated in a 
container, stratify them for approximately 3 months at 34o 
to 38o F.  Scarify the seeds before planting by rubbing 
them with sandpaper and inoculate them with a 
Desmodium-specific inoculant.  Cover seeds lightly with a 
vermiculite/perlite mixture and keep air temperature at 
approximately 65o
Management 
Panicledleaf Ticktrefoil grows in partial shade and prefers 
neutral to slightly acidic soil, fine to medium textured 
soil.

Desmanthus velutinus Scheele 
Plant Symbol = DEVE2 
Contributed by: USDA NRCS James E. “bud” Smith 
Plant Materials Center, Knox City, Texas 
  
 
Uses  
Wildlife:  Velvet bundleflower is consumed by large and 
small wildlife.  Deer and other browsing animals can feed 
on the young, tender foliage.  The numerous seed 
produced by the plant are utilized by many species, 
especially quail.  
  
Livestock:  Velvet bundleflower has a good forage value 
for sheep and goats while the foliage is young and tender.  
After seed begins to form, the forage value becomes fair 
for all livestock.  
  
Erosion Control:  Velvet bundleflower can be planted 
along field borders, railroads, and other sloping areas to 
reduce soil erosion from both water and wind.  
  
Status  
Please consult the PLANTS Web site 
(http://plants.usda.gov) and your State Department of 
Natural Resources for this plant’s current status (e.g. 
threatened or endangered species, state noxious status, 
and wetland indicator values).  
  
Weediness   
This plant may become weedy or invasive in some 
regions or habitats and may displace desirable vegetation 
if not properly managed.  Please consult your local NRCS

http://www.plants.usda.gov
Related Web Sites and view the plant profile for this 
species for further information.  
  
Description  
Velvet bundleflower is a native, warm-season, perennial 
legume.  The plant is composed of several widely 
spreading, smooth stems that grow two feet long.  Velvet 
bundleflower produces a white “powder-puff” cluster 
shaped flower, one inch in diameter, between the months 
of April and June.  The leaves are three to four inches 
long with a bluish-green tint.  Numerous leaflets 
positioned twice pinnate make up the leaves of the velvet 
bundleflower.  The seed from the velvet bundleflower 
grows in straight pods two to three inches long, and fully 
matures from mid July to late August.    
  
Adaptation  
Velvet bundleflower is widely adapted throughout central, 
south, and west Texas, as well as southern Oklahoma.  It 
prefers calcareous and limestone soils.  Velvet 
bundleflower does not adapt well to heavily wooded areas 
or areas that tend to remain wet for extended periods of 
time.  
  
Distribution: Please consult the Plant Profile page for this 
species on the PLANTS Web site.  
  
Establishment  
Velvet bundleflower should be planted on a clean, firm 
seedbed.  Planting can be done using either a grass drill or 
broadcast seeder, but grass drills are the most successful 
method of planting velvet bundleflower.  Seed should be 
placed ¼ inch deep.  Soil samples should be taken before 
planting to determine the amount of fertilizer needed to 
bring the fertility level up to a medium range.  Limit 
nitrogen application to ten pounds per acre or less until 
the stand is established.  Velvet bundleflower should be 
planted at a rate of 4.5 lbs pure live seed (pls) per acre. 
When planting this as a component of a seed mixture, the 
seeding rate should be adjusted to the desired percent of 
the mix.   
 
 Management  
Velvet bundleflower is commonly found as a component 
in  seed  mixtures  for  range  seeding  and  conservation 
cover.    Stands  of  velvet  bundleflower  should  be  well 
established before livestock is permitted to  graze.  Once 
the stand is established, velvet bundleflower should never

Two seed crops are produced annually: an early crop 
on an open terminal panicle and a later crop in a 
panicle enclosed in the swollen leaf sheath.  The 
second crop, produced in the enclosed panicle, 
produces an abundance of seed.  Deertongue has 
about 400,000 seeds per pound.  Deertongue lodges 
over winter and forms a mat of vegetative cover.  
Some of the stems break off and are carried away by 
wind or water.  Much of the seed is retained in the 
leaf sheaths of the old stems.

VELVET PANICUM 
Dichanthelium scoparium  
(Lam.) Gould 
Plant Symbol = DISC3 
Contributed by: USDA NRCS East Texas Plant Materials 
Center 
 Melinda Brakie - NRCS  
 
 Alternate Names  
Velvet rosettegrass and broom panic-grass are two other 
names for this plant.  
Uses  
Potential uses of velvet panicum include revegetation of 
disturbed areas. This specie provides a source of food for 
songbirds, small mammals, and game birds. The basal 
rosettes provide winter forage for wild turkey and white 
tailed deer.  
Status  
Throughout the adaptation area of the United States, 
velvet panicum is identified as either a facultative (FAC-
equally likely to occur in wetlands or non-wetlands) or 
facultative wetland (FACW- usually occurs in wetlands, 
but occasionally found as a non-wetlands) plant. Please 
consult the PLANTS Web site and your State Department 
of Natural Resources for this plant’s current status (e.g. 
threatened or endangered species, state noxious status, 
and wetland indicator value.  
 
 
 
 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
 Description and Adaptation  
 
This species is distinguished from other North American 
grasses by its unique growth pattern. A basal rosette is 
produced during fall and winter with stems developing in 
the spring.  
Winter basal rosette 
 
Velvet panicum is a native perennial bunchgrass that 
actively grows during the summer. However, the plant’s 
lifespan is considered to be short when compared to other 
perennial plants. It has erect coarse stems up to 4.5 feet 
tall. The gray-green stems and leaves are covered with 
fine hairs. The leaves are .25 to 1.0 inch wide. Velvet 
panicum tends to flower later than the other 
Dichanthelium species if they are present in a stand. 
There are approximately 380,000 seeds per pound.  
Velvet panicum is adapted to the eastern United States 
from New York to Florida west to Kansas and Texas. In 
East Texas, this plant is predominantly found in woods 
and post oak savannahs. This adaptation area corresponds 
to USDA Hardiness Zones 5b to 10b. Velvet panicum 
grows in areas with precipitation ranging from 30 to 55 
inches. It prefers coarse and medium textured soils with 
pH range of 4.5 to 7.5. Velvet panicum is not tolerant of 
salinity. This plant is found in sandy woods, low areas, 
and disturbed sites. 
 Establishment  
Fertilize planting area according to soil test for 
establishment. Maintain fertility levels at medium 
conditions and soil pH near 6.0. To reduce weed 
competition, do not over apply nitrogen.  
Plant the seed at a rate of 3.0 pure live seed pounds per 
acre in the fall when the ground is moist. Drill or hand 
plant seeds at a depth of ½” or less. If broadcasting, use a 
cultipacker to increase seed to soil contact.  
Management  
If managing as a planting: Do not over apply nitrogen 
fertilizer or keep soil fertility at a high level. Seed 
production maybe decreased by high fertility levels. 
 
 
 


Page 2
When managing for seed production, mow in the spring to 
clip off previous year’s growth. 
 
Summer seed harvest is completed using a flail vac or 
combine. The flail vac harvests the mature seed without 
harming the plants. therefore multiple harvests can be 
completed on the same seed production field. At the East 
Texas PMC, summer flail vac harvesting produced 60 
pounds of cleaned seed per acre.  
 
The fall produced seeds are found in the spikelet sheath 
and can be harvested with a combine.  
 
Seed is cleaned using a two screen air seed cleaner with a 
6/64 top screen and a 1/23 bottom screen with very little 
air flow. 
Pests and Potential Problems  
If managing for seed production, velvet panicum will 
hybridize with tapered rosettegrass (D. acuminatum) and 
cypress panicgrass (D. dichotomum).  
Environmental Concerns  
This plant is considered an endangered species in Indiana. 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g. threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values).  
Control  
Velvet panicum spreads slowly by seed. Please contact 
your local agricultural extension specialist or county weed 
specialist to learn what works best in your area and how 
to use it safely. Always read label and safety instructions 
for each control method.  
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin)  
Pilgrim Germplasm velvet panicum (D. scoparium), 
released in 2007 by the East Texas Plant Materials Center,

SALTGRASS 
DISTICHLIS SPICATA 
(L.) GREENE  
Plant Symbol = DISP 
Contributed by: USDA NRCS Cape May Plant Materials 
Center 
 
Photo by William Skaradek USDA NRCS 
 
Alternate Names 
Inland saltgrass, seashore saltgrass, spike grass and alkali 
grass. 
 
Uses 
Livestock: Under favorable soil and moisture conditions, 
studies have shown Saltgrass favorable for pastures 
irrigated with saline water. The total dry matter yields 
were 9081 kg/ha with a total protein production of 1300 
kg/ha.  Saltgrass is grazed by both cattle and horses and it 
has a forage value of fair to good because it remains green 
when most other grasses are dry during the drought 
periods and it is resistant to grazing and trampling.  It is 
cropped both when green and in the dry state. however, it 
is most commonly used the winter for livestock feed.  
Saltgrass along the Atlantic coast was the primary source 
of hay for the early colonists. 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
Wildlife
: Saltgrass is a larval foodplant for the Wandering 
Skipper (Panoquina panoquinoides errans) butterfly. It is 
also an important food in the diet of waterfowl and the 
Florida salt marsh vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus 
dukecampbelli), which is on the Endangered and 
Threatened Species List of Southeastern United States. 
Ducks are reported to occasionally eat the dried seeds and 
controlled burning provides tender forages for wild geese. 
Distichlis spicata is significant in the salt marshes, which 
provide nesting grounds for birds, fish and larvae of many 
species of marine invertebrate animals. As salt marsh 
plants decompose, their stored nutrients provide a steady 
source of food for clams, crabs, and fish. 
 
Wetland Restoration: The thick entangled roots of salt 
marsh plants acts as a guard between the ocean and the 
shore protecting the land from pollutants and other 
chemicals associated with runoff water.  It is particularly 
useful in saline/alkaline wetlands. 
 
Medicine: Saltgrass is a respiratory allergenic plant that is 
offered by Miles Pharmaceutical and used by Florida 
physicians to treat respiratory allergies. 
 
Spice: Indians that inhabited California used saltgrass as a 
seasoning.  They collected the salt crystals by threshing 
the blades.  The seasoning provided is gray-green and said 
to have tasted like a salty dill pickle. 
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g. threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
 
Description  
Saltgrass is a native perennial from 15” to 35” in height.  
It forms dense mats with rhizomes and sometimes stolons.  
It is a dioecious species with male and female 
reproductive parts on separate plants. 
 
It is widespread and in the eastern United States is most 
commonly found along estuaries and the troughs of back 
dune areas along the shorelines. 
 
Distribution: Please consult the Plant Profile page for this 
species on the PLANTS Web site. 
 
Establishment 
Adaptation: Saltgrass is found in saline areas, brackish 
marshes, and in salt flats along the coasts of the Atlantic 
and Pacific Oceans, the Gulf of Mexico and the along the 
coast of South America.  It inhabits upper/high marsh 
 
 
 



Page 2
(irregularly flooded) areas, in which the water levels vary 
between 2 inches above the soil surface and 6 inches 
below the soil surface.  It is also commonly present in the 
dry West, where it is one of the most drought-tolerant 
species.  Saltgrass is located in both organic alkaline and 
in saline soils.  It is found in planting zones 7,8,9,and 10.  
Distichlis spicata can be found in flower from June to 
October.  The inflorescence is yellowish in color, turning 
straw brown as it dries. 
 
General: It may be propagated by seeds, which are 
produced many times in a growing season and are 
dispersed by wind and water.  It is easier and more often 
propagated by its extensively creeping underground 
rhizomes.  
 
Rhizomes: Saltgrass can be established by seeds or by 
rhizome cuttings.  If using rhizome cuttings, they must 
not dry out.  They may be stored up to 28 days.  It is 
recommended that the rhizomes be stored in a 
temperature range of 35-50° F and in 60-75% relative 
humidity.  Rhizomes are can be planted any time of the 
year at a depth of 1-2 inches.  However, rhizomes sprout 
better at 77-86° F. 
 
Seeds: Saltgrass seeds demand more than rhizomes to 
sprout.  The seeds need moist soil, low alkalinity and high 
temperatures.  Although many seeds are produced, only a 
small percentage of those seeds may germinate naturally.   
 
Management 
Saltgrass can be managed by burning between September 
1 and February 1 biannually, when the water level 
exceeds the soil surface.  Following burning, four inches 
of re-growth should be obtained before grazing is 
allowed. Water control systems may need to be installed 
to maintain correct water levels to avoid prolong 
inundation, which kills saltgrass. Cattle walkways are 
usually installed to make the forage more accessible. 
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Saltgrass is the alternate host for the red rust (Puccinia 
aristidae, also known as Puccinia subnitens) that infects 
spinach. Although the red rust disease is difficult for 
shippers to detect, it grows rapidly during transit. Since 
little is known about this disease, there are no 
recommended control techniques.  Saltgrass eradication 
has been the only method used so far because the 
pathogen cannot complete its life cycle without this 
alternate host plant.    
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
‘LK517f saltgrass’ is a California native, perennial, 
warm season grass with extensive creeping, yellowish, 
scaly rhizomes forming large colonies. 
Establishment should be in late spring using rhizomes or 
plugs planted on one-foot centers. Irrigation water should 
be applied the first summer to ensure stand establishment. 
 
 
LK517f is used for riparian restoration and bank and 
shoreline stabilization.

Plant Symbol = DOVI 
 
David Duvauchelle  
USDA NRCS 2004  
Alternate Names  
Aalii, lampuaye, togovao, hopseed bush, and varnish-leaf.   
  
Uses  
Conservation:  The fibrous spreading root system, rapid 
growth,  and  spreading  canopy  make  D.  viscosa  an 
effective  soil  stabilizer  which  is  particularly  useful  in 
controlling gully and coastal dune erosion.  It is drought-
tolerant  and  has  the  ability  to  withstand  wildfires.    D. 
viscosa  shrubs  are  somewhat  shade  tolerant  and  suitable 
for riparian and restoration projects.  They are also very 
wind hardy and useful as an in-field windbreak system.  
  
Landscape:  D. viscosa is an aesthetically pleasing plant.  
It has lush green foliage and deep red capsules that make 
it pleasing to the eye.  D. viscosa may be used as a hedge, 
specimen plant, or maybe a small patio tree.  It is ideal for 
xeriscape gardens.  
  
Cultural:    In  Hawaii,  its  bright  colored  capsules  were 
woven into lei and also used dye.  The wood was used for 
house timbers and for making weapons.  Medicinally, the 
leaves were crushed and applied to treat rashes.  
  
Status  
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g. threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values).  
  
 
Plant Fact Sheet
Description and Adaptation  
Dodonaea  viscosa  is  a  shrub  or  sometimes  a  small  tree 
ranging  in  height  from  6-25  feet.    Its  long  and  slender 
leaves  have  margins  that  are  usually  wavy  or  crinkled.  
Plants usually bloom in the early part of the year and seed 
before  summer.    The  flowers  are  fairly  small  and  the 
female flowers develop into papery capsules that may be 
red, pink, green, yellow, or tan.  Seeds are roundish, black 
and  very  small.  about  1/16  inch  wide.    There  are  about 
84,200 seeds per pound.  D. viscosa is adapted to a wide 
range of habitats, from sea-level to nearly 8,000 feet and 
tolerating  annual  rainfall  of  12-98  inches.    D.  viscosa  is 
found  throughout  the  tropical  regions  of  the  world 
including Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, and Puerto 
Rico.  
  
Distribution: Please consult the Plant Profile page for this 
species on the PLANTS Web site.  
  
Establishment  
It  is  recommended  that  D.  viscosa  be  propagated  in  a 
shade house with 50 percent shade, after the last frost.  To 
aid in germination, seeds can be soaked overnight in hot 
tap water or scarified.  Seeds are planted ¼ inch deep in a 
sterile  medium  and  irrigated  daily.    Dibble  tubes  are 
recommended.  Germination should occur within 10 days.  
Fertilizer can be applied to seedlings at four weeks after 
germination.    After  four  months,  seedlings  should  be 
exposed  to  direct  sunlight  and  allowed  to  adjust  to  the 
new  environment.    The  seedlings  should  be  ready  for 
planting  into  the  field  after  one  month  of  exposure  to 
direct  sunlight.    Some  advantageous  attributes  of  D. 
viscosa, if considering it for conservation use, are that it 
takes well in any kind of soil and it tolerates ocean winds 
and also dry dessert heat.  Water regularly to establish the 
plant,  but  once  it  is  established  it  requires  very  little 
water.    
  
Management  
Trials at the Hoolehua PMC suggest that D. viscosa can 
be planted in single rows at 1-3 foot spacing or six-foot-
staggered double rows, to serve as in-field windbreaks or 
visual screens.  With very light watering D. viscosa will 
remain a smaller 6-8ft shrub.  On the other hand, it may 
attain heights above 15ft if more water is available.  
Mulch paper or some other sort of mulching is 
recommended to aid with weed suppression.  It tolerates 
regular pruning very well if a uniform hedge is desired.  It 
is an ideal plant for conservation because it requires very 
little effort to manage.

Pests and Potential Problems  
In  Hawaii  a  virus  known  as  ‘Dodonaea  yellows’, 
characterized by stunted yellow leaves, distortion of leaf 
margins,  severe  internodal  elongation  of  branches  and 
twigs,  and  eventual  death  of  infected  tissue,  possibly 
including the entire plant.  Flowering and fruiting may be 
diminished  or  absent  on  symptomatic  branches.    Entire 
plants  may  be  affected,  or  the  symptoms  may  occur  on 
individual branches of otherwise normal appearing plants.    
  
Sooty  mold,  ants,  scales,  and  some  leaf-eating  insects 
were  also  observed  on  adult  shrubs  and  are  thought  to 
reduce plant vigor.

Uses 
Creeping burhead is an attractive aquatic plant that is 
recommended for use in shallow ponds and pools.  It may 
also be suitable for use in constructed wetlands.  Wildlife 
benefits have not been documented but it can provide 
some cover for smaller species. 
Status 
Creeping burhead is listed as extirpated in Indiana and 
endangered in Maryland.  This plant is considered an 
obligate wetland indicator species.  Please consult the 
PLANTS Web site and your State Department of Natural 
Resources for this plant’s current status (e.g., threatened 
or endangered species, state noxious status, and wetland 
indicator values). 
Weediness 
This plant may become weedy or invasive in some 
regions or habitats and may displace desirable vegetation 
if not properly managed.  Please consult with your local 
NRCS Field Office, Cooperative Extension Service 
office, state natural resource, or state agriculture 
department regarding its status and use. 
 
 
 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
Weed information is also available from the PLANTS 
Web site at http://plants.usda.gov.  Please consult the 
Related Web Sites on the Plant Profile for this species for 
further information. 
Description and Adaptation 
Creeping burhead is a creeping annual or short-lived 
perennial.  The leaves are broadly heart shaped, 2-7 
inches long and almost as wide.  The principal veins are 
conspicuous and impressed on the upper surface of the 
leaf blade.  The petioles are 4-20 inches long, enlarged 
and spongy towards the base.  The flowering shoot 
(scape) can reach 3 feet or more in length. scapes are 
upright when young, often drooping and rooting at the 
tips to produce new plantlets.  Numerous whorls of 
flowers with white petals and greenish centers are located 
along the scape. Flowering begins in June and continues 
until frost. The fruiting heads are round, bur like clusters 
of small brown seeds.  The native range of the species is 
from Maryland south to Florida, west to Missouri and the 
panhandle of Texas.  It is usually found growing in 
swamps, wet woodlands, marshes, and ditches. There are 
some indications that it prefers a slightly shaded location.  
Best growth is generally on wetland soils with fairly high 
organic matter.

Establishment 
Leflore Source creeping burhead, a selection of this 
species, is established using transplants. The creeping 
nature of this plant produces numerous small plantlets that 
can be dug and divided from the parent plant.

Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
Leflore Source creeping burhead was originally collected 
in the Mississippi Delta and was released as source 
identified material in 1996 by the Natural Resources 
Conservation Service (NRCS), the Mississippi 
Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station (MAFES), 
and the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries at 
Mississippi State University.

Larger plants can also be dug and should be planted 
without further division. Cutting the leaves before 
planting is usually not necessary unless they are unusually 
tall, however, cutting any attached flower scapes is 
recommended.  The plants can be planted year round, but 
spring and fall planting will be less stressful.    
Recommended plant spacing is 2-3 feet.  After planting, 
water levels should be kept at about 1-2 inches until the 
plants become established.  A light application of 
complete fertilizer may be applied to aid establishment.  
Management 
Established plants will tolerate water depths up to one 
foot during the growing season, with greater depths 
acceptable when the plants are dormant. If the growing 
site is infertile, the plants will respond to two or three 
light applications of complete fertilizer during the 
growing season.  Burning or mowing is not 
recommended.   
Pests and Potential Problems 
Occasional late-summer leaf dieback has been observed.  
Environmental Concerns 
Further work is needed to determine creeping burhead’s 
adaptation in wetlands subject to sewage effluent. 
Control 
Please contact your local agricultural extension specialist 
or county weed specialist to learn what works best in your 
area and how to use it safely.  Always read label and 
safety instructions for each control method.  Trade names 
and control measures appear in this document only to 
provide specific information.  USDA NRCS does not 
guarantee or warranty the products and control methods

It has been used to soothe gastrointestinal troubles in 
man and horses.  Early pioneers were quick to pick 
up on healing properties of this species, probably 
from contact with Native Americans as they traveled 
west, across the plains.   
 
Modern medicine has also seen potential benefits 
associate with this plant species.  Studies have shown 
eastern purple coneflower to be an immune system 
booster.  It has also shown activity against bacterial 
and viral infections.  Chemical compounds extracted 
from Echinacea have even shown inhibitory effects 
against certain forms of cancer. 
 
Echinacea is a very popular herbal remedy today, and 
can be found easily in heath food stores.  It is most 
commonly used to treat the common cold and flu.  
However, some scientists debate its effectiveness for 
such use.  It should be noted that herbal remedies can 
interfere with some prescription medication.  Allergic 
reactions have occurred in some individuals.  It is 
recommended that a healthcare professional be 
consulted before use of such products.   
 
Landscaping:  Eastern purple coneflower is a popular 
plant in home gardens and is often grown for its 
showy flowers.  It can be used in pots, as accents in 
flower beds, or as borders.  It can also be used in 
wildflower mixes for roadside beautification and 
prairie restoration. 
 
Wildlife:  Eastern purple coneflower will attract 
insects and butterflies when in bloom, and song birds, 
particularly Goldfinches, are fond of its seed in the 
fall.

Asteraceae Family.  Eastern purple coneflower is an 
erect, long lived, perennial herb that grows one to 
three feet in height, and produces a woody rhizome.  
It has a very distinctive flower with reddish-purple 
petals.  The petals may be pink or white in some rare 
instances.  There is a characteristic “cone” at the 
center of the flower, from which its name is derived.  
Echinacea is rooted in the Greek word for hedge hog, 
echinos, in reference to the spiky appearance of the 
cone.  The stems are rough and have small hairs 
along their entire length.  The leaves are alternate,

Eastern purple coneflower can be found throughout 
most of the eastern and central United States.  It can 
be found as far west as Colorado and north to 
Wisconsin, Michigan, and New York.  It is not

increasingly rare as its range extends westward, past 
Missouri. 
 
This plant prefers full sun, and has a low tolerance of 
drought conditions.  It will grow in a wide range of 
soil textures, and prefers a pH between 6.5 and 7.2.

reportedly not necessary. however, most sources note 
that it does improve germination.  Cold stratification 
can be achieved by storing the seed in moist 
conditions in a cooler or refrigerator for 2 months, or 
by planting in the fall. 
 
If a solid stand of plants is desired, broadcast seeding 
at a rate of 12-15 pounds of seed per acre should be 
used.  For 36 inch rows, a seeding rate of 3 to 5 
pounds per acre will be adequate.  In wildflower 
mixes up to 1 pound of seed per acre may be used.   
 
For home applications seed may be germinated in 
flats, and transplanted into pots or flower gardens.  
Mature plants may also be divided when dormant and 
transplanted.  This process is done by splitting the 
dormant crowns into smaller units, and transplanting 
to desired locations.  The rhizomes and roots are very

Livestock: Canada wildrye provides good forage 
quality during the early part of the grazing season but 
is generally considered an inferior forage after it 
matures.  It is fairly palatable to most livestock, and 
is rated good in energy value but poor in protein

Wildlife: Canada wildrye has fair to good palatability 
as food for wildlife.  It also provides nesting, brood, 
winter, and escape cover.  
Erosion Control: Exceptional seedling vigor and 
rapid establishment make Canada wildrye an 
excellent species for use in erosion control seedings.  
Stands of Canada wildrye typically establish during 
the 1st year, reach peak production the 2nd or 3rd year,

Bottlebrush squirreltail field at UCEPC Meeker, Colorado. 
 
Alternate Names  
Squirreltail, tall squirreltail, desert squirreltail 
 
Uses 
The  potential  uses  of  bottlebrush  squirreltail  include 
erosion control and domestic livestock and wildlife forage 
production. The plant establishes easily, remains green for 
a  long  period  and  is  palatable  throughout  the  winter. 
Squirreltail has become an important tool for oil shale and 
coal  mine  reclamation.  It  has  also  become  an  important 
source for reseeding after fire. It is quick to establish, has 
a proficient seed dispersal mechanism, and is resistant to 
fire damage. Bottlebrush squirreltail has also shown that it 
can  become  a  good  competitor  with  undesirable  annual 
weed  species.  Bottlebrush  squirreltail  is  recognized  as 
being  one  native  perennial  bunchgrass  that  has  potential 
for  broad-scale  application  in  range  seedings  where 
introduced  products  such  as  crested  and  Siberian 
wheatgrasses  and  Russian  wildryes  have  been  used 
traditionally.  Excellent  seed  dispersal,  ability  to  tolerate 
fire,  and  strong  seedling  vigor  make  bottlebrush 
squirreltail  an  attractive  species  for  use 
in  many 
conservation applications.

Description and Adaptation 
 
Bottlebrush squirreltail distribution from USDA-NRCS PLANTS 
Database. 
 
For updated distribution, please consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
 
Bottlebrush  squirreltail,  Elymus  elymoides,  is  a  cool-
season native perennial bunchgrass. The plant grows 8-25 
inches tall, and occurs primarily on dry, gravelly or saline 
soils  and  is  common  on  hillsides  and  alkaline  flats.  The 
stiff, involute leaf blades expand up to 3/16 of an inch in 
width and often become smooth or softly pubescent. The 
spikelets  are 
flowered  at  each  node  of  a 
disarticulating  rachis.  The  spikelets  drop  from  the  seed 
head and are disseminated by the  wind  into  surrounding 
areas.  
 
Bottlebrush  squirreltail  is  widely  distributed,  spanning 
from Mexico to British Columbia and from the west coast 
to the Dakotas and south to Oklahoma and Texas. It also 
occupies a wide range of elevations from 4,000 to 10,500 
feet.  As  a  species,  Elymus  elymoides  has  good  drought

resistance  and 
It 
establishes  easily  and  creates  a  good  environment  for 
succession. Bottlebrush  squirreltail is also quite resistant 
to  fire.  The  seedheads  of  squirreltail  have  low  densities 
and  burn  quickly  at  relatively  low  temperatures  when 
compared  to  other  perennial  bunchgrasses.  Bottlebrush 
squirreltail  is  valuable  winter  forage  for  many  domestic 
and wildlife species because of its long green period. 
 
Establishment 
For  best  results,  bottlebrush  squirreltail  seed  should  be 
planted to a depth of ¼ to ½ inch  into a  firm  weed-free 
seedbed.  For  pure  stands  the  recommended  drill  seeding 
rate  is  7  lb  PLS  per  acre.  Seed  can  be  planted  in  early 
spring, but late dormant fall seeding is recommended for 
best  annual  weed  suppression.    Squirreltail  does  not 
establish  well  into  existing  perennial  shrub  communities 
without pre-mechanical treatment to reduce shrub density. 
 
Management 
Plants that green  up early  will remain green through the 
fall  and  into  winter.  Stands  should  be  protected  from 
heavy grazing by livestock and wildlife, especially during 
flowering.  Protection  ensures  sufficient  seed  production 
to  maintain  the  stand.  Wildland  seed  collection  occurs 
from  early  July  to  mid  September.  Seed  yields  can  vary 
widely  depending  on  stand  age  and  density.  Because 
bottlebrush  squirreltail  seed  is  dispersed  quite  easily  by 
wind,  open  fallow  fields  may  be  subject  to  bottlebrush 
squirreltail invasion. 
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Plants are known to be susceptible to rust disease. 
 
Environmental Concerns 
Bottlebrush  squirreltail  can  pose  aggressive  behavior 
because of easy seed dispersal. Some routine management 
may be required to control and maintain this plant species 
in  an  agronomic,  horticultural  or  home  landscaping 
application,  but  control  practices  are  financially  feasible 
and practical.  No specific  management is anticipated in 
range  or  large  landscape  plantings  where  the  species 
naturally occurs. 
 
Control 
Please contact your local agricultural extension specialist 
or county weed specialist to learn what works best in your 
area and how to use it safely.  Always read label and 
safety instructions for each control method.

wetland environments. Stems are upright and round 
and are typically 10 to 70 cm (4 to 27 in) tall. Stems 
are topped with a terminal spikelet bearing numerous 
flowers. The fruit is a yellow to brown lenticular 
achene from 1.5 to 2.5 mm long. Achenes are tipped 
with a tubercle and subtended by up to 8 bristles. 
 
Creeping spikerush is a native obligate wetland 
species found throughout the Northern Hemisphere. 
It occurs in all U.S. states except Georgia, Florida 
and Hawaii. 
 
Creeping spikerush grows on sites that are either 
permanently or seasonally flooded. The plants can 
grow and thrive in permanent water up to 1 m (3 ft) 
deep. They can also survive in areas where the water 
table drops to 30 cm (12 in) below the surface late in 
the growing season. Plants are commonly found 
growing in areas totally inundated for up to 4 months.  
Plants grow in saturated, fine textured soils in neutral 
to alkaline or saline conditions (pH 7 to 8 and EC 
&lt.14).

has moderate to good tolerance of alkaline conditions 
(pH = 8.8).  Salinity tolerance ranges from 1 to 16 
mmhos/cm depending on environmental conditions 
and ecotype.  It is surpassed in this trait only by tall 
wheatgrass. 
 
It is less drought tolerant than either crested or 
western wheatgrass and may succumb to drought 
since it sometimes matures late in the season.  It does 
not tolerate excessive soil moisture.  It is shade 
tolerant. 
 
Considerable genetic variability is present in slender 
wheatgrass populations and some ecotypes may be 
rather specific to their original sites due to self-
pollination. 
 
Slender wheatgrass is distributed throughout the 
northeast, north, and west portions of the United 
States.  For a current distribution map, please consult

Texas Plant Material Center in Nacogdoches, Texas 
is also evaluating this species for collections adapted 
to the northern and eastern portions of Texas and the

For South and South Central Texas, plantings should 
be done in the early fall on a clean, firm, weed-free 
seedbed, with adequate soil moisture. Planting depth 
will vary according to the soil type of the planting 
location.  An emergence study conducted by the Kika 
de la Garza PMC (1998) found that seeds should be 
planted from ¼ - ½” deep on clay soil type, and up to 
1” deep for sandier soils. 
Virignia wildrye can be drilled at a minimum of ten 
pounds of pure live seed per acre, or broadcast at 
twenty pounds of pure live seed per acre.  If it is a 
critical area planting or if dense coverage is desired, 
double the seeding rate.   When including Virginia 
wildrye in a seed mixture, adjust the seeding rate 
accordingly.  The planting should be considered 
successful if 1-2 plants are present per square foot 
planted.  Stands are best established and maintained 
if they are not planted next to areas with a large 
concentration of aggressive warm-season grasses, 
such as K-R Bluestem or Buffelgrass. 
Virginia wildrye is also a good seed producer.  It can 
produce as much as 400 pounds of seed per dryland

bunchgrasses common to the northern Great Plains 
and the Intermountain regions of the western United 
States.  They are long-lived cool season native grass 
with an extensive root system with strong tillers.  
Bluebunch and Snake River wheatgrasses spread by 
seed, except in high rainfall zones where some short 
rhizomes may occur. 
Bluebunch wheatgrass is highly variable and grows 
to 1.5 to 4 feet tall and seed spikes are 3 to 8 inches 
long.  The auricles (ear-shaped appendages where 
leaf blade and sheath meet) are pointed and semi-
clasping to nearly lacking.  Leaves are lax, flat to 
inrolled, 4-6 mm wide and green to blue in color.  
Leaf sheaths are generally smooth and hairless.  
Reproductive stems are erect, slender, sometimes 
wiry with a wavy floral stalk.  Seeds have a bristle or 
awn.

Cutleaf daisy 
Uses  
Livestock:  Engelmann’s daisy is rarely found on 
overgrazed pastures due to its palatability by livestock.  
Cattle, sheep, and goats can all benefit from the high 
protein and digestibility obtained from this species.  
Crude protein can reach as high as twenty-five percent in 
early spring.  Livestock, like wildlife, can benefit from 
grazing on Engelmann’s daisy before warm-season 
varieties become available.  
  
Wildlife:  This species benefits wildlife in several ways.  
Deer and rabbits enjoy feeding on Engelmann’s daisy.  It 
has high protein content and is available earlier in the year 
than warm season vegetation.  Engelmann’s daisy also 
provides cover for small mammals and many species of 
birds.    
  
Erosion Control:  Engelmann’s daisy is commonly 
planted on slopes like roadsides and embankments to help 
reduce the potential of soil erosion.   
 
Plant Fact Sheet
Status  
Please consult the PLANTS Web site 
(http://plants.usda.gov) and your State Department of 
Natural Resources for this plant’s current status (e.g. 
threatened or endangered species, state noxious status, 
and wetland indicator values).  
  
Weediness   
This plant may become weedy or invasive in some 
regions or habitats and may displace desirable vegetation 
if not properly managed.  Please consult with your local 
NRCS Field Office, Cooperative Extension Service 
office, state natural resource, or state agriculture 
department regarding its status and use.  Weed 
information is also available from the PLANTS Web site. 
please consult the related web sites on the Plant Profile 
for this species for further information.  
  
Description   
Engelmann’s daisy is a native, cool-season perennial 
which can grow up to three feet tall.  The plant produces a 
basal rosette of leaves that can grow eight inches long.  
Leaves are very deeply cleft or almost divided.  Coarse 
hair can been found on both the leaves and stems of the 
plant.  The vegetation remains green throughout the 
winter, and begins to flower in May.  The flower head 
elongates during the spring months.  Engelmann’s daisy 
flower heads are made up of yellow ray and disk flowers.  
They measure about one to two inches in diameter.  
During extreme heat, the petals of the plant fold 
downward.  
  
Adaptation  
Engelmann’s daisy is adapted to a wide range of soil 
types and climate conditions, but is found most frequently 
throughout central Texas.  Ideal soil types range from 
sandy loams to clay loams.  Engelmann’s daisy does not 
seem to tolerate heavy clay soils, salinity, or deep sands.  
The plant has a deep tap root which makes it a hardy, 
drought tolerate species.  
  
Distribution  
Engelmann’s daisy is most commonly found throughout 
north central Texas and the Edward’s Plateau.  It is also 
found as far north as South Dakota, as far west as 
Arizona, and as far east as Louisiana.  For a current 
distribution map, please consult the Plant Profile page for 
this species on the PLANTS Website. 
 
Establishment  
Planting should be done in late summer or in the fall.   
Sow seed ¼ to ¾ inch deep in a well prepared, firm 
seedbed.  The full seeding rate for Engelmann’s daisy is 
 
 
 



Page 2
fifteen pounds of pure live seed (pls) per acre.  When 
planting this as a component of a seed mixture, the 
seeding rate should be adjusted to the desired percent of 
the mix.  Ideal plant spacing would be two to three plants 
per square yard.  Fertilizer applications will vary 
depending on individual soil samples.  Nitrogen, 
potassium, and phosphorus should be considered to bring 
the fertility up to a medium level.  Twenty pounds of a 
mixture of these three fertilizers will normally provide 
this level of fertility. however, a soil sample should 
always be taken before applying fertilizer.    
  
Management  
Engelmann’s  daisy  is  rarely  planted  as  a  monoculture 
planting but as a component of a range seeding mixture.  
Twelve  months  of  grazing  deferment  should  be  planned 
and  applied  to  allow  plant  establishment.    Areas  with 
heavy  deer  populations  should  consider  the  impact  and 
added maintenance associated with attempting to establish 
this species.    
  
Proper management of Engelmann’s daisy is required to 
ensure  the  plant  is  not  overgrazed  or  over  utilized  by 
livestock  or  wildlife.    Consult  your  local  NRCS  Field 
Office 
for  assistance  with  planning  and  applying 
prescribed grazing.  
  
Control   
Please contact your local agricultural extension specialist 
or county weed specialist to learn what works best in your 
area and how to use it safely.  Always read label and 
safety instructions for each control method.  Trade names

a rate of 3 to 5 pounds per acre, or 1 to 2 pounds per 
acre in mixtures with other species.  Seeds will 
germinate quickly and plant growth is rapid.  The 
seed is extremely fine, requiring mechanical seeding 
equipment to have small seed attachments.  If seeded 
with a ‘hand’ cyclone seeder, the lovegrass seed 
should be mixed with a diluent or a carrier (cornmeal, 
sand, or fine sawdust) for uniform distribution of 
seed.  Do not cover seed more than 1/2 to 1 inch on 
sandy soils. 1/4 inch is sufficient on silt loams.  
Cultipacking soil before seeding is helpful. 
Sites too steep or stony for use of mechanical 
equipment can be seeded without soil scarification.  
Broadcast seeding by air or use of hydroseeders is 
successful if seeding rates are increased to 
compensate for poor seedbed. Where possible, the 
soil should be scarified and firmed. 
Normally, weeping lovegrass can be planted after 
danger of severe frost is over, and anytime 
throughout the summer with success.  Lime and 
fertilizer needs are similar to that for tall fescue and 
ryegrass when used for temporary cover.

Contributed by: NRCS Plant Materials Center, Pullman, 
WA 
Eriophyllum lanatum.  Ben Legler, University of 
Washington Burke Herbarium 
 
Alternative Names 
Common Alternate Names: Oregon sunshine, golden 
yarrow, yarrow leaved eriophyllum, dwarf woolly 
sunflower, Pursh’s woolyleaf 
 
Scientific Alternate Names: None 
Uses 
Pollinator habitat: Eriophyllum lanatam attracts beetles, 
syrphid flies, bees, moths and butterflies.  Butterflies that 
are known to visit this plant include:  orange sulfur, red 
admiral, comma, and skipper.  It also serves as a host 
plant for the painted lady butterfly.  An endangered 
 
butterfly in Oregon, Fender’s Blue (Icaricia icarioides 
fenderi) relies on E. lanatum for a source of nectar. 
 
Ornamental: This plant is hardy to Zone 3 and can be 
used in perennial borders, along pathways, and in rock 
gardens and embankments. The Lady Bird Wildflower 
Center recommends selecting a local ecotype, planting 
several plants in a group, and pruning the dead branches. 
 
Rangeland vegetation: This plant is quick to establish and 
can be used for revegetation and diversification of 
rangeland in a variety of habitats.    
 
Ethnobotanical: People of the Miwok tribe made a 
poultice of the leaves of this plant and bound them to 
aching parts of the body. the Skagit rubbed the leaves on 
skin to prevent chapping. and the Chehalis used the dried 
flowers as a love charm. 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
Description and Adaptation 
Sunflower family (Asteraceae).  Eriophyllum lanatum is a 
native forb or subshrub, and may be an annual, biennial, 
or short- or long-lived perennial depending on site 
conditions.  It has a multi-branched, erect to spreading 
form and grows to 10 to 60 cm (4 to 24 in) tall.  Stems 
and leaves are covered with white hairs.  Leaves are 2.5 to 
7.5 cm (1 to 3 in) long and irregularly divided into narrow 
lobes.  Flowers are solitary, on long stems and bloom 
May through July.  The flower head is 4 to 6.5 cm (1.5 to 
2.5 in) wide with golden yellow disk flowers and 8 to 12 
yellow ray flowers, each 1.5 to 2 cm (0.6 to 0.8 in) long.  
Flower bracts are broad and erect.  Seed is narrow, 
smooth, has four angles and a crown of scales or short 
pappus.   
 
Common woolly sunflower is adapted to areas with dry, 
rocky or sandy soil which receive a minimum of 25 cm 
(10 in) annual precipitation at elevations from sea level to 
3,050 m (10,000ft).  The plant has a high drought 
tolerance due to its white hairs that conserve water by 
reflecting heat and reducing air movement across the leaf 
surfaces.  It often grows in rocky areas along roadsides, 
on coulees, bluffs, and canyons, and in dry grassland, 
thickets and forests. 
 
This plant is common on both sides of the Cascade 
Mountains from British Columbia south to Washington,

Oregon and California.  Its range extends east to Nevada, 
Idaho, northwestern Utah, western Wyoming, and western 
Montana.   
 
 
Common woolly sunflower distribution from USDA-NRCS PLANTS 
Database. 
For updated distribution, please consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
Establishment 
Plants can be established by seed or seedlings.  Seeds 
should be drilled into a weed-free seed bed in the fall at a 
rate of 3.4 kg PLS per ha (3 lbs PLS per acre) and at a 
depth of 0.6 cm (0.25 in).  When planted in a mix, the 
seeding rate should be adjusted according to the 
proportion of the mix.  The seed requires a cold and moist 
period of about 90 days for optimal germination. 
 
To transplant seedlings, the seed should be planted in 
containers in October or November, stratified in cold and 
moist conditions for a period of 90 days, and moved 
inside to a greenhouse.  The plants should be hardened off 
in a cold frame for 2 to 4 weeks prior to transplanting to a 
prepared field site.  Plants should be spaced 15 to 45 cm 
(6 to 18 in) apart.   
Management 
Eriophyllum lanatum is a prolific seed producer and will 
rapidly spread to any surrounding open ground.  If plant 
spread is not desired, flower heads should be removed 
prior to seed ripening.

able to establish on severe sites.  
  
Ethnobotanical: Native Americans used rubber 
rabbitbrush for baskets, yellow dye, chewing gum, tea, 
cough syrup, and to treat chest pains.  During World War 
II the plant was studied as a substitute for commercial 
rubber, and currently it is a small commercial rubber 
source.  
  
Ornamental: Rubber rabbitbrush is a desirable plant for 
low maintenance and sustainable landscaping.    
  
Status  
Consult the PLANTS Web site and your State Department 
of Natural Resources for this plant’s current status (e.g., 
threatened or endangered species, state noxious status, 
and wetland indicator values).  
  
Description and Adaptation  
General: Composite family (Asteraceae).  Rubber 
rabbitbrush is a native, perennial, warm-season shrub that 
grows to 1 to 8 feet tall.  It has a rounded crown with 
stems originating from its base.  Stems and leaves are 
covered with dense white hairs.  Leaves are 0.75 to 2.75 
inches long, 0.02 to 0.12 inches wide, alternate, linear to 
spatula shaped with entire margins.  Flowers are yellow, 
tubular, 0.25 to 0.4 inch long, arranged in terminal, 
rounded clusters.  Flowers begin bloom late July – 
October.  Inflorescences and seed bracts often persist 
through winter.  Seeds are achenes with pappus and are 
wind disseminated.  Reproduction is primarily by seeds 
and epicormic buds.    
  
The species is taxonomically complex, and is divided into 
two subspecies and 22 varieties (ecotypes).  The 22 
ecotypes exhibit a great deal of variability in 
morphological characteristics and chemical composition.  
  
Distribution: Ericameria naseosa is present in New York 
and all Great Plains and western states in the United 
States, and in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, 
Saskatchewan, and British Columbia. For current 
distribution, please consult the Plant Profile page for this 
species on the PLANTS Web site.

Rubber rabbitbrush distribution from USDA-NRCS PLANTS Database.  
 
Habitat:  Rubber rabbitbrush inhabits dry, open areas on 
plains, valley bottoms, foothills and mountains.  It is 
associated with many habitat types (Tirmenstein 1999).    
  
Establishment  
Rubber rabbitbrush can be established by transplanting 
seedlings, or drilling or broadcasting seed.  Planting can 
be done in spring or fall, on prepared or unprepared 
seedbeds (Tirmenstein 1999).  Rubber rabbitbrush should 
be seeded in a mixture with forbs and grasses at a rate of 
0.025 lb Pure Live Seed (PLS) per acre.  This rate should 
be doubled if the seed is broadcast.  
  
Management  
To control invasive weeds while minimizing damage to 
rubber rabbitbrush, an application of chlosulfuron can be 
effective (Enloe et al. 2009).    
  
Environmental Concerns  
Although rubber rabbitbrush may appear to dominate a 
plant community soon after disturbance, it is not overly 
competitive (McArthur 1979) and is eventually replaced 
with other vegetation as the community matures.

Description and Adaptation 
General: Buckwheat family (Polygonaceae).  Clay-loving 
wild buckwheat is a long-lived low-growing, spreading 
sub-shrub, reaching up to 4 inches (10 centimeters) in 
height and 12 in (30 cm) across.  “Stems are spreading 
without persistent leaf bases up to 1/3 the height of the 
plant. aerial flowering stems spreading to erect, slender, 
leaves, 1 per node” .  Leaves are dark green and appear 
needle-like with in-rolled margins.  Flowers are white to 
cream with reddish-brown midribs and brownish-red 
bases, (Figure 2), petals all the same length.  Fruits are 
achenes, light brown, 0.1 in (0.3 to 0.35 cm) and 
triangular in cross-section. Flowering occurs late May to 
early September.

Alternative Names 
N/A 
Uses 
Pollinators: Clay-loving wild buckwheat flowers are 
visited by more than 50 species of pollinators in a season.  
Roughly half of these 50 species are native bees, and 18 
species are native ants .  The USFWS and others have 
noted, that of all Eriogonum species studied to date, none 
has as many pollinators as clay-loving wild buckwheat. 
Status 
Clay-loving wild buckwheat was designated as 
endangered, with critical habitat, by the USFWS in 1984. 
 
The NatureServe conservation status rank an international 
effort which rank species on their “global” status, denotes 
clay-loving wild buckwheat as G2/S2- globally imperiled 
and statewide imperiled, with a high risk of extinction due 
to very restricted range, very few populations (often 20 or 
fewer), steep declines, or other factors. 
 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
 
Clay-loving buckwheat distribution from USDA-NRCS PLANTS 
Database. 
 
Distribution:  Clay-loving wild buckwheat is endemic to 
the rolling clay (adobe) hills and flats immediately 
adjacent to the communities of Delta and Montrose, of 
west-central Colorado.   
 
Habitat:   The habitat of clay-loving wild buckwheat 
consists of adobe clay badland hills and flats within the 
sparsely vegetated desert shrub community.  This plant 
community includes the following clay-loving buckwheat 
plant associates:  mat saltbush (Atriplex corrugata), black 
sagebrush (Artemesia nova), shadscale (Atriplex 
confertifolia), Gardner’s saltbush, (Atriplex gardneri), 
bud sagebrush (Picrothamnus desertorum), charming 
woodyaster, (Xylorhiza venusta), and Adobe Hills

Adaptation  
Clay-loving wild buckwheat is adapted to the harsh 
growing conditions that include clay, alkaline, and 
calcareous soils of the Mancos shale formation, unique to 
west-central Colorado.  The Mancos shale formation has 
been associated with high salts and selenium, however no 
selenium accumulation information related to clay-loving 
wild buckwheat is known at this time.  At elevations 
ranging from 5,180 to 6,350 ft., clay-loving wild 
buckwheat is generally found growing on the mid to 
lower slopes of the rolling topography of the adobe 
Mancos shale hills, also occurring in swales or drainages.   
With an average annual total precipitation of 7-10 inches, 
clay-loving wild buckwheat is dependent upon the 
microclimates created by the small areas where snow 
lingers longer due to aspect, topography, and landscape 
position. 
For updated distribution, please consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
Establishment 
Clay-loving wild buckwheat requires an insect pollinator 
in order to set seed, for both outcrossing and self-
pollination (within a plant but not within a flower).  
O’Kane in 1985 stated that “seed dispersal is usually 
passive, either being consumed or carried by animals, 
windblown, or moved by gravity or water.”  “All 
Eriogonum species studied thus far have seeds that 
require a cold period to break dormancy (not necessarily a 
freeze), and some Eriogonum species have seeds with a 5-
year shelf life.” 
 
Management 
Clay-loving wild buckwheat occurrences and suitable 
habitat continue to be threatened by growing development 
pressure and related expansion activities around the 
communities where it occurs.  Additionally, 75% of the 
occupied habitat occurs on private lands.  In Colorado, 
endangered plant species are not afforded protection 
unless a Federal nexus exists, such as canal development 
projects.  Conservation efforts geared toward private 
lands would greatly benefit this species to prevent further 
isolation of the small existing populations most at risk 
from habitat fragmentation, thereby reducing the 
resiliency of these populations.   
 
According to the Colorado Natural Areas Program  life 
history study of clay-loving wild buckwheat, it appears 
that this species grows at highest densities away from 
 
 
 
 
other shrubs, such as black sagebrush (Artemisia nova).  
Other research in which individuals of clay-loving wild 
buckwheat were permanently tagged from 1990 to 2008 
supports the conclusion that this species is relatively long-
lived (20-30years minimum). 
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Tent caterpillar impacts have been noted on clay-loving 
buckwheat.  
 
Environmental Concerns 
The effects of climate change could pose continued 
uncertainty to the long term survival of clay-loving wild 
buckwheat populations.  Due to the limited range of the 
Mancos shale formation and the long-lived nature of this 
species, its ability to migrate with changing climates is 
uncertain.  Decreased or lack of flowering has been noted 
in association with the 1998 drought in the region, thereby 
causing concern that a lack of precipitation, during the 
growing and flowering season, could significantly impact 
seedling recruitment.

Texas cupgrass survives only under moderate grazing 
pressure.  It will persist in overgrazed pastures only 
under the protection of shrubs.  Texas cupgrass is an 
indicator of good range condition. It is seldom a key 
management species, however, because it rarely 
dominates a site.  
Texas cupgrass has several problems from a seed 
production standpoint.  First of all, some of the taller 
plants tend to lodge, which makes harvesting seed a 
problem.  Second, seed retention is poor.  Seed 
shatter tends to occur fairly rapidly after the seed has 
ripened making it difficult to harvest a stand because 
all the heads do not ripen at once. Third, there 
appears to be an ongoing problem with spittlebugs on 
the seed heads, which decreases the quantity of viable 
seed.  Finally, Texas cupgrass appears to be 
susceptible to smut on the seed heads, a problem that 
can also affect seed quality.

Pollinators: Sulphur-flower buckwheat attracts a wide 
variety of bees and other native pollinators.  It is a larval 
host and nectar source for lupine blue butterfly (Plebejus 
lupini).  The cythera metalmark butterfly (Apodemia 
mormo cythera) and the Rocky Mountain dotted-blue

few varieties of sulphur-flower.  Bees produce a strong, 
dark honey from the nectar. 
Restoration: Sulphur-flower buckwheat can be included 
in seed mixes for restoration of native plant communities 
 
on dry, rocky slopes and other sites where the species is 
adapted. 
Landscaping: Sulphur-flower buckwheat can be used for 
environmental enhancement, erosion control and 
foundation plantings around homes.  Plants withstand sun, 
heat, drought, and wind, making them ideal for dry sunny 
slopes.  The showy flowers and seed heads, and compact 
growth habit make this plant a good choice for rock

Ethnobotany: Tribes throughout western North America 
traditionally used different parts of the sulphur-flower 
buckwheat plant to treat a variety of ailments.  The 
Klamath used a poultice of the leaves to soothe burns.  
The Cheyenne made a tea from powdered stems and 
flowers that was used as a gynecological aid for lengthy 
menses.  The Paiute and Shoshone made a poultice of 
mashed leaves, and sometimes roots, to treat lameness or 
rheumatism, and took a hot decoction of roots for colds or 
stomachaches.  The Kayenta Navajo used the plant as a

Sulphur-flower buckwheat is a native, low-growing, 
woody perennial in the buckwheat family (Polygonaceae).  
The plant typically forms low, broad mats with individual 
clumps ranging from 4 inches to 2 ft (but up to 4 ft) tall 
and wide.  Leaves are basal, 1 inch long, and softly wooly 
or hairless.  Flower stems are 3 to 16 inches tall and 
topped by umbel-shaped clusters of tiny flowers.  Flowers 
range from sulfur yellow to orange or reddish, sometimes 
turning rusty orange-red with age.  Floral displays can 
color entire slopes starting in June at lower elevations and 
continue into September or October at higher elevations. 
Sulphur-flower buckwheat is usually found in dry, open, 
rocky sites with shallow, sandy soils, especially on sunny 
slopes and ridges.  This species typically grows in regions 
that receive from 8 to 18 inches annual precipitation, 
which may come in the form of winter rain/snow or 
summer monsoons.  This plant grows best in full sun on 
well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils with low fertility, but 
will sometimes tolerate saturated soils and light shade.  It 
has high drought, salinity and carbonate tolerance, and 
grows in soils ranging from a pH of 6.5 to 9.0.

established by direct seeding or transplanting plugs or 
container stock.  Select a sunny, well-drained planting site 
and maintain good weed control, especially of annual 
grasses, during the first year of establishment.  The 
recommended single-species broadcast seeding rate is 8 to 
10 pounds per acre, but the rate should be adjusted 
depending on the species mix and site conditions.  There 
are 100,000 to 200,000 seeds per pound, so a seeding rate 
of one pound per acre will result in about 2 to 5 seeds per 
square foot.  Seeds should be raked in to a depth of about 
¼ inch.  Seeds are dormant, and usually require 8 to 12 
weeks (but as many as 24 weeks) of cold, moist 
stratification in order to germinate, depending on the 
elevation and climate of the original collection.  
Dormancy is broken naturally by fall sowing if locally-
adapted germplasm is used.  Alternately, seeds can be 
cold stratified by placing them in a fine mesh bag buried 
in moist peat moss or sand in a ventilated container at 34 
to 37°F and planted out in the early spring.   
For seed production prepare a weed-free, smooth, firm, 
level seedbed for planting.  At the Corvallis Plant 
Materials Center, fields are direct sown in the fall at a 
depth of ¼ inch and a rate of 10–12 pounds per acre (50 
seeds per square foot) in rows 18–24 inches apart, unless

seed until their second growing season and do not reach 
full production until year three, but can remain productive 
for ten to twenty years.   
Seeds are mature when the petals and sepals become dry

control, ecosystem restoration, and wildlife food and 
cover. Kawelu is one of the dominant species on 
Laysan and Lisianski islands and Pearl and Hermes 
Atoll where it is widely used by seabirds for nesting 
and foraging. On Laysan, the endemic and 
endangered Laysan Finch nests almost exclusively in 
kawelu and eats the seeds. Kawelu also provides 
important breeding habitat for the endangered Laysan 
Duck and several species of indigenous seabirds and 
terrestrial arthropods. On Pearl and Hermes Atoll, 
kawelu provides cover for noio (brown noddy), 
wedge-tailed shearwaters, and koa’e’ula (red-tailed 
tropic bird). 
 
Cultural: The native Hawaiians used kawelu for 
thatching their houses as an alternative to piligrass 
(Heteropogon contortus). It is used to enhance 
cultural sites. Kawelu is referred to in poems, songs, 
and hula chants. Kawelu is a hula step that signifies 
the waving of grass. 
 
Ornamental: Kawelu is an attractive bunchgrass that 
can be used as an accent plant and for other 
landscape uses. Individual plants look like small, 
light green fountains. This is especially true for the 
type from the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.

grass. The stems or culms are erect, smooth, and 1 to 
3 or more feet tall. There is considerable variation in 
length of leaves and flowering panicles. The leaf 
blades are flat at the base and rolled inward at the 
upper part. Leaves are 0.50 to 0.60 inch wide and up 
to 32 inches long.  The flowering heads or panicles 
are narrow and range from 8 to 16 inches long. They 
are either somewhat open or dense and spike-like, 
with branches strongly upright to spreading. The oval 
seeds (caryopsis) are .03 to .06 inch long with minute 
grooves. They are dark reddish brown. There are 
approximately 3,136,000 seeds per pound. 
 
Kawelu is an endemic that occurs in the Hawaiian 
Islands on sand dunes, grasslands, open sites in dry 
forests, and exposed slopes and ridges or cliffs from 
sea level to approximately 3,700 feet. It is found in 
the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands on the atolls of 
Kure, Midway, and Pearl and Hermes and the islands 
of Lisianski, Laysan, and Nihoa. It occurs naturally 
on the main islands of Hawaii, Kauai, Lanai, Maui, 
Molokai, and Oahu. It is grows naturally in areas that 
receive approximately 40 to 100 inches of rainfall 
annually. It can be established in lower rainfall areas, 
but may not perpetuate itself. 
 
There is a distinct difference in growth habit between 
plants from the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and 
those found on the main islands.  Kawelu plants from 
the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands are more upright

the stem are much shorter, but they may be as wide 
as the basal leaves.  All the leaves are thick and 
parallel veined and have soft or weak prickles spaced 
far apart along the edges.  The leaf bases clasp the 
single, erect stem.  Flower heads are on stout 
peduncles at the tip of the stem.  Each nearly 
spherical flower head is from 1/2 to 1 inch in 
diameter and is made up of many small flowers.  
Whitish bracts stick out sharply from the flowers, 
which gives the flower head a rough, prickly feel and 
appearance.  The heads have a honey-like odor and 
are in bloom June to September.  Individual fruits, 
which mature in the flower head, are less than 1/10 
inch long.  The root of rattlesnake master has been 
used medicinally by American Indians and pioneers.

Scientific Alternate Names: 
Solidago graminifolia (L.) Salisb. 
Solidago lanceolata L.

Uses 
Wildlife Use:Flat-top goldentop provides a nectar source 
for pollinators and is well-suited for use in pollinator 
restoration. Preliminary observation found that flat-top 
goldentop attracted 13 different species of Hymenoptera 
and Lepidoptera in Cape May, New Jersey. The European 
honey bee (Apis mellifera),common buckeye (Junonia 
coenia), and eastern carpenter bee (Xylocopa virginica) 
were most frequently observed visiting the flower. 
 
The wildlife value of this species is considered low. 
nevertheless, songbirds such as the American goldfinch 
(Carduelis tristis) and the swamp sparrow (Melospiza 
georgiana) feed on the seeds (Hilty, 2002). Deer and 
rabbit enjoy browsing the plant. 
 
The flower attracts the goldenrod soldier beetle 
(Chauliognathus pensylvanicus) and black blister beetle 
(Epicauta pensylvanica). The goldenrod soldier beetle 
larvae are beneficial insects known to feed on aphids,

maggots, caterpillars, and grasshopper eggs. while the 
adults help to pollinate plants (Trigg, 2005). Black blister 
beetles produce cantharidin, a poisonous substance that 
may poison animals that graze the plant (Marlin, n.d.). 
Please refer to Hilty (2002b) for a complete list of  insects 
that visit this plant. 
 
Status  
E. graminifolia is a native, facultative wetland plant that 
usually occurs in wetlands (67–99%) but is occasionally 
found in non-wetlands. Please consult the PLANTS Web 
site and your State Department of Natural Resources for 
this plant’s current status (e.g., threatened or endangered 
species, state noxious status, and wetland indicator 
values) 
 
Weediness 
This plant may become weedy or invasive in some 
regions or habitats and may displace desirable vegetation 
if not properly managed. Please consult with your local 
NRCS Field Office, Cooperative Extension Service 
office, state natural resource, or state agriculture 
department regarding its status and use. Weed information 
is also available from the PLANTS Web site at 
http://plants.usda.gov. Please consult the Related Web 
Sites on the Plant Profile for this species for further 
information. 
Description and Adaptation 
Description: Flat-top goldentop is an upright, erect, native 
perennial with a many-branched inflorescence. It is an 
herb of the Asteraceae family whose species name means 
“grass-leaf”. It grows to 3–6 ft in height with a 1–2 ft 
spread. The upper ½ of the plant appears bushy due to its 
branched stems and grass-like, narrow to linear, alternate 
leaves. It grows from a long-slender rhizome. 
The stalk-less 2–4 in long leaves taper to a long point, and 
narrow towards the stem. The leaf has 3–5 nerves 
underneath and is minutely rough-pubescent along nerves 
and margins. There are a few resinous dots on the 
underside of the leaf. The lower leaves are deciduous 
early in plant’s life cycle and the upper leaves are reduced 
towards the inflorescence. The leaves omit a scent when 
crushed.  
The primary stalk supporting the flower cluster is winged 
and pubescent with hairs lying flat on the wing margins. 
The flower heads are 2–2.5 in high, are arranged in dense, 
stalk-less, small flat-topped clusters of 20–35 flowers 
with s mall rays. It has pale to bright yellow flowers that 
bloom in the late summer or early fall. The outer flowers 
of the cluster open first. The flower heads are cone-
shaped and attached at the pointed end. The whorl of

small leaves beneath the flower is ovoid to bell-shaped. 
The obtuse or rounded, yellow bracts around the flower 
are somewhat sticky. These overlapping bracts are 3.1 
mm long and occasionally have green tips. The .02 in (.5 
mm) long seed is a hard, pubescent, one-seeded, 
indehiscent white nutlet. The seed is attached to hair-like 
bristles (pappus). The receptacle is finely fringed. 
 
E. graminifolia var. graminifolia is distinguished by its 
relatively narrow leaves that are 11–20 times as long as 
wide (Gleason and Cronquist, 1963). E. graminifolia var. 
hirtipes is the hybrid of E. graminifolia and E. 
caroliniana (Fernald, 1950), and is distinguished by its 
relatively broad, hairy leaf blades and few-flowered head. 
 
 
Flat-top goldentop distribution from USDA-NRCS PLANTS Database. 
 
Adaptation: Flat-top goldentop can be found in moist, 
open ground. meadows. prairies. roadsides. ditches. inter-
dunal flats. exposed lakes. conifer swamps. lowland 
forests. calcareous seeps. and sandy moist shorelines. It is 
tolerant of poor, gravelly, sandy, or dry soils and once 
established, can tolerate droughty conditions. It is also 
found in shaded wood edges or sunny fields and clearings. 
For updated distribution, please consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
 
Es tablishment 
Seed can be sown year-round in a greenhouse that is at 
least 65°F. The recommended planting is three seeds per 2 
in plug, watered regularly. It can also be sown outdoors 
from seed in the fall or sow the seed in a coldframe. E. 
graminifolia is a prolific rhizomatous perennial that 
spreads aggressively through vegetative reproduction. 
When growing from vegetative material divide rootball 
(rhizomatous clumps) while plant is dormant. Cuttings 
should be kept in the greenhouse at least 3 months to 
allow for ample root and shoot development. When 
transplanted into field, plant on 1.5–2 ft centers.  
Unwanted seed dispersal from wind can be prevented by 
the development of a vegetative curtain or buffer with 
native shrubs, vines, or understory trees.  
Management 
Adding nitrogen will increase plant size, including an 
increase of stem height, number of leaves, and stem 
diameter. E. graminifolia seems to have a delayed 
response to nitrogen, and may store access N over winter 
in its rhizomes. Adding N has been shown to increase the 
density of stems in the second year after fertilization, 
thereby eliminating other plant species and reducing 
community diversity. 
Pests and Potential Problems  
Allelopathic chemical properties have been found in root 
and leaf extracts of flat-top goldentop and may interfere 
with the growth of other species. Leaf leachates tend to 
interfere with seed germination while root leachates 
negatively affect the root growth of competing plants. 
Crops such as radish and lettuce are susceptible to 
allelopathic competition and should not be grown in the 
same area. Maples have also been negatively affected by 
similar Solidago species. 
 
Environmental Concerns 
Due to rhizomatous growth, E. graminifolia is somewhat 
aggressive. This plant may become a noxious weed so is 
perhaps not a good choice for more formal gardens unless 
controlled with a complimentary buffer planting. It is not 
as aggressive as S. Canadensis or S. rugosa. E. 
graminifolia is considered invasive in Europe. 
Control 
Please contact your local agricultural extension specialist 
or county weed specialist to learn what works best in your 
area and how to use it safely. Always read label and 
safety instructions for each control method.

Spotted Joe-Pye Weed is a native perennial 
wildflower that grows from 2 - 6 feet tall.  The 
central stem is hairy and purple or purple-spotted, as 
are the flowering stalks.  Fragrant purple flowers, in 
flat-topped clusters of 9 or more florets per head, 
appear in mid- to late summer (July-September).  The 
florets produce wind-dispersed small dry seed with 
hair-like bristles.  Plants are mostly unbranched, 
except for flower-bearing stalks near the apex of the 
plant.  The ovate (egg-shaped) leaves have 
conspicuous veins, grow up to 8 inches long and 2.5 
inches across, and usually appear in whorls of 4 or 5.  
The fibrous root system sometimes produces 
rhizomes (horizontal stem with shoots above and 
roots below), which create colonies. 
 
Distribution: Spotted Joe-Pye Weed prefers moist 
conditions and populates a variety of wetland habitats 
from Nova Scotia south to the mountains of North 
Carolina and from Nebraska to British Columbia 
(USDA cold hardiness zones 2-9).  It is rarely found 
on disturbed sites.

Common name: Penland Alpine fen mustard, 
Mosquito range mustard. 
 
Uses 
Many mustard family plant species have known food 
value (cabbage, broccoli, kohlrabi, kale, etc.), in fact, 
Wasabi, Eutrema japonica, is a commonly recognized 
member of the Eutrema genus in Asia.   
 
Penland’s eutrema is browsed by alpine wildlife.   
 
 
  Plant Fact Sheet
Status 
Penland’s eutrema was designated as endangered by the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) in 1993. 
 
The NatureServe conservation status rank, an 
international effort which ranks species on their “global” 
status, ranks Penland’s eutrema as G1/S1- critically 
imperiled globally and in Colorado.  
 
Penland’s eutrema is only one of two species of Eutrema 
in North America and the only one in the lower 48 states. 
 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
Description and Adaptation 
General:  Mustard family (Brassicaceae).  Penland’s 
eutrema is a diminutive herbaceous perennial plant that 
grows from a taproot .  Plants grow up to 6 inches (15 cm) 
in height with one to several spreading erect stems 
(Figure 1).  Basal leaves are heart-shaped with rounded 
tips.  Several white, four-petalled flowers top each stem.  
The leaves and fruit are without hairs (glabrous) and 
stalked which distinguishes this species from many other 
small types of mustard that grow in the area such as 
Draba (whitlow-grass). Flowering occurs June to August 
and even into September, depending on the site and snow 
melt.  Fruits of Penland’s eutrema are the characteristic 
mustard family siliques. they are diamond-shaped in 
cross-section and turn purple-black when mature which 
also distinguishes the plant from other look-alikes.

Distribution:  Eutrema penlandii is a narrow endemic 
known only to occur in the Mosquito mountain range of 
Colorado in Lake, Park, and Summit counties.  Range-
wide distribution reaches 18 miles from north to south 
and approximately 10 miles east to west, encompassing 
roughly 200 acres of occupied habitat.  This species is 
thought to be an ice-age relic with its closest relative, E. 
edwardsii, found in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. 
Approximately 40% of the existing known populations 
and habitat for Penland’s Eutrema occurs on private land.  
Please consult the USFWS website at www.fws.gov, for 
more information. For current distribution, please consult 
the Plant Profile page for this species on the PLANTS 
Web site.  
 
Habitat: Penland’s eutrema is an alpine tundra species 
that grows above treeline in association with many 
species of moss, forbs, and graminoids in alpine meadow 
habitat.  It occurs in wetlands with perennial water flow 
from snowmelt, at 11,800 -13,100 ft. in elevation.  
Penland’s eutrema generally grows on the leeward, south 
and east-facing, flat to gently sloping benches with steep 
walls that provide some protection from snow-melting 
winds.  The annual precipitation is 30-40 inches.  
Penland’s eutrema is known to frequently occur in 
association with a variety of alpine tundra species 
including: white marsh marigold (Caltha leptosepala), 
water sedge (Carex aquatilis), mountain sedge (Carex 
scopulorum), Bering chickweed (Cerastium 
beeringianum), alpine spring beauty (Claytonia 
megarhiza), tufted hairgrass (Deschampsia cespitosa), 
Ross avens (Geum rossii), elephanthead (Pedicularis 
groenlandica), arctic bluegrass (Poa arctica), America 
bistort (Polygonum bistortoides), alpine bistort 
(Polygonum viviparum), King’s crown (Rhodiola 
integrifolia), Rose crown (Rhodiola rhodantha), 
diamondleaf saxifrage (Saxifraga rhomboidea), and 
alpine meadow rue (Thalictrum alpinum).  The Mosquito 
Range includes thirteen other rare plant species, of which, 
two are known only from the range. 
 
Adaptation  
Penland’s eutrema is adapted to grow in the Mosquito 
Range in central Colorado, where a unique set of habitat 
conditions exist. An arctic circumpolar species, Penland’s 
eutrema is separated from its closest relative E. edwardsii, 
which occurs in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago by over 
1000 miles to the north.   
For updated distribution, please consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
Establishment 
Depending on snow-melt, Penland’s eutrema produces 
mature fruits from late-July into August and into 
September. Penland’s eutrema produces from seed with 
no means of vegetative reproduction.  Little else is known 
 
about the reproduction, pollinators, or seed dispersal at 
this time. 
Management 
Primary threats to Penland’s eutrema appear to be from 
habitat loss through recreation (off-highway vehicle use, 
camping, and hiking), alterations to hydrology, mining 
impacts, and climate.   
Pests and Potential Problems 
Currently there are no known pests affecting the growth 
and vigor of Penland’s eutrema.  Associated threats may 
include the introduction of non-native invasive plant 
species from hikers and campers as recreational use 
numbers continue to increase annually of this popular 
recreation area that constitutes the only habitat of 
Penland’s eutrema.  Impacts of herbivory from pikas and 
rodents have been noted by researchers.  However, 
Penland’s mustard has evolved some tolerance to grazing 
and wildlife usage. For instance, a taproot growth form 
enables re-sprouting after grazing.  Interestingly, to date, 
the main non-native constituent in Penland’s mustard 
habitat is dandelion, Taraxacon officinales, another tap-
rooted species. 
Environmental Concerns 
Hydrology is the most fragile aspect of the habitat 
affecting Penland’s eutrema.  Any activity that directly or 
indirectly alters the surface or ground water supply and 
alters the wetland habitat required by this species could 
pose a significant threat. On a larger scale, climate change 
could potentially threaten this and other alpine species 
since there are no upward elevation to which the species 
may migrate.

Common Boneset is a native perennial wildflower 
that grows from 2 - 4 feet tall.  The central stem is 
covered in long white hairs and is unbranched with 
the exception of a few flowering side stems near the 
apex of the plant.  The narrow, lanceolate (tapering), 
opposite leaves grow up to 8 inches long and 2 inches 
across.  The bases of the leaves tend to grow 
together, making it appear as if the central stem 
perforates the leaves.  Two- to eight-inch clusters of 
fragrant white flowers (with approximately 15 florets 
per flower head) appear in late summer or early fall.  
The florets produce wind-dispersed small dry seed 
with hair-like bristles.  The fibrous root system 
frequently produces rhizomes (horizontal stem with 
shoots above and roots below), which create small 
colonies. 
 
Distribution: Common Boneset prefers moist or wet 
conditions, soil with a significant amount of organic 
matter, and full to partial sun.  It populates a variety 
of wetland habitats across eastern North America 
from Quebec south to Florida and west to Texas and 
Manitoba (USDA cold hardiness zones 2 - 10).

daylight.  Colder temperatures have been known to 
reduce germination, whereas higher temperatures 
tend to reduce the survival of new seedlings.  
However, Texas kidneywood has been known to 
germinate with no light and temperatures from 59-
104 ºF. 
Kidneywood seeds can be planted hulled, or in the 
pod.  Fresh untreated seeds can be planted, and we 
have had success in germinating hulled seeds that 
have been stored in a seed cooler for as long as 25 
years (see our PMC s Technical Note # 6, 1999).  Dr. 
Richard Hoverson recommended to PMC staff in a 
1993 personal communication that if planting 
seedpods, they should be pre-soaked in distilled 
water for 72 hours prior to planting, with the water 
being changed every 8 hours.  
Seeds should be planted ¼-½ inch deep in a well-
drained planting medium.  A shallower planting 
depth of 1/8 inch is recommended for heavier, clay

tend to root in 3 to 4 weeks.   
We recommend that young plants be 6-9 inches in

Alternate Names 
Depending on the taxonomic authority, other names 
include Festuca rubra ssp. arenicola, Festuca rubra ssp. 
densiuscula, and Festuca rubra ssp. pruinosa or rock 
fescue. Classification remains under review.  
Uses 
Sand fescue spreads by short rhizomes (underground 
stems) and develops extensive roots giving it excellent 
soil and sand binding capability for erosion control along 
beaches and streambanks, and on other disturbed slopes.  
Additional uses include forage for cattle and horses, 
endemic wildlife food and cover, and restoration of 
coastal meadows and other native plant communities.  
The species is also planted for low maintenance turf and 
ornamental landscaping.  It has potential as perennial 
cover in vineyards, young orchards, and no-mow lawns.  
 
   
 
 
 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
Status 
Sand fescue occurs equally in wetlands and drier uplands. 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
Description and Adaptation 
Sand fescue is a dense, fine textured, medium to long 
lived, perennial cool season grass. It spreads slowly from 
rhizomes and seed.  Foliage is primarily basal and 
typically green, with some individuals or populations 
turning blue-grey in summer.  Stems (culms) grow to a 
height of 8-24 inches (20-60 cm) and the flower head 
(panicle or inflorescence) is branched but often 
compressed rather than open.  Most populations flower in 
May or June, maturing seed a month later.  Sand fescue is 
part of a diverse complex of red fescue species that have 
transitional forms and introduced germplasm.  They 
intergrade from one to another making separation and 
identification difficult and somewhat disputed. 
 
The prototypical native sand fescue is found on beaches, 
rock crevices, meadows, gravelly sites, and streambanks 
in full sun to partial shade primarily along the Pacific 
Coast.  It occurs only at lower elevations on moist to 
moderately dry soils from California to Washington. The 
natural range may extend further north into coastal British 
Columbia but not inland.  The species tolerates many soil 
types besides sands, including silty clay loams with low 
fertility.  Coastal types have presumed tolerance to salt 
spray and preference for moderately acidic to neutral, 
well- to moderately well-drained soils. Drought tolerance 
may exceed that of other closely related red fescues.

For updated distribution, please consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
Establishment 
Sand fescue seed germinates readily, indicating dormancy 
is low or nonexistent in most populations.  Fall sowing is 
preferred to reduce the need for irrigation the following 
spring and summer.  Establishment is slow and plants 
seldom flower the first full growing season.  Where weed 
competition is expected to be high, fertilization should be 
postponed for the first six months or more. There are 
365,000 to 500,000 seeds/lb.  A 1 lb/ac pure live seed 
(PLS) rate results in 8-12 live seeds/sq. ft.  Suggested 
seeding rates for general revegetation are 4-10 lbs/ac 
when drilled alone at a depth of ¼ to ½ in.  If broadcast 
sown, rates are often increased 1.5 to 2 times this amount.  
For turf, a rate of 1 lb/1000 sq. ft. has been recommended.  
As with many grasses to be planted on initially poor 
quality soils, an organic mulch or compost amendment 
can benefit establishment and growth.  
Management 
In western Oregon, fall sown plants readily survive the 
wet winters and warm, dry summers and often remain 
actively growing throughout the dry season without 
supplemental water.  Under hot, dry conditions of 
California’s Central Valley, regular, deep spring and 
summer irrigation is beneficial to keep plants green, and 
may be required for survival on very droughty soils.  
Long term tolerance to high heat is yet to be determined. 
 
Until more is known, grazing management practices 
similar to those suggested for introduced creeping red 
fescue and related pasture mixtures should be used.  In a 
mowing study at Corvallis, Oregon, plants were injured 
(partial die off at the base) and the number of seed heads 
reduced in the spring following a single fall mowing at a 
height of 1 to 1 ½ in.  For turf or ground cover 
management, plants should not be mowed below a 2 ½ in. 
height. Fertilization is optional depending on goals and 
site conditions.  Sand fescue appears to perform well 
under low fertility.  Foliage can become grey-blue in 
summer. 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Sand fescue has few apparent insect problems.  
Among the most frequently observed foliar diseases 
are fungal leaf and stem rusts in the genus Puccinia.  
Occurrence of other turf and pasture diseases typical 
of red fescues is not well documented. Rodents such as 
voles, field mice, and pocket gophers can damage 
plants and stands in some years.  The species is slow to 
establish and plants may suffer early on from weed 
competition.
 
Environmental Concerns 
Sand fescue is not considered weedy within its natural 
range.  The potential exists for populations to cross with 
other native and introduced forms or species of red fescue 
creating intermediate types or hybrids.   
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
Molate red fescue, Point Molate fescue, and Molate 
fescue are unofficial names that appear in the seed trade 
and may be derived from native sand fescue growing 
along the Pacific Coast.  A natural blue form of the 
species is the cultivar ‘Molate Blue’.  It was first collected 
and developed by David Amme from a remnant coastal 
prairie population at Point Molate near San Francisco, 
California.   ‘Molate Blue’ is under Plant Variety 
Protection (PVP) and produced commercially in 
California.  The Corvallis Plant Materials Center is 
increasing seed of material derived from Coastal Oregon 
and selected for its blue color, shorter seed heads, and 
fewer visual signs of leaf and stem rusts.

California fescue is increasingly appreciated for its 
ornamental and environmental landscape value.   
 
' WHERE symbol='feca';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD fs_Description_ TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_Description_='California fescue is a native, cool 
season perennial bunchgrass that is intermediate to 
long lived.  The base is tightly clumped and the 
culms (stems) are tall and erect, growing to a height 
of 60-140 cm. Inflorescences (flowers or panicles) 
are 10-30 cm long, open and sparsely branched.  
Branches usually occur in pairs.  Leaves are medium 
textured (2-4 mm wide), primarily basal, stiff, 
sometimes purple tinged, flat or rolled, firm, and 
rough to the touch.  Plants are typically grayish blue 
to green and lack horizontal rooting systems.  This 
species flowers anytime between March and July, 
depending on elevation, population, or locale. 
 
Key to identification:  California fescue is coarser 
textured and usually taller than other native fescues, 
but might be confused with tall fescue (Schedonorus 
phoenix, synonym Festuca arundinacea), which is 
widely introduced in the region.  However, compared 
to California fescue, the leaves of tall fescue are 
wider (4-10 mm vs. 2-4 mm) and have prominent or 
clasping auricles (lobes at the base of the leaf blades).  
Parish’s fescue is smaller, but otherwise very similar 
to California fescue.  
 
' WHERE symbol='feca';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD fs_Adaptation_ TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_Adaptation_='  California fescue is found in large parts 
of Oregon and California. its range includes the 
Coast Ranges, foothills, and valleys from Clackamas 
County, Oregon, to San Luis Obispo County, 
California. The species also occurs in the Cascade 
Range from Clackamas County south into California 
and in the north and central Sierra Nevada.  Elevation 
range is from sea level to 6500 ft. in the mountains.  
Its relative, Parish’s California fescue, is confined to 
the San Bernardino Mountains of California. 
 
California fescue plants become hardy at a young age 
and, once established, are tough survivors.  Adapted 
to a variety of conditions, the species tolerates sun to 
intermediate shade and semi-drought, as well as 
moist soil along stream banks. However, it is most 
frequent in the dappled shade, along the borders of 
woods, and on north facing slopes.  Other habitats 
include oak savanna, the understory of mixed 
conifer-hardwood forests, chaparral, and serpentine 
soils (soils toxic to many plants due to high levels 
magnesium and iron silicates and other minerals).  
Preferred soils are medium to fine textured with a pH 
of 5.7 to 7.5.  In one study, the species was rated 
tolerant to salt spray and moderately tolerant to soil

minor seed dormancy, at least in some populations.  
Others report no dormancy, but two weeks of cold 
moist chilling (stratification treatment) can result in 
more uniform and quicker germination.  Spring 
 
 
sowing of untreated seed can have staggered 
germination. seedlings may emerge over a period of 
two to eight weeks. Therefore, fall planting when soil 
temperatures are cooler is highly recommended.  No 
special physical conditioning of the seed is required 
for using a drill or broadcast seeder.  While slow to 
establish, seedlings become hardy plants.  .  There are 
approximately 224,000 (+/- 20%) seeds per pound 
with hulls intact.  Each 1 pound of seed sown per 
acre is equivalent to approximately 5 seeds per 
square foot.  Sown alone, a suggested minimum 
seeding rate is 10 lbs of pure live seed (PLS) per acre 
for general revegetation.  In seed mixes, fast 
germinating and quick establishing grasses should be 
kept to a low percentage.  
 
Some practitioners prefer container plants of 
California fescue because of spotty or variable 
establishment from seed.  It is easily propagated 
vegetatively by division of the crown.  California 
fescue is presumed to have some tolerance to fire as a 
natural component of grassland ecosystems.   
Suggested frequency for prescribed fire is once every 
three to five years.  However, summer burning can be 
fatal if plants are green and active.  Specific 
guidelines for stand management and grazing are not 
well reported.

Contributed by: USDA NRCS Montana Plant Materials 
Center  
Stretchberry 
 
 
Alternate Names    
Forestiera neomexicana, New Mexico forestiera, New 
Mexico olive, New Mexico privet.  
  
Uses  
Stretchberry has several conservation applications 
including windbreaks, shelterbelts, and living snowfences.  
It can be used in wildlife plantings for nesting, cover, and 
food.  Although the species performs best when provided 
with adequate soil moisture, it is considered fairly drought 
tolerant and can be used in Xeriscapes® and for mine land 
reclamation.  
  
Status  
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values).  
  
Description and Adaptation  
Stretchberry is a multi-stemmed, perennial shrub reaching 
a mature height of 12 to 15 feet under ideal conditions 
(high soil moisture, good nutrition).  It has numerous, 
sometimes interlocking branches, and is capable of 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
sprouting from the base.  The light-green to grayish-green 
oblong simple leaves have an opposite arrangement on the 
stem.  New bark is smooth and light gray to brown. old 
bark tends to be smooth and light gray.  The yellow 
flowers are inconspicuous and borne in dense clusters in 
the axils of the previous year’s leaves.  Stretchberry 
blooms in late March or early to mid-April before new 
leaves appear.    
  
Stretchberry fruit is a round to oblong drupe (berry) that 
matures to a dark bluish-black to black color from June to 
September.  Fruit retention tends to be moderate, the fruit 
often lost to birds before falling to the ground.  
Stretchberry is comparable to skunkbush sumac Rhus 
trilobata in function and use.  It tends to form dense, 
almost impenetrable hedges, although the branches of 
stretchberry are more linear, erect, and supple than 
skunkbush sumac.  
  
Stretchberry is native to southwestern United States.  It 
grows along stream courses, moist valleys, hillsides, and 
mesas at elevations of 3,000 to 7,000 feet.  It is well 
adapted to annual precipitation zones ranging from 
approximately 9 to 24 inches.  It grows best in soils with a 
pH range of 7.0 to 8.5.  It is described as needing a 
minimum of 160 frost-free days, although it grows well in 
Montana in areas characterized by a 135-day growing 
season.  
  
Distribution:  Stretchberry is found in Arizona, 
California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, 
Texas and Utah.  Please consult the Plant Profile page for 
this species on the PLANTS Web site.  
  
Establishment  
Stretchberry establishes from seed, containerized, or 
bareroot stock.  Plant seeds in moist soil in the fall or 
prior to February for natural stratification.  Seedlings 
emerge by May.  For spring planting in May, seeds must 
be stratified for 30 days in moist sand at 38 degrees 
Fahrenheit.  Thin seedling to two-foot spacing within 
rows.    
  
Management  
Although stretchberry is considered drought tolerant, its 
performance is improved with supplemental watering and 
fertility.  As with other woody plants, it is important to 
control weeds during establishment with tillage, weed 
cloth, or careful application of herbicides.  
   
Pests and Potential Problems  
No serious insect or disease problems have been 
observed.

preferred habitat and the primary use of the species.  
Black ash is a small to medium sized tree with 
opposite branching and compound leaves.  Leaflets 
number 7-11 (typically more than green ash) and are 
green and smooth on both sides.  The terminal leaflet 
has a short stalk, but the other leaflets are attached 
directly to the leaf stalk (petiole).  The fruit is a 
samara with a broader wing than that of green ash.  
The bark is pale gray and flaky, and the crushed 
foliage smells like elderberry.  The first key to 
identifying black ash is its location on poorly drained 
sites.  It is slower growing (1.5-2.5 ft/yr) than 
associated trees such as red maple.

Contributed by: USDA NRCS Bridger Plant Materials 
Center, Bridger, Montana 
 
Gaillardia aristata, Susan R. Winslow, Bridger PMC 
Alternate Names 
Indian blanketflower, common gaillardia, gaillardia 
Uses 
Blanketflower is a native perennial wildflower useful for 
adding species diversity in native plant seed mixes for 
rehabilitation of disturbed sites. It can be used in 
producing native wildflower sod for restoration of native 
plant colonies. Blanketflower is suitable for use as an 
ornamental wildflower in low maintenance or naturalistic 
landscapes. It has utility as a cover and food source for 
pollinators, wildlife, and livestock. 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
Description and Adaptation 
Blanketflower is a native, perennial, tap-rooted 
wildflower with showy, yellow ray flowers and reddish-
brown central disk flowers. The pubescent plants vary 
from 10 to 24 inches in height. Leaves are arranged 
alternately along the stem and are 3 to 6 inches long with 
margins that are coarsely-toothed and deeply divided. 
Blanketflower grows on sunny, well-drained sites in 
 
 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
prairie meadows up to grassy openings in the mountains. 
It has an extensive bloom period beginning in early 
summer. 
It does well on a variety of soil types, including loams to 
rocky to gravelly-sandy textures. and tolerates a soil pH 
range from slightly acidic to mildly alkaline. 
Blanketflower attains optimum growth in full sun, 
beginning in early spring until seed set in late summer. It 
occurs at elevations from 1,300 to 9,000 ft. 
 
 
 
Blanketflower distribution from USDA-NRCS PLANTS Database 
For updated distribution, please consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
Establishment 
Blanketflower may be grown from seed or division of 
vegetative parts. The seed does not require cold 
stratification treatment to break dormancy. For range 
plantings, seed should be planted into a firm, weed-free 
seedbed, preferably with a mechanical drill that will 
ensure uniform seed placement depth of ¼- to ½-inch. 
There are approximately 220,700 seeds in one pound of 
blanketflower. The full seeding rate is 5 pounds pure live 
seed/acre, but it would seldom be seeded in a pure stand. 
It is recommended that blanketflower be included as a 
component of a native seed mixture at a rate not to exceed 
½ to 1 pound pure live seed/acre. When used in a mix, 
adjust the seeding rate to the desired percentage of mix. 
Spring seeding is preferred over late summer or dormant, 
fall planting dates. 
Seed production fields should be established in rows at 25 
pure live seeds per lineal foot of row. Between-row 
spacing is dependent on the type of planting and 


Page 2
 
cultivation equipment, and ranges from 24 to 36 inches. 
Adequate between-row space should be provided to 
perform mechanical cultivation. At 24-inch row spacing, 
the recommended seeding rate is 2.5 pounds pure live 
seed/acre, and at 30- and 36-inch row spacing, the seeding 
rate is 2.2 and 1.9 pounds pure live seed/acre, 
respectively. There are presently no herbicides 
specifically labeled to control weeds in seed production 
fields of this species. Seed harvest can be accomplished 
by direct combining when the seeds have just begun to 
shatter from the radiate flower head. Immediately after 
combining, spread out harvested material to dry and 
prevent mold. Due to the persistent hairy pappus, and 
poor seed flow, this species is fairly difficult to clean. 
Seeds are moderately viable and longevity can be 
expected for several years when stored at favorable 
temperatures and low humidity. Meriwether Germplasm 
blanketflower yielded approximately 150 bulk pounds of 
seed per acre in experimental irrigated plots at the Bridger 
Plant Materials Center (BPMC) on an average harvest 
date of July 29. Seed production is expected to be much 
higher when grown under conventional agronomic 
conditions. 
conditions. Periodic mowing during the establishment 
year is one option for weed suppression. 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Blanketflower has no serious insect or disease problems. 
Root rot may be a problem in poorly drained soils, 
especially during extended periods of heavy rain. 
Powdery mildew may be present at times of elevated 
humidity, but usually does not have a long-term negative 
impact on the plants. The species generally is susceptible 
to aster yellows and fungal leaf spot disease. Gaillardia is 
slightly susceptible to oat blue dwarf virus. 
Environmental Concerns 
Blanketflower plants tend to be moderately long-lived and 
may re-seed in abundance. A skin rash or irritation may 
develop following contact with juice or sap from the 
foliage. 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
Meriwether Germplasm Selected Class blanketflower was 
released in 2011 by the BPMC in cooperation with the 
agricultural experiment stations of Montana State 
University and the University of Wyoming. Meriwether 
Germplasm is a composite of seed collections from 14 
Montana counties and one county in Wyoming.

Blanketflower seed may be planted directly in containers 
without pre-treatment for greenhouse production. Seeds 
dry stored for three months or more do not require a cold 
stratification to overcome dormancy. However, a brief 
period of a cold, moist stratification improves germination 
uniformity. In a 10 in3 cone-tainer, a tight root mass is 
expected to develop in approximately four months. 
Containerized material should be transplanted after the 
last killing frost in the spring in advance of hot, dry 
weather, and no later than 30 to 45 days before the first 
killing frost in the fall of the year.

Palatability of G. striata is rated good to very good 
for cattle and horses which consume both flower 
stems and leaves.  It is rated fair to good for sheep 
which tend to use only the leaves.  The seed is food 
for waterfowl and birds while the foliage and tall 
stems provide good wildlife cover.  Foliage is 
seasonally grazed at a light to heavy rate by deer, 
muskrat, and bears.  Elk can make minor use of it as 
well.  Tall mannagrass may be applicable to seeding 
mixtures targeted to improve species richness and 
exclude reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea) 
prior to its invasion.  It is occasionally planted as an 
ornamental in and around backyard ponds.

Wildlife value: Deer and pronghorn antelope 
consume licorice foliage. Birds and small rodents eat 
the seed of licorice, while pocket gophers consume 
their roots. 
 
Erosion control: It has a deep root system extending 
some 12 feet into the prairie soil. It is recognized for 
its soil binding capabilities and it has wide ecological 
amplitude. Licorice has extensive rhizome production 
and it exhibited vigorous growth on mine spoil sites 
in North Dakota. 
 
Ethnobotanical: American licorice was widely used 
as medicine by the Indians of the Great Plains. The 
Cheyenne’s drank medicinal tea made from the 
peeled, dry roots of the plant for diarrhea and upset 
stomach. The Lakota’s used the root as a medicine 
for flu. The Dakota’s steeped the licorice leaves in 
boiling water to make a topical medicine for earache. 
The roots were also chewed and held in the mouth to 
relieve toothache. The Blackfeet made a tea from the 
root to relieve coughs, chest pain, and sore throat.

This plant belongs to the legume family (Fabaceae). 
Glycyrrhiza is a Greek word that means “sweet root”. 
The species name, lepidota, means “scaly” and refers 
to the minute scales on young leaves. American 
licorice is a native, perennial legume common to 
disturbed areas, draws, woods, and depressions over 
much of temperate North America. The plant 
reproduces by seed and underground stems called 
rhizomes. Licorice has an erect growth habit and is 
1.5 to 3 feet tall. Its stems are smooth and branched. 
The leaves are smooth, alternately attached to the 
stem, and have many (7 to 21) leaflets that are 
arranged opposite each other along the leaf stem.  
The flowers are on short stalks and crowded on 
terminal spikes. Its flowers are yellowish-white and 
shaped similar to alfalfa flowers. Flowers bloom June 
to August and seed matures from July to October. 
The seed pods are brown, leathery and ½ to 1 inch 
long. The pods are covered with many stout, hooked, 
brown spines which form a burr. This hooked pod 
assists the plant in dispersal since they stick to animal 
fur and are moved to new growing sites. The Dakota

Western mannagrass is a short-lived, cool season 
perennial grass with flaccid stems (culms) that reach 
a height of 70 to 150 cm.  The form is moderately 
coarse textured, clumpy, and upright to nearly flat: 
spreading from rhizomes or decumbent (low lying) 
stems that root at the nodes (joints).  When 
submerged in spring, this species produces floating 
stems and leaves, but flowering is reduced.   Leaf 
blades are ribbon-like, 4 to 13 mm wide, and 15 to 30 
cm long.  Flowerheads (panicles) are narrow and 15 
to 40 cm long, with appressed branches and long 
cylindrical spikelets (the groupings of individual 
florets or flowers).  The flowering period is long, 
from May to September. Western mannagrass occurs 
from British Columbia south to California and east to 
Idaho and Nevada at elevations below 4000 feet.

compared to the other two.  A botanical key, scale, 
and hand lens are needed for proper identification. 
 
Relative abundance in the wild: This species is 
widely occurring and common in the Pacific 
Northwest at low elevations, especially along streams 
and in wet meadow depressions.  Despite the long 
flowering period, seed collection is laborious because 
retention is poor: the seed drops (shatters) very easily 
when green and not fully mature. However, 
additional seed may be held within the lower leaf 
sheath and can be removed by threshing.  
 
Adaptation: This species is easy to establish and 
grow on adapted sites.  It can volunteer readily.

is food for waterfowl and birds while the foliage and tall stems 
provide good wildlife cover.  Foliage is seasonally grazed at a 
light to heavy rate by deer, muskrat, and bears.  Elk can make 
minor use of it as well.  Fowl mannagrass may be applicable 
to seeding mixtures targeted to improve species richness and 
exclude reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea) prior to its 
invasion.  It is occasionally planted as an ornamental in and 
around backyard ponds. 
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current status 
(e.g. threatened or endangered species, state noxious status, 
and wetland indicator values). 
 
Description and Adaptation 
In the Pacific Northwest, fowl mannagrass is a long-lived, 
cool season perennial bunchgrass with somewhat succulent 
stems (culms) that reach a height of 100 to 180 cm.  The form 
is erect, robust, and clumpy despite the production of slow 
growing rhizomes or underground stems.  Rate of spread may 
vary among populations.  Leaf blades are soft, ribbon-like, 6 
to 12 mm wide and 15 to 25 cm long.  The flowerhead 
(panicle) is loose, broad, pyramid-like, and 8 to 27 cm long 
with spreading and drooping branches.   Populations 
previously described for G. striata include plants that are 
shorter and tougher with smaller leaves (2 to 5 mm wide) and 
flower heads that are more closed.  G. striata occurs across 
most of North America.

Uses 
Fowl mannagrass is a rapidly establishing native species 
suitable for restoration of swamps, the edges of marshes, 
ponds, and streams, and other wetland plant communities 
where an herbaceous understory is desired.   It has versatility 
for use along creeks and ditch bottoms where exposure may 
vary from full sun to dense shade, thereby improving soil 
stability beyond the use of woody plants alone.  Where this 
species dominates, herbage production is high.  Palatability of 
G. striata is rated good to very good for cattle and horses 
which consume both flower stems and leaves.  It is rated fair 
to good for sheep which tend to use only the leaves.  The seed

Key to identification: Fowl mannagrass can be easily confused

is about 37 live seeds per square foot.  Seeding rates depend 
on methods used, objectives, and site conditions. 
 
Management 
Sites where fowl mannagrass occurs are typically too wet for 
grazing when the herbage is most succulent. Therefore, access 
must be deferred until late in the season when soils are drier 
and quality has declined somewhat. Tolerance to fire and 
heavy grazing is not well documented.   Fowl mannagrass can 
be grown for seed on upland sites with medium to fine 
textured soils if regular irrigation is applied in summer and 
fall. 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Glyceria striata is susceptible to fungal pathogens such as 
Epichloe glyceriae, which causes floral castration, and 
Ustilago striiformis, better known as stripe smut.  Fungicides 
may be needed for control.  Consult with your local Extension 
Service agent, plant disease control handbook, or other experts 
for advice.   
 
Environmental Concerns 
Some strains or populations of G. striata may contain 
cynogenetic compounds.  Cyanide poisoning has been 
reported in cattle from both fowl and reed mannagrass, so 
caution is advised for livestock utilization. Other species of 
mannagrass are described as weedy in certain crops or wet 
areas, but concerns for fowl mannagrass are not widely 
known. 
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area of 
origin) 
Seed sources and plants are regularly available throughout 
much of the United States.

Relative abundance in the wild: Seed ripens in July or August 
and retention within the flower head is fair to good.  
Collections can be readily made along wet forest road ditches, 
but access can be difficult along streams or in denser, swampy 
brush where this species is commonly found. 
  
Adaptation: Fowl mannagrass occurs widely in bogs, seeps, 
wet woods, thickets or swampy areas, shaded ditches, and 
along or in streams.  It may occasionally be found growing in 
full sun on summer damp soils as well as in standing water.  
Reportedly, this species is best adapted to freshwater, semi-
aquatic habitats (G. elata) or those that are irregularly to 
seasonally flooded and saturated for up to 25% of the growing 
season (G. striata).  However, some plants have been 
observed to thrive and flower under continuous inundation (1-
10 cm) for several years.  Fowl mannagrass tolerates open 
areas but prefers shady habitats.  It may occur as single plants, 
small colonies, or larger stands that dominate the understory 
of ash swales as well as willow, aspen, and other wetland 
forest or shrub communities.  Soils range from organic to 
mineral with a pH of 4 (acidic) to 8 (slightly alkaline).  This 
species does not tolerate salinity and needs moderately good 
fertility.  This species is very shade tolerant, similar to reed 
mannagrass, yet it can be grown in full sun to produce 
substantial seed.  
 
Establishment 
The presence of seed dormancy, if any, may vary among 
populations.  Seeds can germinate within two to three weeks 
without treatment, but 14 to 30 days of cold moist 
stratification (moist pre-chilling) has resulted in faster 
germination, although not necessarily higher rates.  Others 
report the need for 150 days of stratification in cold water.   
Fall sowing is preferred if dormancy is known or uncertain.  
Seed hulls readily detach but removal is unnecessary.  There 
are approximately 1,600,000 seeds per pound with hulls intact.  
A seeding rate of one pound pure live seed per acre will result

Plant Fact Sheet
 
Description and Adaptation 
Downy rattlesnake plantains are one of the many species 
of orchids native to eastern North America. They can be 
found growing in dry to moist upland woods with acidic 
soils.  The plants are low growing with stems that creep 
along the soil surface, often dividing and forming small 
colonies.  Leaves lay close to the soil in circular 
arrangement (basal rosette) around a central growing 
point.  Leaves are oval and about 1.5 to 2.5 inches long. 
Downy rattlesnake plantain has striking leaves marked 
with a network of silvery veins and a broad stripe down 
the center, resembling the skin of a snake.  All parts of the 
plant are covered with a very fine downy hair especially 
noticeable on the bloom spike.  Despite the name, downy 
rattlesnake plantain is not related to the common lawn 
weed plantains, but has similar appearing rosettes of 
leaves.  The evergreen foliage is attractive year round, 
with individual leaves lasting 3 to 4 years.  It flowers in 
late summer with small white flowers densely packed on 
a slender cylindrical spike, 6 to 18 inches tall.  Downy 
rattlesnake plantain occurs in the entire eastern half of the 
U.S. and Canada from Ontario and Quebec south to 
Oklahoma, Arkansas, Mississippi and Florida.

Database. 
For updated distribution, please consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
Establishment 
Obtain only nursery/greenhouse propagated plants from 
reputable growers, and not wild collected plants.  Orchids 
are slow to regenerate in the wild and may be easily 
eliminated through irresponsible wild collection, and may 


Page 2
be protected by law.  Downy rattlesnake plantain requires 
a site with some shade and well-drained slightly acidic 
soil with sand and organic matter such as peat or leaf 
mold.  The right soil conditions are important for survival. 
Acid soil and good drainage, especially in winter, are 
essential.  Downy rattlesnake plantain is also one of the 
few native plants that can be easily grown indoors and it 
makes an excellent terrarium plant with its attractive 
leaves.  Purchase only nursery grown plants from 
reputable nurseries.   
Management 
Downy rattlesnake plantain does well under the open 
shaded canopy of trees and taller shrubs.  Smaller shrubs 
and low growing plants should not be allowed to grow 
very close or overtop of downy rattlesnake plantain.     
Pests and Potential Problems 
There are no known problems associated with downy 
rattlesnake plantain. 
Environmental Concerns 
There are no known environmental concerns associated 
with downy rattlesnake plantain. 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
Downy rattlesnake plantain is available from commercial 
sources.  There are currently no existing cultivars of 
downy rattlesnake plantain.

Alternate Scientific Names:  Grindelia integrifolia DC. 
var. integrifolia  
Uses 
Puget Sound gumweed can be used in prairie and wetland 
restoration projects, pollinator enhancement plantings, 
hedgerows, and is a good plant for reclaiming seaside 
land.  It is also an attractive ornamental for use in 
wildflower meadows, butterfly gardens, and gardens close 
to the coast.  Several tribes in the Pacific Northwest 
extracted a resin from gumweed that was used to treat 
asthma, bronchitis, whooping cough, and dermatitis 
caused by poison ivy. 
This species is the dominant late-summer blooming plant 
in much of its native wetland prairie or salt marsh habitat, 
so it is serves as an important late-season source of pollen 
and nectar for butterflies, native bees, syrphid flies, wasps 
and other beneficial insects.  Willamette hybrid gumweed 
populations provide a critical pollen resource for an 
endemic native wetland-prairie solitary bee (Melissodes 
pullatela), and are the preferred nectar and extra-floral 
resin food source for the rare wetland great copper

butterfly (Lycaena xanthoides) in the Willamette Valley 
of Oregon.   
Status 
Puget Sound gumweed is classified as a facultative 
wetland plant, meaning it usually occurs in wetlands, but 
is occasionally found in non-wetlands.  Please consult the 
PLANTS Web site and your State Department of Natural 
Resources for this plant’s current status (e.g., threatened 
or endangered species, state noxious status, and wetland 
indicator values). 
Description and Adaptation 
Puget Sound gumweed, a member of the sunflower family 
(Asteraceae), is a native, perennial, tap-rooted, 
herbaceous to semi-woody subshrub that grows 8 to 40 
inches tall.  The stout, branched stems are leafy, upright 
or reclining on the ground but with tips ascending, and are 
generally covered in long, soft, shaggy but unmatted 
hairs.  Basal leaves are lance-shaped, slightly wider near 
the tip, with smooth or toothed edges, up to 16 inches 
long and 1½ inches wide.  Stem leaves are alternate, 
stalkless, often with clasping bases, up to 3 inches long, 
usually with smooth margins, and dotted with stalked 
glands that produce a sticky resin.  Immature flower heads 
ooze a sticky, white latex that gives them a milky 
appearance.  When open, the daisy-like flower heads are 1 
to 2 inches across and are composed of 10 to 35 yellow, 
petal-like ray flowers 1/3 to 4/5 inch long surrounding the 
yellow disk flowers in the center.  Below the flower head 
is a whorled cup of green bracts that are sticky-glandular 
with long, thin tips that are spreading or sometimes 
curved back from the flower head.  Fruits are small, wind-
borne achenes that are somewhat-flattened with a pappus 
of two to several firm but deciduous awns.  Plants flower 
from June to November.   
Grindelia integrifolia readily hybridizes with G. nana var. 
nana where the two species co-occur in the Willamette 
Valley of western Oregon.  Grindelia integrifolia x nana 
var. nana, commonly called Willamette hybrid gumweed, 
is locally common in spring-wet areas, dry pastures and 
roadsides.  Grindelia integrifolia also hybridizes with the 
coastal species G. stricta in the Puget Sound region of 
Washington.  
Puget Sound gumweed is a locally common wildflower 
found along beaches, rocky shores, wet meadows, 
wetland prairies, ditches, pastures and salt marshes.  It 
tolerates poor, sandy to clayey and saline soils, and 
prefers full sun to light shade and moist soil.  This species 
is distributed along the coast of Oregon, Washington, 
British Columbia, and the panhandle of Alaska, and 
inland in the Puget Trough of Washington through the 


Page 2
Willamette Valley of Oregon at elevations below 650 ft.  
For updated distribution, please consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
There are no developed cultivars of Puget Sound 
gumweed, but both non-certified and certified source 
identified seed is generally available from commercial 
sources.  Container plants are also sometimes available 
from native plant nurseries in the Pacific Northwest. 
Puget Sound gumweed distribution from USDA-NRCS PLANTS 
Database. 
 
Establishment 
Propagation is easiest from seed, and germination rates 
are generally high.  Seed can be sown in containers or 
directly on site in the fall or spring, and seedlings usually 
germinate in 2 to 3 weeks at 50-60°F.  The recommended 
single-species seeding rate is about 2 pounds per acre at a 
depth of ¼ to ½ inch, or about 0.25 lb/acre in a mix.  
There are approximately 128,000 seeds per pound, 
resulting in about 3 live seeds per square foot when 
seeded at a rate of one pound per acre.  Plants may also be 
propagated vegetatively by root or stem cuttings, but 
these methods are very labor-intensive and result in fairly 
low establishment rates.   
Management 
Once established, plants require little management. 
Pests and Potential Problems 
There are no known significant pests or diseases of Puget 
Sound gumweed. 
Environmental Concerns 
Established plants will readily self-sow and may spread 
into adjacent areas, so flower heads should be removed 
after blooming if spread is not desired.

tanglehead has been known to grow to heights of up 
to 5 feet tall.  There is a wide range of morphological 
and phenological variations within this species 
because of its wide range of adaptability.  The stems 
are flattened, rather tough, smooth, and a pale bluish-
green.  Leaves are produced throughout the length of 
the stem and are flat or folded, 4-12 inches long, 
about 0.25 inches wide and rough to the touch.  The 
flowering heads have narrow, crowded flower spikes 
up to 4 inches long.  The spikelets overlap and each 
fertile one bears a conspicuous red-brown awn about 
4 inches long, made crooked with two bends.  The 
long-awned seeds are sharp pointed forming tangled 
masses as they mature.  When the seeds come in 
contact with moisture, the hygroscopic awns and 
sharp barbed tips arch and twist planting them into 
the soil.  The species is mostly apomictic (producing 
seed without pollination), but sexual reproduction has 
also been known to occur.

Tanglehead can be reproduced from seeds or 
vegetative transplants.  A stand of tanglehead was 
established at the Kika de la Garza Plant Materials 
Center using vegetative bunches split off of mature 
plants.  The seeds have a dormancy period of about 6 
months.  Although seeds will germinate before this 
period, the germ-rate will be very low.   Studies 
indicate that this dormancy can be broken with 
gibberelic acid.  Plant propagules in a sterile, well 
drained medium.  Germination should occur within 
5-7 days.  One week after germination, it is 
recommended that time-release fertilizer supplements 
be added.  After 2 months, place propagules in full 
sunlight to harden off.  Propagules should be ready to 
plant within 3-4 months.

soils, although nutrient amendments according to soil 
tests would be beneficial for rapid establishment.  
 
Burning is commonly used as a tool to maintain 
tanglehead pastures for grazing in other parts of the 
world.  Grazing fields can be shredded or burned on 
an annual basis to reduce dead plant matter and 
induce new growth, but burning during the dry 
season may reduce nutrient availability.  On the other 
hand, some of the south Texas accessions were very 
sensitive to burning, being slow to re-grow.  
Therefore, ample time should be given between 
burning and grazing periods.  For rotational grazing, 
forage height should be utilized between four to ten 
inches.  It is recommended that a minimum six-inch 
stubble height be maintained under continuous 
grazing.  Tanglehead does not develop seeds if it is 
consistently grazed, but populations will decrease if 
grazing is too heavy. 
 
Tanglehead can also be harvested as hay-bales 
containing viable seed, which have been used 
extensively for the Kahoolawe Island Re-Vegetation 
Project.  Since tanglehead seed-heads have a 
tendency to bunch-up or tangle when they are mature, 
harvesting can also be done easily with the ‘PILI 
COMB’, an implement that was developed at the 
Hoolehua Plant Materials Center.  The use of 
tanglehead seed bales and seeded hay-bales for re-
 
 
vegetation of degraded native habitats requires

SMOOTH OXEYE 
Heliopsis helianthoides (L.) Sweet 
Plant Symbol = HEHE5 
Contributed by: Colorado, Kansas and Maryland Plant 
Materials Programs 
Christine Taliga, USDA NRCS Colorado Plant Materials Program 
Alternative Names 
Common Alternate Names:  Early sunflower, Smooth 
sunflower, False sunflower, Oxeye daisy, Oxeye, Oxeye 
sunflower, Heliopsis sunflower, Sunflower Heliopsis. 
 
Uses 
Forage:  Livestock and deer sometimes graze Smooth 
oxeye.   
 
Landscape:  Smooth oxeye is considered one of the best 
hardy plants for a wildflower garden border.  It performs 
well in dry (xeric) locations, in poor to average soils, and 
in full sun to partial shade.  Flowering can be extended by 
removing spent flowers.  Staking may be necessary in 
shady locations. 
 
Pollinators:  The ground nesting bee, Holcopasites 
heliopis,  is a specialist pollinator of Heliopsis 
helianthoides.  The nectar of Heliopsis attracts butterflies 
and other pollinators.  Birds utilize the seed as a food 
source, and stems provide winter cover for beneficial 
insects. 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
Description  
Heliopsis from the Greek word helios for &quot.sun&quot. and opsis 
for &quot.appearance.&quot.  Helianthoides also from the Greek 
meaning &quot.like Helianthus,&quot. the sunflower. 
Smooth oxeye is a member of the sunflower family 
(Asteraceae). It is a vigorous, upright, native, perennial 
forb growing 3’ to 4’ in height.   
 
The leaves are oppositely attached to the stem 
consistently to the top of the plant and have coarsely 
serrated margins. The toothed leaf blades are oval to 
triangular or lance-shaped. 
  
The stem is rough to the touch and may contain a single 
flower head or be branched at the apex into multiple 
stems with several yellow flowers. The flowers of 
Heliopsis have both orange-yellow center disk and yellow 
ray flowers.  Blooming occurs in summer beginning in 
July to August and extends for up to two months, making 
it one of the earliest blooming sunflowers.  Heliopsis 
forms clumps 2’ to 4’ in diameter. 
 
 
Adaptation  
Its native range is widely distributed mainly east of the 
Rocky Mountains from Ontario to Florida and 
Mississippi.  Smooth oxeye is adapted to full sunlight and 
dry to moderately moist soil conditions. It can be found 
growing in prairies, roadsides, and open woods, edge of 
fields and thickets, and waste areas.  This species tolerates 
some drought and also a wide range of soil types, 
including nutrient-poor soils.  It has proven to perform 
best in areas receiving &gt.5” of rainfall.  Smooth oxeye is 
not salinity-tolerant.

Establishment 
Seed:  Heliopsis helianthoides establishes readily from 
seed when planted in the winter/fall or early in spring 
(March to April).   Germination generally starts four 
weeks after sowing if soil temperatures remain in the 60 – 
70 degree Fahrenheit range.  Seeds ripen approximately 
one month after flowering, however as with many Asters, 
plants are self sterile. It may be necessary to crack open a 
few seeds to make sure they are viable.     
 
Cuttings and Divisions:  Five to seven node cuttings taken 
from the top 12 inches of growth in late spring root easily.  
Cuttings are sometimes reluctant to overwinter. Divide 
plants in the fall for best results. 
Management 
During the establishment period weeds should be mowed 
or spot treated with a herbicide.  Plants will produce 
viable seed the first year of establishment in mid to late 
August to September. Seeds readily shatter when mature. 
Pests and Potential Problems 
None known at this time. 
 
Environmental Concerns 
There are no environmental concerns or probability of this 
plant becoming a weed problem in cultivated agricultural 
systems or pasture lands. Rock (1981) however, indicates

ground and produce both leaves and roots at the 
nodes, which usually have a ring of hairs.  It grows 
mostly in pure stands, but sometimes grows in 
clusters from auxiliary buds on the basal nodes.  It 
does not tolerate shade.  The plant is pale green and 
not a vigorous competitor.  It grows on a wide variety 
of soils, though it grows best on loams to clay loams 
that have a pH of 6.8 to 7.4.

other species to establish, meadow barley is an 
important component of freshwater wetland, tidal 
marsh, meadow, and riparian seed mixtures for 
restoration and revegetation.  In certain trials, 
meadow barley has shown higher potential to impede 
the progress of reed canarygrass compared to several 
other native wetland grasses.  It is regarded useful as 
a temporary nurse crop for longer lived species on 
dry, infertile sites.  The species is occasionally used 
as a vineyard cover crop in California. Plants provide

to the Rocky Mountains.  It can also be found 
sporadically in other states.  Growth habit is an open 
tuft with erect to slightly spreading, smooth stalks 
(culms) that are 40 to 105 cm tall.  The flower head 
(panicle) is a narrow, flattened spike, 5 to 10 cm long 
with bristle-like awns and a brittle central axis 
(rachis) that breaks off in pieces from the top down at 
maturity.  Leaves are green to bluish green, 2 to 9

browsed by cattle, deer, elk, snowshoe hares and 
dusky-footed wood rats but not moose. As a common 
understory species, oceanspray provides cover for 
numerous birds and small mammals and also 
treefrogs. Seeds were eaten by Native Americans 
who also used the hard straight stems for arrow, spear 
and harpoon shafts, halibut hooks, digging sticks and 
sewing and knitting needles. Pioneers used the wood 
as pegs in place of nails. Medicinally, an infusion of 
dried seed was used to treat diarrhea and prevent 
contagious diseases. A poultice of oceanspray bark 
and leaves was applied to burns or sores.

BEACH HEATHER 
Hudsonia tomentosa Nutt 
Plant Symbol = HUTO 
Contributed by: USDA NRCS Cap May Plant Materials 
Center and Columbus Service Center, New Jersey  
 
Christopher F. Miller, USDA NRCS 
 
Alternate Names 
sand heather, woolly hudsonia, false heather, woolly 
beach heather 
 
Uses 
Beach heather is used in the restoration of sand dunes and 
coastal native plant communities.  It can also be used for 
developing low maintenance, salt tolerant landscapes near 
the shoreline. 
 
Status 
Beach heather is listed as either threatened or endangered 
in several states.  Please consult the PLANTS Web site 
and your State Department of Natural Resources for this 
plant’s current status (e.g. threatened or endangered 
species, state noxious status, and wetland indicator 
values). 
 
Description and Adaptation 
Beach heather is a low growing native shrub usually 3-8 
inches tall and finely branched.  Leaves are elongated and 
scale like, usually less than 0.125 inches long, and coated 
with soft, white, wooly hair. This plant has beautiful 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
yellow flowers that are 5-petaled and about 0.25 inches 
across. Blooming occurs on average from May through 
July and provides nectar for pollinator species. 
 
This plant is adapted to sand dunes, sandy pine woods, 
pine-barrens, and sand hills clearings.  Beach heather is 
much less tolerant of salt spray than the plants in the 
primary foredune (Dunegrass community) along the New 
Jersey coast.  Beach heather does not compete effectively 
with Dunegrass community plants that are growing on the 
exposed primary foredune.  Beach heather tends to grow 
in the backdune areas at an elevation of about 9 feet 
above sea level.  The backdune habitat is more protected 
from salt spray and sand movement than the primary 
foredune, but it is very dry.  Several of the plant species in 
the backdune, including beach heather, exhibit 
adaptations to dry conditions such as reduced leaf surface, 
prostrate growth, and leaf surfaces covered with hair or 
waxy covering to reduce water loss.  
 
Green sands are associated with beach heather growing in 
sand dunes in Alberta, Canada.  Green sands were 
consistently found in the buried phyllosphere and 
rhizosphere of beach heather, and on the surface to 
varying depths under the plants.   Nitrogen fixing blue-
green algae were isolated from the green sands.  Beach 
heather’s preference for an association with blue-green 
algae may relate to the ability of this dwarf shrub to grow 
on nutrient poor sand blowouts and dunes.  Also, in 
Alberta, a preliminary study showed that beach heather 
was associated with ectomycorrhizal symbionts at three 
active dune sites.  
 
Distribution: Beach heather occurs along the Atlantic 
Coast from Main to North Carolina, along the Great 
Lakes from New York to Minnesota and along Lake 
Champlain. Its range extends northwestward to Alberta, 
Canada.  For more information please consult the Plant 
Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
 
 Establishment and Management 
Beach heather establishment and management guidelines 
have not been developed at the time of this publication.  
However, pervious reports indicate that beach heather is 
short-lived and fairly difficult to grow, but can be 
propagated from seed and cuttings.  
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Beach heather has not been observed to manifest any 
notable problems with pests.  In beach habitat, beach 
heather is sensitive to trampling, mechanical disturbances 
by off-road vehicles, and over shading by woody species.

Environmental Concerns 
In various coastal locations in the mid-Atlantic, beach 
heather  has been observed to preclude other plants from 
growing in close proximity.  Coastal scientists suspect 
that beach heather is capable of producing allelopathic 
compounds to reduce competition from other species

Uses 
Wildlife Use: Common St. Johnswort provides a nectar 
source for pollinators and is well-suited for use in 
pollinator restoration habitat. Preliminary observation 
found that common St. Johnswort attracted 7 different 
species of Hymenoptera in Cape May, New Jersey. 
Brown-belted bumble bee, (Bombus griseocollis), 
common eastern bumble bee (Bombus impatiens), and 
sweat bee (Lasioglossum tegulare) were most frequently 
observed visiting the flower. Field observations suggest 
that pollinators exhibit a range of responses to this plant. 
There is not enough conclusive data to determine if the 
plant is highly preferred or less preferred among 
pollinators. 
 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
Erosion Control: 
With lateral root growth extending .4–3 in (1–8 cm) 
below the surface, and taproots extending 2–5 ft deep, St. 
Johnswort could make a good erosion control plant. 
However, the benefits of erosion control should be 
weighed against the plant’s overall aggressive, invasive 
characteristics.  
 
Status  
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g., state noxious status, and wetland indicator 
values). 
 
Weediness 
St. Johnswort is an introduced species that is considered a 
noxious weed in 7 states in the U.S. Although the plant 
invades disturbed areas it does not easily invade natural 
areas. It tends to form dense colonies that crowd-out 
native plants. Please consult with your local NRCS Field 
Office, Cooperative Extension Service office, state natural 
resource, or state agriculture department regarding its 
status and use. Weed information is also available from 
the PLANTS Web site at http://plants.usda.gov. Please 
consult the Related Web Sites on the Plant Profile for this 
species for further information. 
 
Description and Adaptation 
Description: Common St. Johnswort is an erect, multi-
stemmed, perennial forb that grows to 1–3 ft. It has long 
slender “runners” or stems growing at the soil surface or 
just below the ground. It also has aggressive rhizomes. St. 
Johnswort is part of the family Hypericaceae which 
includes trees, shrubs, and herbs with resinous sap. 
 
The numerous flowers (roughly 25–100 per stem) are 
symmetrical around a central point, determinate, in flat-
top clusters. The short-stalked flowers are about 1 in 
across, with five yellow to bright yellow-orange flowers. 
The petals are peppered with black dots around the edges.  
 
Stems are often reddish and woody at the base. There may 
be several stems (up to 30) from the base of the plant. St. 
Johnswort has a tap root and vertical roots extending to 5 
ft.  
 
The 1–2 in long, stalk-less leaves are oblong or linear, 
opposite, round-tipped, and roughly ¼ in wide. The pale 
green or yellow-green leaves have scattered translucent 
dots that make the leaf look perforated when held up to 
the light. The species name for this plant, perforatum, 
denotes this characteristic.

The sticky seed pod is a 3-sectioned capsule that turns 
deep reddish brown as it matures. The small (1 mm), 
round, darkly colored seeds have a resinous smell like 
turpentine. 
 
 
Common St. Johnswort (Hypericum perforatum) distribution from 
USDA-NRCS PLANTS Database. 
 
Adaptation: St. Johnswort is perhaps most commonly 
found in grasslands, pastures, meadows, and rangelands. 
But it also occurs in forested areas that have been 
disturbed by fire, logging, or road construction. Common 
St. Johnswort prefers well-drained, coarse-textured soils 
and does not grow well under wet conditions. St. 
Johnswort has been found to perform equally well in acid 
and calcareous soils. For updated distribution, please 
consult the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site. 
 
Es tablishment 
Common St. Johnswort is an early-flowing forb (June or 
July) that requires full sun or part shade. It can be 
propagated by seed, division, or by softwood cuttings. It 
grows well in moist, well-drained soils.  
 
First-year seedlings do not produce flowers or seeds. 
Seedlings are small and tend to grow slowly and are 
improved when inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal 
fungi. When favorable growing conditions are met, there 
may be a sudden increase in plant density and new sprouts 
will create dense mats around the base of parent plant. 
Interspecies competition will restrict seedling survival. 
Poor site quality appears to be associated with increased 
vegetative propagation. 
 
Management 
Common St. Johnswort does not exhibit invasive 
tendencies in undisturbed areas, but in disturbed areas it is 
much more dominant. St. Johnswort can be potentially 
invasive in prairie, mountain grassland, western 
hardwoods, maple-beech-birch complex, oak-hickory and 
oak-pine complexes. Repeated cultivation has been found 
to destroy the weed. Colonies can also be controlled by 
mowing several times before maturation. Additionally, a 
covering of grass litter may be used to reduce germination 
and shoot extension of St. Johnswort. Vegetative 
propagation may be encouraged by grazing or fire. 
 
Pests and Potential Problems  
Winter warming and summer droughts increase 
herbivory. Insect herbivory has a strong negative effect on 
populations and when treated with insecticide, treated 
plots have twice the seedling survival rates as untreated 
plots. There is a high degree of phenotypic and genotypic 
variation between St. Johnswort populations, and 
herbivore resistance is also variable. 
 
Environmental Concerns 
 
Common St. Johnswort has small black glands that 
contain the photodynamic pigment hypericin. Hypericins 
are found in the flowers, leaves, and buds of the plant. If 
digested by livestock, hypericin can cause 
photosensitization, blisters, and lesions. especially in 
light-skinned animals. More severe symptoms include 
loss of appetite, diarrhea, blindness, convulsions, coma 
and death.  
 
Control 
Please contact your local agricultural extension specialist 
or county weed specialist to learn what works best in your 
area and how to use it safely. Always read label and 
safety instructions for each control method.

The evergreen foliage is stiff and leathery in texture, 
with large, remotely spined teeth.  The leaves are 
arranged alternately.  They are 2 to 4 inches long, 
satin green and smooth above, and yellowish-green 
below. 
Small, axillary, greenish-white flowers bloom from 
April to June. Like most others in the holly genus, 
American holly is dioecious.  Pistillate flowers 
emerge in small clusters from one plant, while 
staminate flower clusters develop on another.  Newly 
established plants will not flower for 4 to 7 years. 
prior to flowering there is no practical means of 
determining the gender of a plant.  Bright red, rarely 
orange or yellow, globular fruit mature from 
September to October, but may be retained on the 
plant into the following spring.  The berry-like fruit is 
about 1/3 inch in diameter, and contains 4 to 9 small 
nutlets.  There are an average of 28,430 seeds per 
pound.

dark green summer color turning yellow in fall, then 
drop off by mid-October. 
Small, inconspicuous, axillary, greenish to yellowish-
white flowers bloom from April to July, after leaves 
have emerged. Like most others in the holly genus, 
winterberry is dioecious.  Three years after planting, 
pistillate flowers begin to emerge in small clusters 
plants and staminate flowers develop on male plants 
with up to twelve flowers in a cluster. only now can 
plant gender be determined. Scarlet red to orange,

 Caution:  Ingestion of berries causes nausea and 
vomiting.  Yaupon is the only plant native to North 
America that contains caffeine. 
Alternate Names 
Yaupon holly, cassena, cassina, cassine, evergreen 
cassena, evergreen holly, Indian black drink, Christmas 
berry.   
Uses 
Ethnobotanical:  Native Americans in the southeastern 
United States used this plant extensively.  They used the 
wood to build arrows, and roasted leaves and shoots to 
make a dark, tea like drink called “black drink”.  This 
drink was used medicinally to induce vomiting and for 
ceremonies to purify the body.  It was also used socially 
as a drink or offering to indicate friendly intentions to 
guest. 
 
Landscaping:  Yaupon makes an excellent hedge plant.  It 
is an evergreen, and when trimmed correctly, produces a 
thick screen of vegetative material.  Individual specimens 
can be readily trimmed into ornamental designs and 
shapes.  Yaupon is adapted to a wide array of soils and 
climate conditions.  It is disease free, moderately fast 
growing, and tolerates drought extremely well once 
established.  Female plants produce numerous, showy red 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
berries in the fall as long as male plants are available for 
pollination.   
 
Wildlife:  Many species of song and game birds utilize the 
berries in the fall.  Small mammals such as raccoons, 
skunks, foxes, and armadillos will also consume berries.  
Deer browse the foliage, but it is not considered preferred 
browse.  Yaupon is capable of forming dense, monotypic, 
thickets, which provide excellent cover for a wide array of 
wildlife, especially in winter after most plants have 
dropped their leaves.                   
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
Description and Adaptation 
Yaupon is a native, perennial, evergreen shrub capable of 
reaching approximately 30 feet in height under ideal 
conditions.  The bark is smooth, light grey with lighter 
grey to nearly white splotches.  The leaves are alternate 
and oval in shape.  They are dark green with a leathery 
appearance and a lighter colored underside.  The leaf 
margins have a slight serration that easily distinguishes 
this species from the similar looking, invasive, non-
native, Chinese privet, Ligustrum sinense Lour. Chinese 
privet has come to occupy a similar niche in the 
environment since it was introduced through the 
horticulture and landscape industry in the late 1800s.     
 
Yaupon fruits are small berries with a beautiful, 
translucent, red color.  They form in dense clusters 
throughout the plant and remain attached through winter 
and into spring making them an important winter food 
source for a variety of bird species.  Each fruit contains 4 
hard, oblong seeds or nutlets that have a striated 
appearance.          
Yaupon can be found throughout the southeastern United 
States, especially along the coastal plains, on soils with 
pH between 4.5 and 7.0.  It is adapted to a wide variety of 
soils textures, but typically prefers sandy sites.  It is shade 
tolerant and moderately tolerant to salinity and salt spray.  
Fire and prescribed burns reduce its presence in the 
understory.

Cutting  will  compound  the  plant  density  exponentially 
unless  stumps  are  treated  with  an  herbicide  immediately 
after they are cut.     
Pests and Potential Problems 
Yaupon has no serious pest or disease problems. 
Environmental Concerns 
None. 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
Yaupon is readily available through the commercial 
nursery industry.  There are no released varieties from the 
USDA/NRCS Plant Materials Program.

Yaupon distribution from USDA-NRCS PLANTS Database. 
Establishment 
Yaupon is most easily established via transplants.   It is 
found readily in the wild, and may be dug in the spring 
and fall to avoid the stress of summer heat.  Small 
saplings may then be moved to desired locations or potted 
for later use.  Containerized plants are also available from 
the nursery industry.  Yaupon is a hardy plant that 
transplants well.  Trimming the tops of freshly dug plants 
will help reduce stress via moisture loss.  Seed is reported 
to take up to 18 months to germinate and requires cold 
stratification.  They should be sown in flats in the fall, and 
left outside to over winter.  Transplants may be removed 
from the seedling tray as they appear.  Yaupon does not 
require high fertility, but application of a complete 
fertilizer such as 13-13-13 will increase the speed of 
establishment and promote quicker growth.  Always be 
sure to water transplant in after planting to reduce stress 
and to create good soil to root contact.           
Management 
When used as an ornamental or hedge, keep plants 
watered and fertilized for maximum performance.   
Frequent, light watering will promote shallow root 
development.  Longer, less frequent watering intervals 
promote deeper root development and a more drought 
resistant plant.  Trimming will encourage regrowth and 
creates a densely limbed shrub.  Lower limbs may be 
removed on specimen trees to expose the lightly colored 
bark which provides an attractive contrast with the dark 
green foliage.     
 
Yaupon  can  be  aggressive  and  is  capable  of  forming 
dense monotypic stands, especially in cutover timberland 
in  the  southern  states,  which  may  compete  with  tree 
seedling establishment. This can shade out desirable tree 
plantings.    As  previously  stated,  Yaupon  is  not  fire 
tolerant.    As  fire  frequency  increases,  this  species  will 
decrease.    Yaupon  spreads  via  root  suckers  when  cut.

with brick-red to dark rosy-red, and five petals with 
the upper petal erect.  Flowers are 8-25 inches in 
terminal spike (raceme), from axils of leaves and 
spike longer than subtending leaf and with 7-10 
blooms per spike.  The leaves are alternate, short-
stalked with blades divided into five to nine leaflets, 
and rarely each leaflet to one-inch long.  With a deep 
root system, it is drought tolerant and normally 
prostrate to 50-inches long, and equipped with 
tendrils for climbing.  The mature seed pods range 
from one-two inches long, with a sharp point.  Pods 
have an average of 10 square seeds, which are 2 mm 
wide and 3 mm long. Seed pods are harvested with 
the combine and threshed with the hammer mill 
before cleaning.  There are approximately 97,000

Adaptation: Western indigo is found in native 
grassland throughout much of central and east central 
Texas, where it is recognized as one of the valuable 
native legumes.  It is apparently adapted to moist soil 
types, from sandy loam through clay loam.  It will 
compete with other plants and has a tendency to 
flatten out under grazing pressure.  Plants range from 
Kansas south to Texas, Florida, Mexico, and Cuba.

and suppress weed invasion.  Do not use mulches that 
may attract rodents.

grass-like perennial which emerges from a stout 
branching rootstock.  The short, finely divided 
rhizomes are 6 to 10 inches long, growing from 1/4 to 
2 inches beneath the soil surface.  The culms are 
smooth, erect, bright green and hollow, with reduced 
basal leaves.  New shoots emerge and develop in late 
summer, reaching up to 4 feet tall at maturity the

from March to September, peaking in July.  
Pollination typically occurs by wind, but occasionally 
it is by insects.  A three celled obovoid capsule 
develops after fertilization, which contains many 
small (.02 to .025 inch long) straw colored seeds.  
There are an estimated 18,000,000 seeds per pound.  
Due to the small size and tacky outer coating, the

taken to protect against rodent predation.  Direct 
seeding onto raised beds or at a site will lead to 
productive results.  Seedlings should be distributed as 
1/0 bare-root or containerized stock.  On fertile 
nursery soils, black walnut should not require 
additional nutrients for adequate growth.

UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_='Distribution and Adaptation 
Black needlerush is one of the dominate species in 
the marshes on the southern Atlantic and Gulf coasts. 
It dominates 20.7% of the marsh in the south Atlantic 
states and 7.3% of Gulf coast marshes. But, it covers 
more marsh area on the Gulf coast than the Atlantic 
coast. Its distribution is continuous from Maryland to 
Florida and westward to southwestern Texas. Black 
needlerush occupies the edge of ditches and 
shorelines of bays, back bays and tributaries of tidal 
systems in coastal systems.  It is well adapted to fine 
and medium textured soils, has a high tolerance to 
anaerobic conditions, high tolerance to calcium 
carbonate (CaCO3) and tolerates pH ranges from 4.0-
7.0 
 
It is usually restricted to coastal marshes and 
estuaries, but it may extend 10 to 15 miles inland 
along river estuaries. For a current distribution map, 
please consult the Plant Profile page for this species 
on the PLANTS Website.

UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_='Establishment 
In the wild, black needlerush establishes from seed, 
rhizomes or vegetative divisions from storm derived 
floatsum. Researchers have shown that black 
needlerush seeds from the Mississippi Gulf coast 
require light for germination. This seed remains 
viable for one year and will germinate at a high 
percentage any time after maturity, and without a 
cold wet stratification.                                                                                
 
Nursery and greenhouse production are effectively 
accomplished with seed or vegetative divisions.  
Divisions should include several good roots, a node 
and three to five green stems.  Seed can also be 
stratified in saturated soil-less potting media with 
high percentage of fine organics.  Seed and media 
can be thoroughly moistened by placing the mix into

traffic better than many other native grasses. At least 
partially due to its small stature, prairie Junegrass is 
very resistant to fire and will often increase in percent 
cover after a fire or other disturbance. In turf settings, 
this species tolerates repeated low mowing.

Description and Adaptation 
Kochia is an introduced, erect, annual forb.  The 
simple, alternately arranged leaves are linear to 
narrowly ovate to 2 inches (5.5 cm) long and can 
have hairs, depending on age.  Leaves are very short 
petioled or sessile.  Stems are green, red tinged, or 
red depending on age.  The flowers are green leaf-
like bracts. It has a spike.  Kochia has small fruits 
with an oval, brown to black seed.  Kochia varies 
widely in morphological characters partially due the 
environment where it is found. 
 
Kochia is native to central and eastern Europe and 
Asia.  Kochia can be found in a very wide range of 
temperatures and climatic regions throughout the 
world, but is particularly adapted to arid and semi-
arid regions.  Kochia is common in rangelands, 
pastures, fields, disturbed sites, gardens, roadsides, 
ditchbanks, and in soils with high salinity.  It can be 
found in areas with as little as 6 inches (15.24 cm) of 
annual rainfall.

Uses 
Kochia is used by wildlife for food and cover.  It can 
be hayed or grazed directly for livestock feed.  
Kochia can be planted for soil erosion control and 
bioremediation of some contaminated sites.  It is used 
in some Asian cultures for food and in some parts of 
Europe and Asia it is planted for making brooms.

For updated distribution, please consult the Plant 
Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
site. 
 
Establishment 
Soil should be plowed or disked and weed free. 
Planting should be done late April to early May.  
Liming of the soil to a pH of 6.0 is recommended. 
Nitrogen should be applied before planting and 
topdressing the remainder later depending on the 
anticipated yield.  Planting can be done by drilling or 
broadcast planting by hand or by airplane. 
 
Management 
Kochia is palatable to all classes of livestock.  It can 
be toxic to livestock and may cause death if 
consumed in large quantities.  It is recommended that 
kochia forage should consist of not more than 50% of 
livestock ration.  Kochia stands can be grazed by 
livestock directly or it can be cut for hay or silage.  
Care should be taken to prevent poisoning. 
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Kochia may be host to various fungi, pathogens, and 
insects, some of which can be detrimental to crops 
like sugarbeet, potatoes, and tobacco. Grasses will 
out compete kochia.  Volunteer kochia is likely to be 
a problem in crops that are planted following kochia. 
 
Environmental Concerns 
Kochia is highly invasive and is able to establish and 
persist in harsh environments where other plants are 
limited.  Kochia may be hard to control once it is 
established in an area.

The abundant trifoliate oval leaves are usually 1.5 
inches long and 1 inch wide.  The pink to purple 
colored flowers of ‘Natob’ appear first in late June to 
early July and continue for 4-6 weeks.  The 
outstanding quality of ‘Natob’ is that the seed 
matures at least a month earlier than common 
bicolor lespedeza.  Bees and insects are necessary to 
adequately pollinate lespedezas.  The small, black, 
bean-like, seeds are singlely produced in pods which 
open when mature.  Seed maturity occurs from late 
September to early October.  Some plants hold seed 
into the winter but most seeds fall by January.

Prior to sowing, the seed must be inoculated with the 
proper rhizobial bacteria.  Seeding should occur from 
the date of last expected frost to no later than June 1.  
If established with broadcasting techniques, 8 to 10 
pounds of seed per acre should be used on well-
worked soils. if drilled into rows, 6 to 8 lbs./ac. will 
be acceptable rates.  When co-planting switchgrass 
with bicolor lespedeza, add 5 to 7 pounds of grass 
seed to the rates listed above.  Seed should be sown 
1/2 to 1 inch deep depending on soil conditions.  Use 
an adequate mulch such as straw or wood fiber mulch 
to hold seed in place on highly erodible sites and help 
retain moisture on droughty sites. 
Use normal tree planting procedures to establish 
seedlings at 2 to 3 feet in row spacing with 3 to 4 feet

Uses 
Manystem wildrye is primarily used for reclamation of 
wet, saline soils.  It can be used effectively on saline-
affected, irrigated cropland and pastureland, and on lands 
where the water table is within 3 ft of the soil surface.  It 
is also used for reclamation of saline seep discharge areas 
on dry cropland, where water tables are typically deeper 
than 3 ft and annual precipitation may range from 12 to 
18 inches.   
 
Manystem wildrye is also recommended for use as forage, 
soil stabilization for prevention of wind and water 
erosion, and in wildlife cover plantings.  It is moderately 
palatable to all livestock, especially in the early spring 
before it becomes coarse.

status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
 
Description and Adaptation 
Manystem wildrye is an introduced, perennial, cool-
season, sod-forming grass.  Plants spread by underground 
stems and by seed, sometimes forming distinct clumps, 
and flowering culms reach 19 to 32 inches tall.  Leaf 
blades are grayish green, stiff and flat early in the growth 
season, becoming rolled later in the year.  There are 
approximately 150,000 to 175,000 seeds/lb.   
 
In its native range in Eurasia, manystem wildrye is found 
in alkaline meadows and saline soils, and as a weed in 
fields, roadsides, and around human habitations.  In the 
intermountain West, it is adapted to wet, saline meadows, 
where rainfall exceeds 9 to 14 inches or where wet, 
saline-alkaline, sub-irrigated sites exist.  Manystem 
wildrye does well on moderately-coarse/sandy to poorly-
drained soils, and ranges from uplands and slopes to 
bottomlands.  It tolerates neutral to strongly alkaline soils 
(pH 6.6 to 9.0) and soils classified as strongly saline 
(greater than 16 dS/m).  Winter hardiness and frost 
tolerance are good, though variable among seed lots, and 
it is moderately shade tolerant.  
 
‘Shoshone’ manystem wildrye has been widely 
introduced throughout the western US, but its exact 
distribution is currently unknown.  For updated 
distribution, please consult the Plant Profile page for this 
species on the PLANTS web site. 
 
Establishment 
Fall dormant plantings are recommended for northern 
regions to overcome seed dormancy.  Spring-planted seed 
must be mechanically scarified to break seed coat 
imposed dormancy.  Seedlings have poor vigor, develop 
slowly, and compete poorly with weeds and other forage 
grasses in the first year of establishment.  It is thus very 
important to minimize weed competition with properly 
prepared seedbeds and weed management prior to 
seeding.  For range and pasture seedings, seeds should be 
drilled into a well-disked seedbed in late fall just prior to 
freeze up at a depth of 0 to ¼ inch and a rate of 6 to 9 
pure live seed (PLS) lbs/acre (for full-rate, monotypic 
seedings).  Alternately seeds can be broadcast at a rate of 
10 to 20 PLS lbs/acre.  
 
Vegetative planting of rhizomes (‘sprigging’) in mid-
September to November is recommended for 
establishment on sites typically saturated or under 
standing water in the spring or early summer, or where 
rapid cover is needed.  Stand establishment from sprigs is

slow during the first year, but once established rhizomes 
spread rapidly to produce better coverage and more forage 
than stands originating from seed.  In Montana, sprigging 
at a rate of 40 bu/acre is recommended for streambank 
protection plantings.      
 
Management 
Once established, stands of manystem wildrye survive for 
many years.  Manystem wildrye has been found to be 
compatible with many other species because it does not 
form a dense, restrictive sod.  It is highly productive for 
hay when planted at a rate of 6 PLS lbs/acre on irrigated 
or subirrigated sites.  Best yields are attained on fields 
with adequate levels of fertility, especially available 
nitrogen.  High concentrations of salts and/or low levels 
of moisture result in poorer stand establishment, lower 
forage yields and slower growth rates.  Forage trials 
conducted on Shoshone manystem wildrye over a 4-year 
period, on fields with moderate fertility, yielded an 
average of 1,750 lbs/acre in Bridger, MT.   
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Manystem wildrye is susceptible to “take-all” disease, 
caused by the root-inhabiting fungus Ophiobolus 
graminis.  A temporary solution to arrest the disease may 
be achieved with an application of P2O5 at a rate of 
100 
lbs/acre.  More drastic follow-up measures to renovate the 
site include plowing to a 6-inch depth, harrowing, and 
irrigating to promote rhizome emergence.  Manystem 
wildrye varies in resistance to leaf rust, stripe rust, and 
ergot.  No ill effects are known from livestock 
consumption of the infected material.  
 
Environmental Concerns 
Manystem wildrye is known to produce fertile hybrids 
with beardless wildrye (Leymus triticoides).  Seed 
production in these species is poor so hybrid offspring 
should not have a competitive advantage in native plant 
communities.   
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
‘Shoshone’ was released in 1980 as beardless wildrye 
(Leymus triticoides) through a cooperative agreement 
between the Bridger PMC and the agricultural experiment 
stations of Montana and Wyoming.  After its release, 
however, Shoshone was determined to be Leymus 
multicaulis.  The original collection was made in 1958 
from the Riverton, WY fairgrounds, possibly from a 
seeded stand established in the 1940s from an unknown 
source.  Shoshone is adapted to a wide range of soil 
textures on sub-irrigated sites in most areas of Montana 
and Wyoming, as well as northwestern Colorado and 
southern Idaho.  It is a cool-season, moderately tight sod-
forming cultivar selected primarily for forage, 
stabilization, or cover on wet or moist-saline-alkaline

Rice cutgrass is a native cool season grass that grows 
and flowers comparatively late in summer.  The seed 
ripens in late August to early October, more typical 
of a warm season species.  This short to medium 
lived perennial spreads by scaly, underground 
rhizomes and often forms dense colonies.  The stalks 
(stems) are upright to sprawling, velvety at the nodes 
(joints), and 90 to 125 (150) cm tall.  Leaf blades are 
7 to 30 cm long, 6 to 15 (20) mm wide, and yellow-
green in color.  They have a coarse or rough upper 
surface and are lined with tiny teeth along the 
margins.  The flowerhead (panicle) is open, often 
drooping, and 10 to 20 cm long.  Some panicles 
remain enclosed within the lower leaf sheaths and 
release seeds upon decay of the stem.  The seed hull 
is covered with minute bristles that readily cling to 
clothing or fur for dispersal.  Rice cutgrass is 
widespread across southern Canada and most of the 
United States.  It is also found in the warmer parts of 
Europe. 
 
Key to identification:' WHERE symbol='leor';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD fs_ TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_='This grass is quickly identified 
by running a hand through it.  The sharp leaves can 
cut flesh and tear weaker clothing.  They are abrasive 
and sandpapery to the touch.  Seeds resemble rice 
and are not easily confused with other native grasses.  
The spikelets hang in a single row creating a 1-sided 
appearance to each panicle branch.   Rice cutgrass 
can easily be confused with two other species of 
Leersia commonly found in North America.  Consult 
botanical keys for proper ID. 
 
Relative abundance in the wild: Rice cutgrass is 
occasional to very abundant.  Once stands are 
located, seed is easily stripped by hand.  Retention of 
seed is fair at best.  Seed shatters (drops) readily at 
maturity. 
 
Adaptation: Rice cutgrass can be found in a variety 
of wet, sunny, and partially shaded sites.  However, it 
is most common near streams, ponds, or beaver areas, 
and in ditches, canals, or freshwater marshes.  This

species thrives best in nutrient rich mud and slow 
moving or stagnant water.  Seedlings may not survive 
submergence for more than 2 to 3 days, while mature 
plants easily tolerate seasonal to permanent flooding.  
Reportedly, this grass can grow in standing water up 
to 0.5 (15 cm), 1 ft (30 cm) or 3 ft (1 meter) deep.  
It can be found in other habitats where soils are 
saturated at or near the surface year round or 
continuously moist in summer.  It occasionally co-
exists with reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea) 
on wetter sites, but is much less broadly adapted.  
Soils may range from acid to alkaline [pH (3) 5.1 to 
8.8] sands, silts, loams, or clays.  For natural 
regeneration, rice cutgrass needs bare mud and an 
open vegetative structure created by seasonal 
inundation and regular disturbance.

eastern Asia.  It grows 4 to 6 feet tall stems that may 
reach 1/2 inch in diameter.  These stems die back to 
the ground annually.  The leaves are usually 2 inches 
long and 1/2 inch wide, with a more linear 
appearance than oval.  The pink to purple colored 
flowers emerge in great masses during late summer.  
Bees and insects are necessary to adequately pollinate 
lespedezas.  This species of lespedeza easily 
hybridizes with others of the genus, so isolation is 
necessary.  The small, black, bean-like, seeds are 
singly produced in pods which open when mature.  
Seed maturity occurs from late September to early 
October.  Approximately 300 to 500 pounds of seed 
is produced per acre on production fields.  There are 
about 72,000 seeds per pound.  This species has a

mentioned widely as a food source of native people. 
The Lakota pulverized the roots of gayfeather and ate 
them to improve appetite. For heart pains they 
powdered the entire plant and made a tea. The 
Blackfeet boiled the gayfeather root and applied it to 
swellings. They made a tea for stomach aches, but 
sometimes just ate the root raw instead. The Pawnee 
boiled the root and leaves together and fed the tea to 
children with diarrhea. The Omaha powdered the root 
and applied it as a poultice for external inflammation. 
They also made a tea from the plant to treat 
abdominal troubles. The roots were also used as a 
folk medicine for sore throats and as a treatment for 
rattle snake bite. 
 
Horticultural: Gayfeather plants are becoming more 
popular for ornamental uses, especially fresh floral 
arrangements and winter bouquets. The 
inflorescences make good long lasting cut flowers. If 
spikes are picked at their prime and allowed to dry 
out of the sun, they will retain their color and can be 
used in dried plant arrangements. Dotted gayfeather 
is a good addition to a sunny flower garden or a 
prairie planting for its long lasting purple color in late 
summer and early fall. This species also offers 
promise for roadside and rest stop beautification 
projects in the Great Plains region.

 General: Dotted gayfeather belongs to the composite 
or sunflower family (Asteraceae). Dotted gayfeather 
is a native, perennial species that is 1 to 2.5 feet tall 
with one to many stems arising from a woody crown. 
It has a deep tap root which extends up to 7 feet in 
heavy clay soils and to 16 feet in lighter soils. Strong 
lateral roots branch in the first three feet, but they all 
penetrate deeply and most absorptive rootlets are at 
the deeper levels. Its leaves are alternately arranged 
on the stem, are closely spaced and linear, being up 
to six inches long and ¼ inch wide. The leaves are 
dark green with a light colored midrib and covered 
with translucent glandular dots. Dotted gayfeather 
leaves arch upward, have ciliate or hairy margins and 
get progressively shorter the closer they get to the 
stem apex. A dense spike up to a foot long at the end

of four to eight disc flowers each. Flowering occurs 
from August to October in Kansas. Spikes bloom for 
a long time as flower heads bloom successively from 
the top down. The fruits are black ribbed achenes that 
are approximately ¼ of an inch long and have 
numerous feathery bristles at the tips. The achenes 
are easy to collect from the spikes when they are dry 
in October into November.   
 
Adaptation: This species is ideally suited to grow in 
dry, coarse soils with its extensive root system and 
limited foliage of linear, narrow leaves. 
 
Distribution: Please consult the Plant Profile page for 
this species on the PLANTS Web site. Dotted

success. Prepare a firm, weed free seedbed by 
disking, harrowing and cultipacking the planting site. 
Chemical weed control can be used prior to planting 
to minimize weed competition. Plant the seed units of 
dotted gayfeather utilizing a drill with a legume box 
and depth bands to ensure that correct depth of 
planting (1/4 inch) and good seed to soil contact. If 
establishing this species for seed production 
purposes, planting in rows is desirable with a rate of 
30 Pure Live Seed (PLS) per foot of row. For prairie 
restoration or diverse plantings intended for wildlife 
use, 4 ounces of seed per acre can be incorporated 
into the seeding mixture. Apply no fertilizer the 
establishment year unless the soil test indicates 
severely limited potassium or phosphorus levels at 
the planting site. No nitrogen should be used the

stems grow erect to a height of 5 feet.  The narrow 
leaves on the lower two-thirds of the plant are so 
crowded that to the casual observer they may appear 
spiraled rather than closely alternate.  Lower leaves, 
up to 4 inches long and ½ inch wide, are larger than 
those further up the stems.  Both the leaves and stems 
usually display short, stiff hairs.  
The top two-thirds of prairie blazing star is a spike of 
rose-purple, thistle-like flowers that are given a 
somewhat fuzzy appearance by extended white 
stamens (male flower parts) and pistils (female 
flower parts).  Flowering starts at the top of the spike 
and moves progressively downward.  Each flower 
head along the spike is made up of 5 to 12 tubular 
florets.  A dense circle of bracts (tiny, modified 
leaves) surrounds the base of each flower head.  The 
tips of these long, pointed bracts tend to spread and 
curve back toward their bases.  Bracts of this species 
may have a purplish tinge.  
 
All Liatris produce flowers in wand-like spikes or 
racemes.  Their flowers are produced in late summer 
and autumn.  They multiply by offsets from their 
cormlike base, or may be grown from seed, which 
should be sown in autumn.  They will grow and 
produce flowers in poorer soil than most garden 
plants, but thrive best in good, rich garden soil, and 
require no special care.  The showiest species are 
Liatris elegans and Liatris pycnostachya.  The 
slender seeds of Liatris are usually less than 1/4 inch 
long.  The seed narrows toward the base and is tipped 
with a set of soft bristles about as long as the seed 
itself.  There are 10 ribs or ridges running along the 
length of the seed.  Prairie blazing star seeds per 
pound average 131,000.

Lonicera canadensis  
 Bartram ex Marsh 
Plant Symbol = LOCA7 
Contributed by: USDA NRCS Cape May Plant Materials 
Center and Columbus Service Center, New Jersey  
 
William B. Skaradek, USDA NRCS 
 
Alternate Names 
Canadian fly honeysuckle, Fly honeysuckle, Xylosteon 
ciliatum 
 
Uses 
Current uses are primarily for the restoration of natural 
areas on National Park Service lands. American fly 
honeysuckle is a valuable pollinator support species, and 
should be incorporated in seeding mixtures for wildlife 
habitat and plant community diversification.   
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g. threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
 
Description and Adaptation 
American fly honeysuckle is a native perennial shrub that 
grows to about 2 meters (7.5 ft.) in height.  It is loosely 
branched with slender twigs and spreads slowly.  From 
April-July it flowers with yellow and whitish blooms. 
fruiting in July-Aug.  It occurs in native woodlands and is 
 
 
 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
readily located in many diverse eco-tones which include. 
rock outcrops, droughty gravels/rocky soils as well as 
marginal lowlands where soil is more moist and fertile.  
Fly honeysuckle seems to tolerate full sun to partially 
shaded sites. 
 
Establishment 
American fly honeysuckle roots readily from cuttings and 
is successfully propagated from seed.  Plant materials 
were out-planted from nursery 1-quart and 1-gallon pots 
for plant community restoration.  Plants from both sizes 
exhibited a high level of survival when out-planted in the 
spring and late spring months, and when standard 
guidelines for shrub plantings were followed. 
 
Management 
During the year of establishment, as with most shrubs, 
ensure adequate water is made available to the planting 
site.  Also protect from mowers and traffic during the first 
year. 
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
This native shrub does not seem to exhibit any major 
damage from pests, disease or browse. 
 
Environmental Concerns 
Not  known  to  be  invasive.    Consult  PLANTS  database 
since  this  shrub  has  been  listed  as  extirpated  and 
endangered in several states. 
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin): 
Currently commercial availability of American fly 
honeysuckle is very limited and commercial cultivars are 
not known.

UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_Establishment='For forage production birdsfoot trefoil is typically 
seeded at 4 to 8 pounds per acre either alone or with a 
grass.  Seeding rates for erosion control practices 
may run considerably higher depending on the mix 
and geographic location.  Seed should be inoculated 
and drilled 1/4 inch deep during early spring or late 
summer, with orchardgrass, timothy, meadow foxtail, 
or tall fescue.  If planting in late summer or in sandy 
soils, increase seeding depth to ½ inch.  Midsummer 
seedings are hazardous unless soil moisture is above 
normal and growing conditions are good.  Seedbed 
preparation and seeding must be done carefully.  
Seed is small and many stands are lost by poor 
seedbed preparation, deep seeding, inadequate soil 
fertility, poor inoculation or failure to use specific 
inoculant, and excessive competition from weeds.  
The seedbed needs to be mellow, firm and smooth.  
Band seeding of birdsfoot trefoil is highly 
recommended. Fertilize and lime according to soil 
tests.   Phosphorous is particularly critical in low 
fertility soils and is best utilized if banded 1½ - 2“ 
directly below the seed.  Since birdsfoot trefoil 
seedlings grow quite slowly, rapidly growing weeds 
will shade and stunt its growth.  Early weed control

planting.  Control pests, especially spittlebugs and 
leafhoppers.

Regrowth of birdsfoot trefoil differs from that of 
alfalfa in that it originates at buds formed in leaf 
axils. Close grazing that takes all stem growth is very 
detrimental to regrowth and stand life.  Delay spring 
grazing until plants are at least 8 inches high.  Allow 
24 to 38 days regrowth between grazings and leave a 
4 inch stubble after grazing.  Additionally, 60 day 
rest periods every 3 years helps to maintain the stand.  
Hay harvest should leave 4 to 6 inches of stubble to 
ensure good regrowth.   
 
Birdsfoot trefoil does not cause bloat in ruminant 
animals.  To protect the life of the stand, it does 
require careful management.  Birdsfoot must be 
allowed to grow to maturity every third year or so in 
order to produce a seed crop--thus sustaining the 
stand.  Birdsfoot trefoil benefits from readily 
available phosphorous.  Phosphorous should be 
applied annually based on local soil testing 
recommendations.

Lotus crassifolius (Benth.) Greene 
Plant Symbol = LOCR 
Contributed by: USDA NRCS Corvallis Plant Materials 
Center 
Big deervetch in flower, © G. D. Carr, 2006. 
 
Alternate Names 
Alternative common names:  buck lotus, broad leaved 
lotus, thick-leaved lotus, thickleaf trefoil, thickleaf bird s-
foot trefoil, Otay Mountain lotus (=L. crassifolius var. 
otayensis)  
Alternative scientific names: Hosackia crassifolia. Lotus 
aboriginus (=Lotus crassifolius var. subglaber) 
Uses 
Wildlife/livestock forage: The seed and foliage of big 
deervetch are eaten by elk, black-tailed deer, quail and 
other game birds, nongame birds and small mammals.  
Plants are palatable to livestock and withstand grazing 
with the help of their perennial roots and rhizomes.  
Crude protein content is generally high (8–18%), 
especially on grazed clear-cut test plots.    
 
 
 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
Pollinators: The flowers attract hummingbirds, 
butterflies, honeybees and native bees, and can be 
incorporated into hedgerow or pollinator plantings.  The 
plant also serves as a larval food source for butterflies 
such as the silver spotted skipper. 
Restoration/erosion control: Big deervetch is an early 
colonizer of disturbed areas, and because it is a 
rhizomatous legume it stabilizes soil while adding 
essential nitrogen and organic carbon to depleted soils.  
Plants often volunteer on bare road cuts, and can be 
direct-seeded or established from root cuttings onto 
disturbed sites such as old roadbeds, road cuts, clear-cuts, 
fire-damaged land, stream banks and pastures for erosion 
control cover and critical area plantings. 
Status 
The Otay Mountain variety of big deervetch is ranked 1B 
by the California Native Plant Society (Plants Rare, 
Threatened, or Endangered in California and Elsewhere) 
because its occurrence is limited to a few highly restricted 
populations in California.  Variety crassifolius is common 
and widespread.  Please consult the PLANTS Web site 
and your State Department of Natural Resources for this 
plant’s current status (e.g., threatened or endangered 
species, state noxious status, and wetland indicator 
values). 
Description and Adaptation 
Fabaceae (Pea family): Big deervetch is a robust, native, 
herbaceous, perennial legume.  Plants are winter dormant, 
even in mild growing climes.  They can easily regenerate 
from lateral roots and rhizomes, as well as deep taproots 
that may later become exposed near the soil surface 
following disturbance.  Plants are sprawling to erect, 1–5 
feet tall, and stems have a hollow base.  Compound leaves 
have 7–23 leaflets that are about 1 inch long, elliptic to 
egg-shaped, generally 1–2.5 times longer than wide, 
bright green on the upper surface and paler below.  
Flowers are arranged in umbels of 7–20 small (about ½ 
inch), yellow-green, pea-like flowers that become dark 
red or purple-blotched with age.  A tubular, lobed calyx 
half encloses the petals and gives the inflorescences a 
pink to deep red color.  Fruits are oblong (1.4–2.8 inches 
long by 0.1–0.2 inch wide) and hairless, with several dark 
brown seeds per pod.  Bloom period extends from May to 
August depending on latitude and elevation, with seeds 
generally ripening late June to September.  There are two 
varieties of big deervetch: var. otayensis is covered in 
long, soft, wavy hairs, while var. crassifolius is hairless or 
has straight, stiff, sharp hairs that lay flat against the stem.  
There was formerly another recognized variety of big 
deervetch, var. subglaber, but this is now generally 


Page 2
 
considered a separate species, L. aboriginus (=Hosackia 
rosea), rosy bird’s-foot trefoil.  Lotus aboriginus can be 
distinguished from L. crassifolius by its lower elevation 
coast range distribution (below 2600 ft), smaller stature 
(0.3–2.3 ft), leaflet length 2–3 times width, fewer flowers 
per inflorescence (6–10), and white flowers tinged with 
red or purple.  
Big deervetch is common in openings in chaparral, pine 
or mixed woodlands, as well as on stream banks, 
disturbed areas and roadsides.  It is a fast grower that does 
best in full sun on fine- to medium-textured, well-drained 
soils.  It grows in areas with 14–80 inches mean annual 
precipitation, but is drought-tolerant and tolerates 
temperatures down to -3°F.  Plants are fire-stimulated, 
germinating readily from the seed bank, even after intense 
fires.  Its native range includes southwestern Washington, 
western Oregon, California and Baja California, Mexico 
at elevations up to 8000 feet.  Variety otayensis is found 
only on Otay Mountain, San Diego County, CA and into 
Baja California.  For updated distribution, please consult 
the Plant Profile page for this species on the PLANTS 
Web site.

has both physical and physiological inhibitions to 
germination, so seed should be scarified by mechanical 
abrasion of the seed coat, and stratified by moist chilling 
prior to sowing.  Seed can be scarified in a Forsberg seed 
scarifier with 220 grit sandpaper for 10 to 15 seconds in 
order to overcome physical seed coat dormancy, followed 
by cold-moist stratification for at least 60–90 days to 
overcome the physiological dormancy.  With these 
treatments, germination rates can reach 80-85% for good 
seed lots.  Treatment with boiling water has been 
proposed as an alternative to mechanical scarification in 
some Lotus species, but further testing is required to 
evaluate the success of these treatments on big deervetch 
germination.  Scarified seed can be direct-seeded in the 
fall to stratify in situ, germinating in the spring when the 
soil begins to warm.  Like most legumes, establishment 
success, plant vigor and nodulation will be improved by 
inoculating seed prior to sowing.  This can be 
accomplished by making a slurry from soil and/or root 
nodules of existing big deervetch (or similar) plants, or 
purchasing rhizobia (nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria) 
inoculants from a commercial source.  Seedlings are often 
slow to establish initially, so a good weed management 
plan should be in effect prior to planting in order to 
minimize competition.  There are about 48,600 seeds per 
pound.  Sown alone, the suggested seeding rate is 4–8 
pure live seed (PLS) pounds per acre, or 4–8 seeds per 
square foot.  
Management 
Plants require little management once established. they 
are long-lived, drought-tolerant, and re-sprout or 
germinate readily after fire and other major disturbances. 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Pocket gophers can do significant damage to plantings of 
big deervetch.  There are no other records of specific pest 
or disease problems, but plants may be expected to be 
susceptible to insect pests and diseases similar to those 
found on other native Lotus species. 
Environmental Concerns 
There are no known environmental concerns associated 
with big deervetch. 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
There are no improved or selected materials of big 
deervetch, but container plants and/or seed are sometimes 
available from commercial sources on the West coast.

Conservation- Twinberry honeysuckle is a valuable shrub 
for streambank erosion control and restoration of riparian 
areas, swamps, bogs, moist woodlands, scrub-shrub 
wetlands, and sandy coastal areas within its native range.  
Winter dormant branches are useful as live stakes, 
fascines, and other soil bioengineering practices for 
stabilizing streambanks, moist slopes, and the immediate 
shoreline of lakes or ponds. The species is also used in 
hedgerows and pollution resistant wind shelters.  
 
 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
Wildlife - The berries are eaten by bears, small mammals, 
game birds including quail and grouse, and songbirds 
such as thrushes. The flower is a source of nectar for 
hummingbirds and butterflies. The plant is host for the 
larva of certain butterflies including Gillett’s 
checkermallow.  Value as general wildlife cover is high, 
but as browse its desirability is rated low for most large 
game animals.  However, elk, moose, mountain goats, and 
deer are reported to utilize the leaves or twigs in some 
areas. The species is rated as poor forage for domestic 
cattle and fair for sheep. 
 
Ethnobotanic – Reports on the fruit vary from poisonous, 
to mildly toxic, to bitter and unpalatable, to edible and 
useful as food, depending on tribe, region or publication.  
The berry was used as a source of dye. Medicinal uses 
were many and varied among tribes. These included the 
leaves, berries or bark as a decoction, infusion, or poultice 
for sores, body cleansing, swellings, dandruff,  wounds, 
infections, sore throats,  paralysis, coughs, burns, itches, 
venereal diseases, boils, stomach troubles, pains of the 
legs or feet, arthritis, and sore eyes.  Sometimes the leaves 
or bark were simply chewed for treating ailments or used 
as a ceremonial emetic (i.e. to induce vomiting).

Twinberry honeysuckle occurs from the sea coast to high 
elevations in alpine regions. It ranges from Alaska south 
to Mexico and west through the Rocky Mountain states, 
as well as most of Canada.  The species is adapted to soils 
that vary from course sand to fine textured silt and clay 
with a pH of 5 to 8 (moderately high acidity to slightly 
basic).  Found on moist, seasonally wet, and flooded sites, 
habitats include moist woods, thickets, riparian zones and 
bogs.  It also occurs in brackish tidal swamps and sandy 
areas along the coast.  While tolerant of full sun, 
twinberry honeysuckle is most commonly found under 
shady conditions. It will grow on upland soils with 
moderate fertility but drought tolerance is lacking.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD fs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_Establishment='Seed is obtained by collecting the ripe berries from July 
through September then macerating the fruit to separate 
the seed from the pulp. The seed should be cold moist 
stratified (moist chilled at 33-36°F) for 30 to 90 days in 
order to overcome embryo dormancy and improve 
germination.  Air dried seed can be stored in sealed 
containers under cool temperatures for up to 15 years. 
There is an average of 327,000 seeds per pound. 
Unstratified seed should be fall sown and covered with a 
thin layer of soil and 1-2 in. of organic mulch. 
 
Vegetative propagation in containers or beds is easy from 
hardwood (winter dormant), softwood (spring) and semi-
hardwood (summer) cuttings, or layering of stems if the 
soil or growth media is kept moist. Rooting hormones are 
generally not required, but may be helpful for some 
clones or populations.  In western Oregon and western 
Washington, establishment from direct installation of live 
stakes on streambanks and other moist revegetation sites 
in fall or winter has been moderately successful. Live 
stakes are unrooted, dormant 18 to 36 in. cuttings made 
from older branches and planted with at least 70 percent 
of the length in the soil. As with container or bareroot 
nursery stock, survival and growth are improved if stakes 
are mulched or irrigated the first full growing season, 
weeds are suppressed, and animal browse curtailed.

RIVERBANK LUPINE 
Lupinus rivularis Douglas ex 
Lindl. 
Plant Symbol = LURI 
Contributed by: USDA NRCS Corvallis Plant Materials 
Center, Oregon 
 
Photo by Amy Bartow, NRCS Corvallis Plant Materials Center, 2008 
Alternate Names 
Alternative Common Names: riverside lupine, streambank 
lupine, stream lupine, nine finger  
Alternative Scientific Names: Lupinus lignipes A. Heller, 
Lupinus amphibium Suksd. 
Uses 
Erosion control: Given riverbank lupine’s rapid growth, it 
can be used as quick cover on critical erosion sites, 
including droughty, steep, low-fertility slopes.  Because 
of the species’ ability to add nitrogen to the soil (through 
N-fixing bacteria), it can also facilitate the establishment 
of grasses and other wildflowers in restoration seedings. 
Wildlife and Livestock: Several species of birds use the 
seed for food.  Birds, rabbits, and other small game use 
the abundant stems for cover.  The flowers provide pollen 
and nectar for bumblebees and other native pollinators 
and beneficial insects.  This species is a potential butterfly 
host plant for the orange sulphur (Colias eurytheme) and 
the western tailed blue (Everes amyntula).  Riverbank 
lupine appears to be compatible with livestock grazing as 
it has low levels of alkaloids, and does not contain 
anagyrine, a compound found in many other lupines that 
causes the birth defect known as ‘crooked calf disease’.  
Likewise, the cultivar ‘Hederma’ produced no toxic 
 
 
 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
symptoms in sheep or calves in a feeding trial, and was 
found to contain very low concentrations of alkaloids. 
Cover Crop: For soil enrichment through nitrogen 
fixation and addition of organic matter, riverbank lupine 
can be seeded as a winter cover and green manure crop, or 
used in reforestation projects.  From laboratory assays, 
nitrogen fixation rates of its root nodules appear high, but 
actual levels of increase in field soil nitrogen have not 
been fully quantified.  
Ornamental: The plant’s showy floral display and 
pleasant scent make it appropriate for certain landscape 
uses along roadsides, around residential areas, and within 
parks where a larger, short-lived wildflower is desired. 
Ethnobotanic: The plants are reported to have been used 
medicinally by the Thompson Indians of British 
Columbia.   
Status 
Riverbank lupine is on red list 1-E (endangered) in British 
Columbia, but is fairly common throughout the rest of its 
range.  It is considered a facultative upland plant (usually 
occurring in non-wetlands, but occasionally found in 
wetlands) in the northwest, but a facultative plant (equally 
likely to occur in wetlands or non-wetlands) in California.  
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
Description and Adaptation 
Riverbank lupine is a native, rapid-developing, deep tap-
rooted, multi-stemmed, erect forb, 1 to 5 feet tall.  The 
plant may be an annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial.  
In Oregon, its habit can be like an evergreen subshrub.  At 
least some populations appear to possess few if any basal 
buds, with most new shoot growth arising primarily from 
aerial portions of the plant in the second year.  The leaves 
are alternate, palmately compound, with 5 to 9 leaflets 
that average 1½ inches long.  Attractive purple-blue to 
white pea-type flowers bloom March to July, depending 
on latitude and elevation, and last for about two to four 
weeks.  The sparsely hairy pods up to 2 inches long 
contain 6-10 seeds that are gray with dark mottling, often 
with a black stripe on each side.   
Riverbank lupine is adapted to well-drained, sandy or 
gravelly soils of Oregon and Washington west of the 
Cascades, southwestern British Columbia, and 
northwestern California at elevations below 6,000 feet in 
regions with a precipitation range of 18 to 100 inches.  
Persistence is best on soils low in nitrogen, such as sand 
dunes, cut slopes along roadsides, or dredge spoils, where 


Page 2
competition is reduced.  Best growth and development are 
achieved when the plant is grown in full sun.  It is an 
excellent pioneer species.  For updated distribution, 
please consult the Plant Profile page for this species on 
the PLANTS Web site. 
 
 
Riverbank lupine distribution from USDA-NRCS PLANTS Database. 
Establishment 
Seed should be mechanically scarified or soaked in hot 
water (180°F) to overcome physical dormancy and 
enhance germination rates.  Establishment and subsequent 
growth may also be improved by inoculating with the 
appropriate rhizobia (N-fixing bacteria) prior to planting.  
Riverbank lupine can be seeded either in early fall or in 
the spring at 4 to 20 lbs/acre, depending on the site and 
seed mixture desired, at a depth of ½ to ¾ inch.  Strips for 
landscaping, hedgerows, or wildlife use can be broadcast 
seeded at about 20 lbs/acre.  For all conservation uses 
riverbank lupine can be seeded alone at about 10 lbs/acre, 
or with companion grass-legume mixtures, or into 
existing grass stands at 4 to 20 lbs/acre, depending upon 
need.  Seed production fields can be established on most 
well-drained tillable soils, and are typically planted at 10 
lbs/acre on 24-inch rows.  Summer-seeded, irrigated 
fields should produce a seed crop the following year, but 
fall or spring seeding (with or without irrigation) will not 
produce a seed crop until the second full growing season.  
Plants do not generally re-sprout after they are cut, so 
only one seed crop is produced.  There are between 
15,000 and 31,000 seeds per pound.       
Management 
Riverbank lupine often shades out weedy competitors 
with its rapid growth, and thus requires little weed control 
after establishment.  For seed production, the crop should 
be harvested just before fully mature to avoid excessive 
shatter.  It can be direct combined or windrowed onto 
tarps or paper rolls to dry.  Green seeds thus harvested 
have dried without any apparent loss in viability.  
Pests and Potential Problems 
Insect damage is significant only during seed production 
and is controlled with normal spray programs.  Adult 
diabrotic or striped cucumber beetles (Diabrotica 
trivittata) feed on leaves and blossoms, while lygus bugs 
(Lygus pratensis) cause damage by sucking out the juices 
of developing flowers and fruit.  Powdery mildew is 
common in some years, but is generally not considered a 
problem for wildlife or critical area plantings. 
Environmental Concerns 
It is unknown if all populations of riverbank lupine have 
low toxicity to livestock similar to the cultivar Hederma.  
Because of the production of “hard” seed, volunteer 
plants may appear in agricultural seed production fields a 
number of years after stand removal.  Riverbank lupine is 
known to hybridize extensively with the invasive yellow 
bush lupine (Lupinus arboreus), as well as the native 
seashore lupine (L. littoralis), and these hybrid swarms 
may displace or genetically swamp native stands of 
riverbank lupine.  Seed collection and propagation from 
these hybrids populations by wildflower enthusiasts poses 
a significant threat to the genetic integrity of the species.   
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
‘Hederma’ (Oregon) is a short-lived perennial. in its area 
of adaptation, it may survive three to four years, but it 
tends to act as a biennial.  It is intended for use in western 
Oregon, western Washington, and northwestern 
California, for sites up to 3,000 feet in elevation.  While 
the plant exhibits partial dieback primarily in the second 
winter, it has some evergreen stems and foliage.  This 
cultivar produces 20,000 to 25,000 seeds/lb.  Seed is 
available from several commercial producers or vendors.

Malus mandshurica (Maxim.) Kom., Siberian 
crabapple, is a tall, spreading species, 25 to 35 feet in 
height, best suited to large, open areas.  Profuse, 
fragrant flowers appear in May.  The fruit, which can 
range in color from red to yellow, ripens from August 
to November.  This species is often used in beach 
gardens which offer some protection from salt and 
wind. 
 
 
 
 
Malus coronaria (L.) P. Mill., sweet crab, grows 
upright to as a shrub 15 to 25 feet tall, with pink 
flowers which appear in mid-March.  The large fruit 
is used as a main wildlife food. 
Malus floribunda Sieb. ex Van Houtte, Japanese 
flowering crab, reaches a mature height of 20 to 25 
feet and blooms heavily in May.  The blooms are 
deep pink, fading to white.  The red and yellow fruit 
stays on the branches into the winter, providing a 
food source for wildlife. 
Malus sargeniti Rehd., Sargent crab, is a bushy, 
densely branched shrub, usually twice as wide as it is 
tall. Its white flowers bloom profusely in mid May 
and are followed by deep red fruit, which remains on 
the branches until December.  In addition to the 
general uses listed above, Sargent crab can be 
effectively used as a pruned hedge. 
Malus sieboldii (Regel) Rehd., toringa crab, ranges in

Alternate Names 
Hedge apple, horse-apple, hedge, bodark, Bois d’Arc 
yellow wood, mock-orange, and bow-wood. 
Uses 
Osage orange has a long and interesting history of use by 
both Native Americans and early pioneers. Its wood was 
once in demand for making hubs and wheel rims for horse 
drawn wagons, mine support timbers, posts and many 
other uses where decay resistance was important. Osage 
orange was first cultivated in the south in the early 
1800’s. It was brought north by Professor Jonathan 
Turner, a biology teacher at Illinois College, and 
promoted as a living fence by John Wright, editor of The 
Prairie Farmer. By 1847 Turner was convinced that 
Osage orange was the best fencing material available. He 
described it as “horse high, bull strong and pig tight” and 
it functioned as a “hedge” fence long before the invention 
of barbed wire. By the 1850’s Osage orange hedges made 
the fencing of entire farms possible. The French found the 
Osage Indians making bows from the wood and called it 
Bois d’Arc (meaning wood of the bow). Recently, Osage 
orange has been studied for the chemical properties it 
contains that may be of economic importance. Oil 
extracted from the seeds has been tested for its potential

as biodiesel. The isoflavone pomiferin has been studied 
for its antioxidant activity. Osage orange has also had 
proteolytic enzymes recently discovered in its fruit. 
Status 
Osage orange is a pioneering species forever invading 
exposed mineral soils, particularly over grazed pastures 
and abandoned crop fields. It can be a locally dominant 
tree species in those situations. Please consult the   
PLANTS Web site and your State Department of Natural 
Resources for this plant’s current status (e.g., threatened 
or endangered species, state noxious status, and wetland 
indicator values).  
Weediness 
Osage orange has the potential to invade areas abused by 
poor management and the over grazing of pasture and 
range land. This plant may become weedy or invasive 
in some regions or habitats and may displace desirable 
vegetation if not properly managed.  Please consult with 
your local NRCS Field Office, Cooperative Extension 
Service office, state natural resource, or state agriculture 
department regarding its status and use.  Weed 
information is also available from the PLANTS Web site 
at http://plants.usda.gov.  Please consult the Related Web 
Sites on the Plant Profile for this species for further 
information. 
Description and Adaptation 
 
Figure 2.Osage orange distribution from USDA-NRCS PLANTS 
Database. 
General: Osage orange belongs to the Moraceae, or 
mulberry family. The name Maclura pomifera comes 
from William Maclure (1763 – 1840) an early American 
geologist. and pomifera which means “fruit-bearing” for

the large fruits that it produces on the female trees. It is a 
small to medium size tree 36 to 65 feet tall, with deeply 
furrowed bark and thorny branches. The trunk is usually 
short and divides into several prominent limbs with 
upward arching branches. The root system is diffuse and 
covers large areas with its lateral spread. Leaves are 
deciduous, simple, and alternate or are in clusters at the 
end of short spurs. Their shape ranges from broad-ovate 
to ovate-lanceolate, rounded to subcordate  at the base 
broadly cuneate or acuminate at the apex. Leaves are 2 to 
5 inches (in.) long and 0.75 to 2.5 in. wide and have entire 
margins. Leaf blades are dark green, smooth and waxy 
above. paler green with a few hairs beneath. The color 
turns translucent yellow in the fall. Osage orange trees are 
dioecious and wind pollinated with flowers appearing in 
mid-May to June, after leaves. Staminate (male) flowers 
are globular or in short cylindrical clusters, green, hairy, 
with 4 stamens and large yellow anthers, but no petals. 
Pistillate (female) flowers are in dense, globular clusters, 
0.75 to 1.0 in. diameter at the base of a leaf. The fruit or 
“Hedge ball” is produced in September and is a multiple 
fruit consisting of many 1-seeded druplets fused into a 
globose, yellow-green structure approximately 3 to 5 in. 
in diameter. Female trees may start to bear fruit at about 
10 years old. The individual oval shaped seeds are 
imbedded in the fleshy calyx and are 0.3 to 0.5 in. long. 
Seeds are initially cream colored, but will turn brown with 
age and exposure to air. 
For updated distribution, please consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site.  
Establishment and Management  
Osage orange is easy to plant and establish from seed. 
Fruit should be collected in the fall and allowed to 
naturally decay for several months. Seeds can be 
extracted from the fruit by maceration in water and 
floating or screening off the pulp. Osage orange averages 
about 200 to 300 seeds per fruit. Cleaned seed per pound 
averages about 14,000. Since Osage orange has a slight 
dormancy problem it may require a short pre-chill to 
initiate germination. A 30 to 45 day stratification at 40 
degrees Fahrenheit (°F) is usually sufficient to break 
dormancy and allow seed germination. 
Seeds extracted from fruit that has fermented over winter 
in a cold state do not need stratification in the spring. 
Seeds may be drilled in rows 8 to 12 in. apart, or in bands 
3 to 4 in. wide. They should be covered with ¼ to ½ in. of 
soil. Fall seeded beds should be mulched while spring 
seeded beds do not need to be mulched.  
Pests and Potential Problems 
In a Nebraska nursery, seedlings have been killed by 
damping off and root rot caused by Pythium ultimum and 
 
Rhizoctonia solani . The most important disease of Osage 
orange is Texas root rot caused by Phymatotrichum 
omnivorum. A six year study of shelterbelt plantings in 
Texas and Oklahoma revealed a 6.8 percent loss of 
seedlings of Osage orange to Texas root rot. A result of 
this study was that Osage orange was not recommended 
for use on any soil type in the root rot belt.  
Environmental Concerns 
Like many woody species Osage orange tends to have an 
invasive nature when exposed to poorly managed range 
and pasture land. It can be found on idle acres and on 
abandoned farm land near hedge row plantings. 
Control 
Please contact your local agricultural extension specialist 
or county weed specialist to learn what works best in your 
area and how to use it safely.  Always read label and 
safety instructions for each control method.  Trade names

Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
Horticulturally desirable varieties of Osage orange are  
thornless and fruitless. Several male trees have been 
selected and propagated for these specific traits. ‘Wichita’ 
was a selection by John Pair, horticulturist for Kansas 
State University. ‘White Shield’ was an Oklahoma source 
of a fruitless, thornless male clone whose origin was 
along White Shield Creek in western Oklahoma.

Three-flower melic is a member of the Festuceae 
tribe of the grass family (Poaceae).  Gould (1975) 
notes that the common name three-flower melic is 
inappropriate for most Texas accessions because the 
plants’ spikelets commonly have only two perfect 
florets.

Pecos and East to the western portion of East Texas.  
It is usually found in open woods, on moist canyon

known to cause bloat in livestock, particularly those 
unaccustomed to grazing it.  Heavy use of the pods is 
most noticeable after the spiny burs have been 
softened by fall rains.  While summer grazing 
burclover, sheep often accumulate numerous burs in

Cropland: Burclover is commonly used as a cover 
crop in orchards.  Its rapid, dense growth 
characteristics and its ability as a legume to fix 
nitrogen and thus increase the available soil nitrogen 
supply add to its value for such use.  Burclover is 
particularly useful in orchards and vineyards as a 
reseeding annual used in association with strip cover 
management.  It can be mowed to control excessive 
growth, which will not hinder its ability to produce a 
seed crop for the next year.  After seed maturity it 
can be mowed or disked.

chess, wild oats, and filaree species.  As a winter 
annual, burclover germinates in autumn following the 
first rains of the season and matures early in the 
summer.  It is particularly adapted to mild, moist 
winters and hot, dry summers.  Optimal annual 
rainfall for burclover is 10 to 25 inches. 
Although burclover will succeed in many soil types, 
heavy loams are most suitable and valleys and low 
foothills are generally the preferred sites of natural 
plant development.  This species inhabits all 
exposures and grows well under light conditions 
varying from full sunlight to heavy shade.  It is 
tolerant of slightly alkaline conditions and is less acid 
tolerant than subterranean clover.  Favorable growth 
is usually restricted to a soil pH range of 4.7 to 8.0.  
Flowering period for burclover commonly begins in 
February.  On very moist soils, the plants are later 
maturing than on well-drained lands.

POWDERPUFF 
Mimosa strigillosa  
Torr. and A. Gray 
Plant Symbol = MIST2 
Contributed by: USDA NRCS East Texas Plant Materials 
Center

Center  
 
  
Alternate Names 
Some alternate names include powderpuff, herbaceous 
mimosa and sunshine mimosa. 
Uses 
Powderpuff is utilized by both domestic livestock and 
wildlife. It serves as a food source for cattle, goats sheep 
and deer.  Powderpuff is also an important plant for 
pollinator habitat.  Bees utilize powderpuff as a pollen 
source while little sulphur butterfly caterpillars (Pyristia 
lisa) feed on the foliage. 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
Description and Adaptation 
Powderpuff is a native, warm season, perennial legume 
which may reach up to eight inches in height. Unlike 
other Mimosa species, powderpuff does not have small 
prickles along its stems. The plant produces seed and 
spreads by stems which root to the ground along their 
 
 
 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
length. The leaves are alternately arranged along the stem 
and are bipinnate. The leaflets are sensitive to contact, 
folding up quickly after being disturbed. The plant 
produces a showy pink bloom about one inch long during 
the spring and summer. The flowers develop into small, 
flattened, oblong seed pods which turn brown when 
mature. 
The plant can be found on various soils, especially sandy 
loam. Preferred areas are prairies, grasslands, meadows, 
forest openings, and roadsides. Powderpuff is found 
throughout the southeastern United States. For updated 
distribution, please consult the Plant Profile page for this 
species on the PLANTS Web site. 
 
 
Powderpuff distribution from USDA-NRCS PLANTS Database. 
Establishment 
A soil analysis should be conducted prior to planting to 
determine if soil amendments of phosphorus and 
potassium are needed.  The optimum pH range is 6.2 to 
7.1.  Soils with a pH less than 4.1 are unsuitable and must 
be amended to increase pH. 
 
Seedbed preparation should begin in advance of planting. 
Planting can be completed in spring or early fall. Prepare 
a clean, weed free seedbed using tillage or herbicide 
application. Soil amendments maybe added while 
preparing the seed bed to help incorporate them in the 
soil.  Prior to planting, the soil should be firm, not fluffy 
or powdery. Scarify and inoculate seed with strophostyles 
spec 1 inoculant before planting. Mechanically scarifying, 
nicking or roughing the seed coat, results in better 
germination than chemical scarification or heat 
treatments.  Powderpuff, if inoculated, will fix its own

nitrogen.  Avoid fertilization with nitrogen as it will 
promote weedy pests, and make them more competitive. 
 
If available use a drill type planter to ensure good seed to 
soil contact. Broadcast seeding may be used, however 
additional cultipacking or light dragging should be done 
to cover the seed. Seed should be planted about ¼” deep. 
Crockett germplasm herbaceous mimosa contains 
approximately 30,000 seeds per bulk pound. A seeding 
rate of seven pounds of pure live seed (PLS) per acre is 
recommended. For seed mixes, reduce the seeding rate 
according to the percent desired in the mixture. 
 
Management 
Powderpuff  is  not  an  overly  aggressive  plant  and  other 
plants  will  eventually  come  into  the  stand.  Unwanted 
plants  can  be  controlled  by  mowing.  Glyphosate  can  be 
applied to treat cool season weeds in the winter and early 
spring  when 
is  dormant.. 
However,  powderpuff  may  not  become  dormant  in  the 
most southern portion of its range.

Alternate Names 
Purple bee balm and Horsemint 
 
Uses 
Ethnobotanical:  
Monarda species were used by a number of Native 
American tribes to cure skin eruptions, reduce fevers and 
treat colds.   
 
Landscaping and wildlife:  
Purple Bergamot is an adaptable, easy to grow wildflower 
for moist, sunny to light shade locations.  It is a moderate 
spreader which will form a substantial colony.  It is a 
native and can be part of a good wildlife seed mixture 
where native grasses and wildflowers are seeded together.  
The common name bee balm resulted from the attraction 
of bees by the fragrance.  Many kinds of bees, butterflies 
(especially Fritillaries) and hummingbirds use the curved 
tubular flowers for nectar.  The seeds are eaten by 
goldfinches and other seed eating birds.  It is deer 
resistant and ideal for rain gardens and other plantings in 
moist areas (such as wood edges).

status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
 
Description and Adaptation 
Purple Bergamot is perennial wildflower that grows 2 – 3 
feet tall.  It is a member of the mint family, and has 
square stems.  The leaves have a strong mint fragrance 
when crushed.  Its leaves are oblong and pointed 
(lanceolate) and placed opposite one another on the stems, 
and the stems are topped by a cluster of reddish purple 
tubular flowers that bloom in summer.  The small leaves 
at the base of each flower (bracts) are also purple or 
purplish.  Purple Bergamot spreads through rhizomes 
(horizontal underground stems that produce new plants).  
Purple Bergamot can be found growing in swampy 
thickets, stream beds and ditches.   
   
 
Purple Bergamot distribution from USDA-NRCS PLANTS Database. 
 
For updated distribution, please consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
 
Establishment 
General: Purple Bergamot can be started by seeds, 
softwood cuttings or by dividing the clumps in the spring.  
Collect seed heads in fall and spread them over a clean, 
dry surface indoors to dry for several days.  Then place 
the seed heads in a paper bag and shake them.  The seeds 
will fall out of the seed heads and into the bag.  Then run 
the seeds and associated chaff through a sieve.  Store the 
seeds in a dry sealed and labeled container or reseal able 
storage bag with wet sand or peat moss at 38 - 40 degrees 
F for 3 months.  
 
Propagation by seeds: Seeds sown in flats during January 
and stored in a greenhouse are expected to germinate in 1 
to 2 weeks.  The soil mix can be 1/3 sand and 2/3 
commercial plug mix.  Apply a starter fertilizer solution

for the seedlings.  Water flats when the soil surface is dry 
to the touch.  Keep the seedlings in the flats for 6 - 7 
weeks and then transplant them to 3-inch pots.  Pinch off 
the tops of the plants several times during the growing 
season to encourage branching and a bushier grow habit.  
Apply an all-purpose fertilizer for the transplants on a 
weekly basis.  When the roots fill the container (about 2 
months), they are ready for out planting in the garden.   
 
Seedlings should be planted into a sunny, weed-free, well-
drained soil about 1.5 to 2 feet apart.  Water weekly 
during droughty conditions for the first 2 seasons. 
 
Seeds can also be broadcast on a weed-free surface from 
January to mid-May in sunny locations.  Once the seeds 
germinate, seedlings should be watered during extended 
dry periods.  If weeds are a problem during the first 
summer of growth, mow the area 3 to 5 times to a height 
of 4 and 8 inches to reduce weed competition. 
 
Propagation by cuttings: Take 3- to 4-inch long stem tip 
cuttings at any time from May to August.  Remove the 
lower leaves and all flower or seed heads and insert the 
stems into a sand and perlite rooting medium.  Bury each 
cutting up to the first node.  Place the cuttings in an 
enclosed area and mist them several times a day.  In 4 to 5 
weeks the cuttings should be well rooted and can be 
transplanted to pots.  Transplant to the garden in the early 
autumn. 
 
Management 
Purple  Bergamot  prefers  damp,  acidic  soil. 
  Once 
established,  Purple  Bergamot  still  benefits  from  extra 
watering during dry summers.    Mowing in spring after 
woody  plants 
reduce  woody  plant 
encroachment.    Delaying  mowing  until  spring  will  also 
leave seed heads standing for seed eating birds and other 
wildlife.   In a garden plants  will spread quickly through 
rhizomes. plants may be divided every three years. 
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Purple Bergamot foliage can be infected with powdery 
mildew and rust in humid climates or when the clumps 
become too large and air circulation is reduced.  These 
diseases discolor the foliage and cause the plants to lose 
their leaves prematurately.   This is mainly an aesthetic 
problem and rarely causes long term problems for the 
plant.

Bayberry is a natural selection for conservation 
plantings and for landscaping on coastal sands.  
Though not a legume, it does &quot.fix&quot. nitrogen and is an 
important constituent for revegetation efforts.  In 
conservation plantings, this shrub does best where it 
is allowed to spread naturally by root suckers and 
where sand is accumulated.  The nitrogen that 
becomes available over time will encourage other 
vegetation- generally a good thing unless invasive 
species show up.  Shade from taller vegetation will  
not be tolerated by bayberry and the stand will be 
reduced. 
In landscape plantings, bayberry should be allowed to 
grow naturally with minimal pruning.  Attempts to 
confine it or shape it will usually reduce its vigor and 
may eventually lead to problems.   Disease and 
insects are not usually severe pests, especially where

little maintenance and is excellent for meadow gardens 
and as a general garden plant.  Hairawn muhly is known 
to attract beneficial insects such as ladybug beetles 
(Coccinella spp.).  The clumping habit of hairawn muhly 
makes it excellent for use as wildlife cover.  
 
 
 
 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
Status 
Hairawn muhly is listed as an endangered species in 
Connecticut, Indiana, Maryland, and New Jersey. as 
extirpated in Pennsylvania. and as presumed extirpated in 
Ohio.  Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your 
State Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s 
current status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, 
state noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
 
Description and Adaptation 
Hairawn muhly is a native, perennial, warm-season grass 
that grows from 1–3 feet tall with a 2–3 foot spread.  The 
stems are un-branched and have an upright habit.  The 
wiry, thin leaves are 18–36 inches long, simple (not made 
up of multiple leaflets), and alternate (progressing singly 
up the stem).  The leaves are green throughout the 
summer and turn copper in the fall.  The purplish-red or 
pink flowers are grouped together in a long, diffuse, airy, 
grouping of flowers which mature from the bottom up.  
The cluster of flowers is arranged on a stem that is about 
18 inches long and 10 inches wide and rises above the 
leaves.  The seed stalks are 2–5 feet tall.  Flowers give 
way to oblong tan or brown seed less than half an inch 
long.  Hairawn muhly clumps but does not spread through 
above or underground stems (stolons or rhizomes).

dried for five to ten days.  Collect seeds during the 
warmest and driest time of day using a comb to avoid 
disturbing the appearance of the plant.  For greenhouse

propagation, plant seeds in the winter in order to have full 
plants which are ready for spring planting.  Seeds do not 
need a cold treatment for germination.  If direct-seeded 
outdoors, plant seeds one-eighth of an inch deep in rows 
spaced 24–48 inches apart.  Keep soil moist at all times 
during establishment.  Fertilization is not recommended 
for stands that have been sown directly.   
Propagate by dividing existing clumps in early spring and 
summer.  Do not divide clumps during the flowering 
stage. 
 
Management 
Burn or mow hairawn muhly stands in late winter to 
remove old residue.  Hairawn muhly prefers neutral to 
slightly acidic soils but can tolerate many soil types.  It 
has a low tolerance for high pH soils and a high tolerance 
for salinity.  Hand-weed established stands and fertilize 
according to soil test recommendations.  
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Aphids are known to infest hairawn muhly blooms during 
the early stages of seed development.  Increasing the 
numbers of beneficial insects such as ladybug beetles may 
be a natural means of biological control. 
 
Environmental Concerns 
No concerns at this time. 
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
There are no recommended cultivars or selected materials 
at this time.  Hairawn muhly is available from commercial 
nurseries specializing in native plants.

Deergrass is a significant species to central and 
southern California Native Americans who utilize the 
flower stalks in the foundations of coiled baskets.  
Frequently, thousands of flower stalks are needed for 
completion of each basket.  Culms are gathered in 
late spring while still green, or summer or early fall 
when golden brown depending upon the tribe, 
individual family preference, and elevation of the 
deergrass site.

The bunchgrass is found in dense, large clumps, but 
can occur as a continuous cover in areas that are 
subjected to light or frequent ground fires.  The 
culms are slender, narrow, and spike-like, 3 to 4 feet 
in length and less than 1/2 inch wide.  The numerous, 
small spikelets each have one flower.  The ligule 
(where the leaf blade meets the stem) is firm and 
blunt, 1/8 inch long.  The leaves are 1/16 to 5/16 inch 
wide.  The seeds are small, requiring about 2.5 
million to make one pound.  The dense, basal foliage 
is tufted and these large tufts, up to 6 feet across, are 
a distinguishing feature of the grass, along with the 
whip-like flower stalks.

UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_Uses='In California, dense patches of deergrass provide 
cover during the fawning period of mule deer 
(Odocoileus hemionus) in mountain meadows and 
grassland openings.  The younger palatable tufts are 
grazed by deer, horses, and cattle and can remain 
palatable if continually grazed.  It is particularly 
sought for forage by animals when first resprouting 
after a burn.  Older tufts are poor feed for livestock.  
The seeds provide food for songbirds and probably 
other birds as well.  In sunny openings where 
deergrass occurs, it forms a larval food plant for one 
of the Satyrid butterflies, the California ringlet 
(Coenonympha california) and for the umber skipper 
(Poanes melane).  Massive numbers of ladybugs 
overwinter in deergrass clumps.  Deergrass is a 
valuable streambank stabilizer, as it has an extensive 
root system, and if grown in dense enough colonies, 
it can be an effective weed suppresser.  In California, 
Pacific Gas and Electric is experimenting with 
growing it in dense colonies under powerline 
corridors.  Its long, slender culms (stems) and tall 
tufts make it an attractive plant for the garden.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD fs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_Establishment='Broadcast seeding: In California and the Southwest, 
deergrass can be broadcast seeded in the late spring 
or summer during the months of May, June, July, and 
August, with irrigation. The seeds are tiny and should 
be broadcast on top of the ground, and then run over 
with a ring roller or a culti-packer to compress the 
seeds slightly below the soil surface.  For best results, 
sow at least 4 pounds of PLS (pure live seed) per 
acre, which amounts to 50 seeds per square foot.  
Deergrass is slow-growing and germination rates can 
vary from 2 weeks up to 2 months.  Fertilization of 
deergrass is not recommended, as it usually gives 
weeds a competitive edge.  Site preparation is 
extremely important for good establishment of 
deergrass.  Both repetitive tillage and burning are 
recommended to drastically curtail weed competition.  
Repetitive tillage involves loosening the soil, 
irrigating, and cultivating the area with a disc harrow, 
following with a ring roller to kill the flush of annual 
weeds.  This is done several times prior to seeding to 
reduce the weed seedbank.  Burning involves setting 
fire to all residual dry matter prior to seeding.  
 
 
Container planting: Container planting is a more 
effective and less time consuming way of 
establishing deergrass, but it is more costly than 
seeding on a large scale.  Deergrass seed can be sown 
into flats, seedling plug trays, or reforestation tubes 
in May.  Plants can be planted out from containers in 
the fall of the same year in soil that has been 
moistened with the first rains, using standard planting 
procedures.  Plants can also be sown in the fall in 
flats or containers and planted out the next summer or 
fall in the designated area.  Plants should be spaced at 
a minimum width of 24 inches.  Irrigating is not 
necessary if it is a normal rainfall year.  Site 
preparation is the same as for the section under 
broadcasting seed.  Larger bunchgrasses can also be 
divided in winter or early spring and transplanted.  A 
good stand of deergrass can be established in 1½ 
years by container planting.  It is thought that 
container planting with grown plugs is more effective 
in establishing deergrass than by seed. 
' WHERE symbol='muri2';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD fs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_Management=' 
Once established, deergrass is quite drought-tolerant.  
To maintain its vigor and reduce accumulated dead 
material, deergrass can be mowed or burned every 
 
 
several years.  Burning or mowing should be in the 
fall, after it has gone to seed.  Many tribes 
historically and probably prehistorically enhanced 
deergrass populations through firing deergrass stands 
in the fall in California every 2 to 5 years.  Fires set 
by Native Americans increased flower stalk yields, 
recycled nutrients, cleared away detritus, and 
promoted seedling production in the midst of reduced 
competition from other plants.  According to Native 
American elders, these fires maintained the 
bunchgrass in greater numbers than would have 
occurred under natural conditions.   Knowledge of 
past indigenous fire management of deergrass has 
important implications for mountain meadow habitat 
management for wildlife and maintenance of 
grassland openings within shrublands, woodlands, 
and forests for preservation of indigenous cultural 
traditions.  Some areas could be managed with the 
dual objectives of indigenous harvesting of flower 
stalks and grazing after culm harvest.

grows in colonies.  A member of the wax myrtle or 
bayberry (Myricaceae) family, it can grow to 6 feet in 
height, and is stoloniferous.   Dwarf wax myrtle is 
dioecious, having male and female flowers on 
separate plants.  They bloom in March and April in 
Texas, but April to June in cooler climates.   
 
Members of the wax myrtle family have resinous 
dots on their leaves and the leaves are aromatic.  In 
addition, they have nodules on their roots that help 
fix nitrogen in the soil.  Plants in this family produce 
fruits with a waxy coating. 
 
' WHERE symbol='mypu';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD fs_Adaptation TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_Adaptation='Dwarf wax myrtle can be found from Delaware to 
Florida, and west to Texas and Arkansas.  In Texas, it 
is found in the eastern portion of the state from the 
piney woods of northeastern Texas, to the oak 
woodlands of southern and southeastern Texas.  
Dwarf wax myrtle prefers sandy coastal soils and will 
tolerate wet or dry conditions. Nokes (1986) notes 
that it can adapt to heavier soils, and has been grown 
successfully in Dallas.  Dwarf wax myrtle has 
moderate salinity tolerance.     
 
A close relative of dwarf wax myrtle is common wax 
myrtle (Myrica cerifera).  Common wax myrtle 
grows from 10-30 feet tall, is not stoloniferous, and is 
the only evergreen wax myrtle with wedge shaped 
leaves.  It is usually found in clay soils near streams, 
lakes, and other waterways, as well as in boggy 
grasslands and wet wooded areas.   
 
It appears that some of the literature combines 
Myrica pusilla and Myrica cerifera under the species 
cerifera.  Be sure to carefully read information to 
determine which species is actually being discussed.  
We found only three plant manual authors that 
actually made the distinction: Correll and Johnston 
(1996), Nokes (1986), and Petrides (1986).

Wildlife:  The fruits of the wax myrtles (Myrica

the fruit from drying out in arid climates and may 
help to keep water-borne fruits afloat in wetter ones.  
The branches can also provide good nesting and 
perching habitat for birds. 
 
Restoration:  Dwarf wax myrtle is a good plant to use 
for native area restoration on sandy coastal and 
woodland sites.  Its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil 
and spread by stolons makes it particularly desirable.  
It is a good plant to use in dune stabilization and 
restoration.  On clayey sites, common wax myrtle 
may be a better choice.

UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_Establishment='Dwarf wax myrtle is best reproduced from seed.  
Germination is best if the waxy seed coat is removed 
prior to seeding or stratification (Nokes, 1986).  The 
wax can be removed by hand rubbing (USDA-NRCS 
&amp. USDI-NPS, 1993) or by soaking the seeds in a 
mixture of one teaspoon of lye to one gallon of water 
(Nokes, 1986).  However, it is best to leave the wax 
on until you are ready to use the seed as it increases 
storage viability (USDA-NRCS &amp. USDI-NPS, 1993). 
 
The seeds of the wax myrtle have a dormant embryo 
and require a period of cold, moist stratification.  
This can be accomplished by sowing outdoors in 
cooler weather or stratifying in moist peat for 60-90 
days at 34º to 41º F (Nokes, 1986).  At the Center, the 
seeds took as much as three months to germinate, so 
be patient. 
 
A germination study conducted at the Center in the 
fall of 1999 yielded an average germination of 40% 
after 90 days.  Conditions in the chamber were 12 
hours of dark at 10º C and 12 hours of light at 20º C.  
Seeds were hand rubbed to remove the wax prior to 
being placed in the chamber.  No other treatments 
were used.  Seeds began germinating in about a 
month, and germination continued through the end of 
the study.     
 
There are approximately 84,000 seeds per pound.  
Late fall or early winter seeding and a seeding rate of 
3 grams per square foot are recommended. 
 
Nokes (1986) notes that the wax myrtles can be 
propagated from soft and semi-hardwood cuttings 
treated with a rooting hormone.  We did not have 
good success with this method at the Plant Materials 
Center, and therefore do not recommend it.   
 
Transplants can be made bare-root in the wintertime, 
or balled and burlap plants can be transplanted in the 
warmer months if the location is shady and the soil is 
kept moist.  At the Kika de la Garza Center, small 
plants have been successfully transplanted from 
cone-tainers in early spring.  Use of a rooting 
hormone is recommended with bare-root plantings. 
The use of plastic plant shelters is beneficial to 
protect young plants from heavy browsing, reduce 
plant competition, and create a friendlier 
microclimate until the young plants can get 
established.

INDIAN PLUM 
Oemleria cerasiformis (Torr. &amp. A. 
Gray ex Hook. &amp. Arn.) Landon 
Plant Symbol = OECE 
Contributed by: USDA NRCS Corvallis, Oregon Plant 
Materials Center

Alternate Names  
Oemleria cerasiformis is named for Augustus Gottlieb 
Oemler (1773-1852), a German-American pharmacist and 
naturalist.  Previous scientific names include Nuttallia 
cerasiformis Torr. &amp. A. Gray ex Hook. &amp. Arn. and 
Osmaronia cerasiformis (Torr. &amp. A. Gray ex Hook. &amp. 
Arn.) Greene.  Osoberry is a frequently used common 
name while Oregon plum, Indian peach, and bird cherry 
are also synonyms.  
  
Uses  
Often the first deciduous native shrub to flower in late 
winter, Indian plum is an important early season nectar 
source for hummingbirds, moths and butterflies, native 
bees and other pollinator species.  Indian plum is popular 
for Pacific Northwest restoration projects due to its ease 
of propagation, rapid growth, and wide tolerances for 
various shade and moisture regimes.  The fibrous roots 
resist erosion.  Clones that root more readily can be 
employed in restoration projects as live stakes or as 
rooted cuttings.  With adequate sunlight, it bears 
numerous late winter/early spring flowers from a young

age but root sprouting may limit its landscape use to 
larger settings.  Various small mammals plus foxes, 
coyotes, deer, bears, and many bird species consume the 
‘plums’ and disperse the seed.  For livestock, this species 
is considered unpalatable.  Indian plum fruit is edible for 
humans but is often bitter, even when fully ripe.  Native 
Americans ate the fruit fresh, dried, or cooked.  The bark 
was used as a tuberculosis remedy and a mild laxative.  
Strips of bark were used to bind harpoon tips.  
  
Status  
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g. threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values).  
  
Description  
Indian plum is a fast growing but relatively short-lived 
perennial deciduous shrub or small tree of 6 to 16 feet.  It 
is the only species of its genera and the only member of 
the Prunoid subfamily of Rosaceae that is usually 
dioecious (separate male and female plants) or produces 
more than one fruit per female flower.  Indian plum is 
native and common at lower elevations from extreme 
southwest British Columbia to Oregon’s Willamette 
Valley and surrounding foothills.  Continuing south, it 
becomes less common in the California Coast Ranges to 
Santa Barbara County and western slopes of the Sierra 
Nevada Mountains to Tulare County California.  For 
current distribution, please consult the Plant Profile page 
for this species on the PLANTS Web site.    
  
Fragrant 1/2 inch greenish white flowers usually appear 
by late winter in loose hanging clusters of 10 to 20 
flowers each.  Leaves also emerge early taking advantage 
of sunlight before overstory trees produce leaves and 
shade.  Indian plum leaves are alternate, lance-shaped and 
2 to 5 in. long, with smooth edges that are rolled under 
somewhat.  The leaves are pale green, paler below and 
give off a cucumber-like odor when crushed.  They begin 
turning yellow in mid summer.  Twigs are smooth and 
purplish brown with noticeable orange pores (lenticels).  
Partitions inside the pith (center of the stem) create small 
chambers that are visible when the twig is split 
lengthwise.  The bark has a bitter taste.  The 1/2 inch fruit 
of Indian plum, numbering up to 5 per flower, start out 
tan to pale orange, transition through pink to reddish 
purple, then ripens bluish black with a thin waxy coat.  
The seed is a stone, or pit, that contains cyanoglucosides 
(the bitter, toxic compounds also found in almonds).

specimens.  Older shoots and suckers may be removed or 
limbs pruned back to reduce overall size.  Established 
plants may be cut back to near the crown in winter for 
complete rejuvenation.   
  
Pests and Potential Problems  
Indian plum rarely suffers insect or disease injury but can 
be susceptible to rhododendron lace bug (Stephanitis 
rhododendri) and a conidia producing leaf spot fungus, 
Cylindrosporium nuttallii.  Indian plum may display 
chlorosis (leaf yellowing) on shallow soils overlying 
chalk.  
  
Environmental Concerns  
This plant spreads slowly, mostly by root suckering.  
Although Indian plum seed is dispersed by many birds 
and mammals, it requires a disturbed site in order to 
become established.   
  
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin)  
There are no known cultivars of Indian plum but this 
species is commonly available from western native plant 
nurseries.

Indian plum occurs primarily below 1000 feet elevation 
but up to 5000 ft. in the southern part of its range.  It is 
often found in moist open forests, clearings, riparian 
areas, along roadsides and fence lines, on hillsides and in 
canyons.  It also occupies drier forests, chaparral and 
coastal scrub habitats. Indian plum grows on most soil 
textures but not on sites that are saturated in winter or 
especially shady.  
  
Establishment  
Indian plum seed is easily gathered by hand-stripping fruit 
in May to July depending on location. Ten pounds of 
fresh fruit will yield approximately 2.5 lb. of seed.  
Macerate the fruit in a blender and rinse the seed over a 
screen to remove the pulp prior to storage under cool (33-
38 degrees F) and dry conditions.  Seeds of Indian plum 
are larger toward the southern extent of its range with 
about 1800 seeds per pound in California versus more 
than 4000 in Washington.  Viability is usually high with 
90+% germination after two to four months of moist 
chilling (stratification).  Bottom heat may aid 
germination, which will occur in about a week.  Although 
Indian plum is usually propagated by seed, dormant 
season digging of root suckers or seedlings, layering, and 
cuttings can also be effective.  Hardwood cuttings of 
vigorous 1-yr old wood collected early in winter and 
treated with rooting hormone often perform well.  Success 
with softwood and semi-hard wood cuttings has also been 
reported.  New plants can be obtained by layering in the 
spring with separation from the parent plants during the 
following dormant season.  
 
Management  
Indian plum is shallow rooted and will benefit from 
occasional irrigation during the first year or two of 
establishment.  For riparian conservation sites, plant 
Indian plum 4-6 feet apart in the overbank or transition 
zones.  Greater spacing is recommended for landscape

Alternative Names 
Common Alternate Name: Common Sundrops 
Uses 
Conservation. Narrowleaf evening primrose is a 
beautiful, native perennial and colonizing wildflower 
which can be used for meadows, native plant landscaping 
and to attract a multitude of wildlife.  It is a good 
component of a pollinator seed mixture with shorter 
stature native grasses and wildflowers together.  It grows 
easily in sunny, well drained, moderately fertile locations.  
It can tolerate very dry (xeric) conditions, however 
readily spreads and may become weedy in some 
situations.    
 
Wildlife: The flowers are pollinated by bees, skippers and 
butterflies.  A sweat bee (Lasioglossum oenotherae) is a 
specialist pollinator of many different species of 
narrowleaf evening primrose.  These insects suck nectar 
from the flowers and some bees also collect pollen for 
their larvae.  There are several insects that feed on 
evening primrose including pearly wood nymph (Eudryas 
unio), primrose moth (Schinia florida) and some 
momphid moths (Mompha spp.).  Hummingbirds visit the 
flowers for nectar and to eat insects.  The seeds are eaten

to a minor degree by the eastern goldfinch, mourning 
dove and the foliage is sometimes eaten by white-tailed 
deer.   
 
Ethnobotanical:  The Iroquois, Cherokee and Ojibwa 
Indians use this plant for a multitude of different uses.  It 
is used for weight loss, upset stomach, hemorrhoids and 
to treat bruises.  The seeds contain compounds which 
show promise treating breast cancer.  English visitors to 
this continent took the seeds back to England with them 
and the plant has become naturalized in northern Europe. 
Status 
This plant is listed as of special concern in Connecticut.  
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status.  
Weediness 
This plant may become weedy or invasive in some 
regions or habitats and may displace desirable vegetation 
if not properly managed.  Please consult with your local 
NRCS Field Office, Cooperative Extension Service 
office, state natural resource, or state agriculture 
department regarding its status and use.  Weed 
information is also available from the PLANTS Web site 
at http://plants.usda.gov.  Please consult the Related Web 
Sites on the Plant Profile for this species for further 
information. 
Description and Adaptation 
Narrowleaf evening primrose is a 16 – 36 inch tall, 
perennial wildflower.  The stems are slender, reddish and 
hairy.  The lance shaped leaves are 2 – 3 inches long and 
progress singly (alternate) up the stem.  The saucer 
shaped, four petaled, canary yellow flowers are 1 – 2 
inches across and mildly fragrant.  Contrary to its 
common name (evening primrose), the flowers open in 
the morning and last a few days.  Flowering occurs from 
the tops of its stems during the summer.  The seed capsule 
is shaped like a club at the top and tapers to a slender 
stalk, helping to distinguish this species from others.  The 
over wintering reddish-purple rosette is evergreen in the 
Mid-Atlantic and south eastern United States.  It can be 
found in meadows, fields, open woods and disturbed sites.

Narrowleaf Evening-Primrose distribution from USDA NRCS PLANTS 
Database 
For updated distribution, please consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
Establishment 
In native areas this plant acts as a primary colonizer, 
quickly germinating in disturbed soils and tends to be 
found in poor environments such as dunes and roadsides.  
After colonization it is often out competed by other 
species of plants  
Narrowleaf evening-primrose prefers full sun locations 
with well drained soils, which is extremely important 
during winter to prevent damage.  This plant spreads and 
will perform best in a well ventilated situation.  It is cold 
tolerant in zones 4 – 8 of the U.S. National  
Arboretum’s Plant Hardiness Zone Map.  
 
Propagation by Seeds: Seed may be sown in the spring 
or fall and will germinate in one to three weeks at 70 
degrees Fahrenheit.   
Propagation by Cuttings/Division:  Cuttings can be 
easily rooted from tip cuttings taken in spring or late 
summer.  Due to its fibrous root system, established 
plants can be easily divided in the early fall or spring.   
Pests and Potential Problems 
This plant is susceptible to leaf spots and rust, neither of 
which is a very serious problem.   
Environmental Concerns 
Narrowleaf evening-primrose may be an aggressive 
growing plant in certain locations, tripling is size every 
season.    
Control 
A non-selective systemic herbicide containing glyphosate 
will effectively control the plant.  Please contact your 
local agricultural extension specialist or county weed 
specialist to learn what works best in your area and how 
to use it safely.  Always read label and safety instructions 
for each control method.  Trade names and control 
measures appear in this document only to provide specific 
information.  USDA NRCS does not guarantee or 
warranty the products and control methods named, and 
other products may be equally effective. 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials  
The cultivar `Fyrveken’ (‘Fireworks’) is about 18 inches 
tall with red stems and buds that open to bright yellow 
flowers.  ‘Lady Brookborough’ has more but smaller 
flowers.  ‘Yellow River’ has many medium sized flowers 
and mahogany leaves in the autumn.  ‘Hoheslicht’ 
(‘Highlight’) is only about 12 inches tall with yellow 
flowers.  Oenothera fruticosa subsp. glauca 
‘Sonnenwende’ (‘Solstice’) is 18 – 24 inches tall has pink 
buds with large yellow flowers.   
The plant may have originated in Mexico and Central 
America from which it spread to North and South 
America.  Some species are now naturalized in Europe 
and Asia.

broad, flat-topped inflorescence (cluster of flowers).  
The plant is a member of the Asteraceae, or aster 
family. It attains a height of over one meter.  It 
flowers during the fall.  The goldenrod flowers are 
like miniature asters and are all yellow.  They are 
arranged in an inflorescence which is about 15 cm 
across and flat across the top.  The leaves of 
goldenrod are stiff, rough textured and are alternately 
arranged on the stem.  The leaves on the lower part of 
the plant are oblong and have short petioles.  The 
upper leaves are lance-shaped and stalkless. there are 
also longer basal leaves that overwinter. 
Stiff goldenrod is more palatable than other members 
of the goldenrod group but is still infrequently 
grazed.  It behaves in a prairie as an invader, i.e. it 
tends to come into pastures in greater amount when 
the prairie has been weakened by grazing.

drained soils, but will perform well on droughty, very 
sandy sites.  When established on sand dunes it will 
only survive where other species have initially 
stabilized the location.  It will tolerate moderate 
saline overspray, and pH as low as 5.0.  It does not 
tolerate large deposits of sand. Coastal panicgrass is 
useful in warm season grass mixtures on sand and 
gravel pits.  There the good seedling vigor helps with 
initial stand establishment.  Inland and north of 
Massachusetts it will winterkill, but not before 
helping during the seeding years.

Plant Profile page for this species on the PLANTS 
Website.

Alternate Names 
beaked panicum, spreading panicum  
Uses 
Livestock: 
Beaked panicgrass is grazed by cattle and is of good value 
for grazing.  
 
Wildlife: 
Deer will graze beaked panicgrass. The seed are eaten by 
upland birds and some waterfowl.  
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g. threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values).  
 
Description and Adaptation  
Beaked panicgrass is a native, warm season perennial and 
a member of the grass family (Poaceae). This grass grows 
from 2 to 4 feet tall (60 to 120 cm). The seedhead 
(inflorescence) is an open panicle 6 to 14 inches long (15 
to 35 cm) and each spikelet ¼” to 1/8” long. The second 
glume is curved at the end like a bird’s beak, hence the 
common name.  
 
Vegetative growth begins in February and is usually 
completed by May or June. Seed is ready for harvest in 
September. Beaked panicgrass is a prolific seed producer.  
 
Plant Fact Sheet
Beaked panicgrass occurs from New York to Florida west 
to Kansas and Texas. In Texas, it is found in the eastern 
half of the state. This plant prefers moist to wet soils. This 
plant is found growing in bottomland freshwater marshes 
and swamps on sandy soils. Beaked panicgrass grows best 
under 30 to 35 percent shade. The plants form large 
clumps as they spread from short rhizomes.  
 
 
Melinda Brakie, East Texas Plant Materials Center  
Known Distribution 
Please consult the PLANTS web site for the current 
distribution of this species. 
  
Establishment 
Beaked panicgrass reproduces from seeds, tillers, and 
rhizomes. The seeds should be planted in the fall or early 
winter. If planting in the spring, treatment to overcome 
seed dormancy is necessary for satisfactory stand 
establishment. A common method for increasing seed 
germination is a cold/moist stratification treatment.  
 
Plant vegetative material on three foot centers in the 
spring.  
 
Management 
Beaked panicgrass is grazed by cattle and horses. This 
plant contributes small quantities of forage since it is 
rarely abundant except on small areas. Close grazing 
causes the plant’s basal tufts to spread widely and the 
leaves form a dense cover over small areas. 
 
Pests and Potential Problems  
Check with your local extension service for recommended 
herbicides if control is needed.   
Environmental Concerns  
Beaked panicgrass has no known pests or problems.

UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_='Description and Adaptation 
Golden Ragwort is a member of the Aster family 
(Asteraceae).  It is a somewhat weedy, short lived, 
perennial forb growing from 6 inches to 2 feet tall.   
The two very different kinds of leaves are highly 
distinctive.  The blades of the basal leaves are 2 
inches long and 2 inches across. they are cordate-
orbicular in shape.  The slender petioles of the basal 
leaves are 2 inches long.  A flower stalk develops 
from the center of each rosette.  Along this stalk, 
there are usually 2 – 3 alternate leaves.  These leaves 
are smaller in size than the basal leaves and pinnatifid 
in shape.  Both the alternate leaves and the stalk are 
hairless.  The stalk ends in a flat-headed panicle of 
yellow flowers.  The blooming period occurs early 
spring (March – April) and lasts about 3 weeks.  Each 
daisy-like flower is 1 inch across. in the center there 
are numerous golden yellow disk florets, which are 
surrounded by 6-16 yellow ray florets.  Both the disk 
and ray florets are fertile.  Each floret is replaced by a 
purple bullet shaped achene which is distributed by 
the wind.  The short rootstock has spreading fibrous 
roots and it produces rhizomes (and sometimes 
stolons).   
 
Golden Ragwort is a carefree plant which prefers full 
sun to light shade in wet to moist soils with ample 
organic matter to retain moisture.  Plants grown in 
full sun require more moisture than plants growing in 
shade.  It often forms colonies of plants in favorable 
habitats.   
 
Distribution:  This species is very widely distributed 
in the eastern North America in USDA hardiness 
zones 3 - 9.  Habitats include wet deciduous woods, 
meadows, banks of rivers, streams and lakes, slopes 
of rocky ravines, and roadsides.

Grass Family (Poaceae).  Kleingrass is a warm-
season perennial bunchgrass introduced from Africa.  
Introductions were made as early as 1942, but it was 
not until the 1950’s that desirable types were 
introduced and evaluated.  It is fine-stemmed and 
leafy at maturity which culms are erect, 50-120 
centimeters (20-47 inches) tall, from a knotty base.  
Leave sheaths glabrous or with papillose based hairs 
and blades 2.5 millimeters (1/16 to 3/16 inches) wide, 
with scattered papillose based hairs on margins.  
Panicle is 7 to 20 centimeters (2 ¾ to 8 inches) long, 
spikelets on short pedicels.  Spikelets are glabrous, 
2.6 to 3.1 millimeters (about 1/8 inch) long with 2 
florets which lower floret staminate, with long palea 
and upper floret fertile, glabrous, shiny, and hard, 
with acute apex.  It is the same genus as switchgrass 
and blue panicum and bears a slight grass 
appearance.  Kleingrass is quite variable in its 
makeup, sometimes prostrate but mostly erect.  
Kleingrass spreads by tillers or short rhizomes, and 
will root at the nodes when the stems contact with 
wet soils. 
 
Kleingrass is adapted to a wide range of heavy soils 
and dry conditions in central Texas and on wet soils 
in the Gulf coast.  In the Rio Grande Plains it does 
well on shallow sites, deep sandy soils and medium 
textured soils.  Kleingrass grows in the southern 
United States (Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, 
California, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, 
Georgia, Florida and South Carolina) as well as 
Mexico.  The plant is moderate salinity tolerant.  It 
produces good forage production with 46 to 76 
centimeters (18 to 30 inches) rainfall or under 
irrigation, but is a poor cold tolerant plant.  Cures for 
good winter forage in drier regions.

Uses 
Wildlife: Knotgrass is grazed by deer and other mammals.  
It provides a substantial source of food for ducks as well.  
Knotgrass also serves as a larval host to the sunrise 
skipper, Adopaeoides prittwitzi.  
 
Livestock:  Knotgrass can provide valuable forage for 
livestock, especially in areas of high salinity.  It can be 
used for hay, but is not suitable for use in silage. 
 
Erosion:  Knotgrass can tolerate a waterlogged 
environment which allows it to be used in the restoration 
of wetlands, marshes, beaches, and stream banks.

Weediness 
This plant may become weedy or invasive in some 
regions or habitats and may displace desirable vegetation 
if not properly managed.  Please consult with your local 
NRCS Field Office, Cooperative Extension Service 
office, state natural resource, or state agriculture 
department regarding its status and use.  Weed

Description 
Knotgrass is a warm season, perennial grass that grows in 
clumps or creeping along the soil surface.  New growth 
begins in March and will remain green until the first frost.  
Stems grow along the soil and range from 6-72 inches in 
length.  At each node, roots are sent downward, and 
flowering stems emerge up to 18 inches tall.  Nodes on 
the creeping stems are often pubescent whereas the nodes 
on the mat-forming stems are glabrous.  Blades are flat 
and taper to an enrolled apex.  They are 2-6 inches long 
and about one inch wide.  Flowers from knotgrass range 
in color from usually pink to red, green, or dull white.  
They are about 1/8 inch long and grow in clusters of two 
to three per stem.  Seed have an oval shape with one end 
tapered to a point.  They have a yellowish light color and 
averages about 1/10 inch long. 
 
Adaptation 
Knotgrass is found in both wet and well-drained areas.  
Common locations to find knotgrass are meadows, 
marshes, and ditches, but it can also be found growing in 
cultivated and disturbed areas.  Knotgrass is also adapted 
to areas with high salinity.

Knotgrass distribution from USDA-NRCS PLANTS Database 
 
For updated distribution, please consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
 
Establishment 
Knotgrass reproduces from rhizomes, stolons, and seeds.  
It can be easily established by sowing stolons in damp 
holes.  It can also be planted directly into water saturated 
sites, which would allow it to remain green throughout the 
year.  Knotgrass may flower throughout the year.  The 
seed may be gathered. however, seed dormancy must 
break before they germinate.  The seed yields the highest 
germination when temperatures are between 82 to 95° F.  
Scarifying seed with acid will also increase germination.  
It is not recommended to mix knotgrass with cool season 
grasses in seed mixtures.  The cool season grasses will 
dominate the warm season grasses that begin growth later 
in the year.   
 
Management 
Knotgrass can be grazed, but it is recommended to lightly 
graze and give 2 ½ to 3 months rest because the stolons 
are easily uprooted.  Consult your local NRCS Field 
Office for assistance with planning and applying 
prescribed grazing.  Tilling knotgrass on dry surfaces will 
increase the number of stolons rooting into the soil and 
encourage a denser sod.  Proper management is needed to 
prevent knotgrass from blocking irrigation ditches and 
other waterways.  Knotgrass will survive burnings as long 
as water is above the soil surface to protect the rhizomes.  
Consult your local NRCS Field Office for assistance with 
planning and applying prescribed burning.

Adaptation 
Havard panicum grows in arroyos and sand hills of 
western Texas, southern New Mexico and northern 
Mexico (Hitchcock 1935). This grass, like giant 
sandreed (Calamovilfa gigantea), and blowout grass 
(Redfieldia flexuosa) are among the first native 
species to show up as stabilizers on deep, active, sand 
dune areas.  Giant sandreed and blowout grass are 
common over a wide section of the southern United 
States, but Havard panicum is found only in Texas, 
southern New Mexico, and northern Mexico, in 
arroyos and on the extensive dune areas.  It is 
prevalent in Ward, Crane, Winkler, Ector, and 
Andrews Counties of western Texas.     
' WHERE symbol='paha2';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD fs_ TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_='Establishment 
Havard panicum is established from seed in the 
spring by either broadcasting on the sand dunes or 
sowing with a small grass drill at a depth of ¼ inch 
on flatter surface dune areas.  Applying a thin layer 
of hay mulch or an erosion control type mat after 
seeding will retain moisture when it rains to aid in the 
seed germination.   
 
An alternative is to propagate Havard panicum from 
rhizomes, harvested during the previous year, in the 
greenhouse in 1 gallon pots and transplant these 
rhizomes in the spring to sandy sites.  Irrigation of 
these sandy sites would be necessary during the first 
growing season.  
 
' WHERE symbol='paha2';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD fs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_Management=' 
Havard panicum is valuable for controlling erosion 
on deep sands subject to severe wind erosion.   
   
When used for pasture the grazing value of the 
havard panicum can be fair at early vegetative stages, 
before the inflorescence stage, when plants are fresh 
with new growth.  Do not overgraze and leave 
enough plant material for regrowth.  Begin grazing 
when plants reaches a height of 12 inches. plants 
should not be grazed below a stubble height of 6 to 8 
inches.  At the James E. “Bud” Smith Plant Materials 
Center near Knox City, Texas, the Havard panicum 
grown for seed production is swathed and baled for 
hay, after the seeds are harvested.

type of additional coverage such as culti-packing or light 
dragging will be beneficial to ensure good seed to soil 
contact.  Seed should be planted 1/8 to 1/4 inch deep.  It is 
better to plant too shallow than too deep.   
 
Soil analysis should be performed prior to planting to

Description and Adaptation 
Description: 
Maidencane is a warm season, rhizomatous, 
perennial, grass that grows from 2 to 5 feet in height.  
Its leaves are alternate with over lapping sheaths that 
grasp the stem and extend at approximately 35 degree 
angles.  Maidencane is smooth and hairless with a 
membranous ligule.  It typically spreads via rhizomes 
and produces few seed heads.  Seed heads are very 
delicate in appearance, and are often sterile.  
Vegetative stems will greatly outnumber reproductive 
stems. 
  
Adaptation: 
Maidencane will tolerate a wide array of soil textures 
and prefers a near neutral pH.  It will tolerate 
anaerobic conditions, and is one of the dominate 
species found in the floating marshes of Louisiana.  It 
will not tolerate salt, and is absent in brackish areas.  
Maidencane is fire tolerant, as long as the rhizomes 
and roots are moist, and can withstand temperatures 
down to -3 degrees Fahrenheit.   
   
Distribution: 
Maidencane is widespread throughout the 
Southeastern seaboard from Texas to New Jersey, 
and as far inland as Tennessee.  It is commonly

Forage: 
Maidencane can be an important forage grass in the 
coastal zone of the southeastern Untied States, and is 
very palatable to livestock.  It is highly digestible, 
with a TDN of 50% and crude protein levels of 
10.5% from June to September.  This decreases to 
34% TDN and 7.4% crude protein during winter 
months.  Maidencane is very prolific. often forming 
monotypic stands, and can produce 4-5 tons of high 
quality forage per acre. 
 
Wildlife: 
Palatability among browse animals is rated as fair.  
Maidencane provides excellent habitat and cover for 
a wide array of mammals, reptiles, amphibians, birds, 
and fish.  Maidencane marshes in Florida are reported 
to be extensively used by whitetail deer and the 
endangered Florida Panther.    
 
Conservation: 
Maidencane is an excellent plant for use in shoreline 
stabilization in fresh water locations.  It has a rapid 
growth rate, and forms dense stand that extend from

on the Plant Profile for this species for further 
information. 
 
Description 
Wright pavonia is a native, upright, shrubby, perennial, 
warm-season forb that can grow 2-4 feet tall.  The flowers 
are solitary on slender stems with five petals.  They have 
a rose-red to pink color and will bloom from June through 
the fall time of the year.  Its leaves are alternate with 
coarsely toothed or lobed margins.  The leaves grow from 
one to two and a half inches long.  Seed can be easily 
collected from mature flowers. 
 
Adaptation 
Wright pavonia is found in Texas from the Edwards 
plateau south to the Rio Grande Plains and Trans-Pecos 
area.  It is adapted to a wide range of soil types, but 
performs best on sandy to medium textured soils that are 
well-drained.

six seedlings per square foot.  When planting this as a 
component of a seed mixture, the seeding rate should be 
adjusted to the desired percent of the mix.  Soil samples 
should be taken before planting to determine the amount 
of fertilizer needed to bring the fertility level up to a 
medium range. 
 
Management 
Wright pavonia is used as a component in seed mixtures 
for ranges and pastures.  Grazing should not be permitted 
the  first  year  in  order  to  allow  plants  to  establish  strong 
root  systems.    Although  Wright  pavonia  reseeds  itself 
readily, proper management is required to ensure the plant 
is not overgrazed or over utilized by livestock or wildlife.

Materials Center 
Hitchcock, A.S. 1950 
Manual of the Grasses of the U.S. 
Alternate Names 
Paspalum denticulatum, longtom 
Uses 
Forage:  Longtom paspalum (Paspalum lividum) is 
valuable as a native range plant to grazing animals. 
Hatch, Schuster, and Drawe (1999) note that longtom 
paspalum is one of the top four species in cattle diets 
on mid-successional rangelands along the central 
Texas Gulf Coast.   
Erosion:  It can also be used as a ground cover for 
erosion control. 
Wildlife:  The seeds of longtom paspalum can 
provide food for birds. 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s 
current status (e.g. threatened or endangered species, 
state noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
Description 
Longtom paspalum is a native, warm-season, 
stoloniferous perennial.  It is a member of the 
Paniceae tribe of the grass family Poaceae.  It grows 
to 2-3 feet in height. Longtom paspalum is an 
apomitic species, which means it produces seed 
without fertilization.  There is no known commercial 
variety of longtom paspalum. 
Adaptation and Distribution 
Longtom paspalum is native along the Gulf of 
Mexico from  Florida and Alabama to Texas, through 
Eastern Mexico, south to Argentina, and in the 
Carribean Islands. 
be found in the southeast region, and in the coastal 
part of the Rio Grande Plains.  It grows in low-lying 
areas, wet savannahs, in swamps, along streambanks, 
and in ditches.  Longtom paspalum prefers moist to 
semi-wet conditions and tight clay loam soils.  It 
appears to be sensitve to frost.

For a current distribution map, please consult the 
Plant Profile page for this species on the PLANTS 
Web site. 
Establishment 
Longtom paspalum can be grown from seed, from 
cuttings, or from vegetative clumps.  It appears to 
germinate best at temperatures between 20º-30º C. 
Germination tests done with longtom paspalum seed 
by the Texas Department of Agriculture Laboratory 
at Giddings, Texas yielded germination averages 
ranging from 15%-56% for different harvest years. 
Seed production and seed fertility of longtom 
paspalum appears to be highly dependent on the 
amount of moisture the plants receive during the 
growing season.  In drier years, seed production and 
seed fertility decrease sharply in non-irrigated plants.  
Even under good irrigation, seed yields have been 
low (2-5 lbs. per acre) at the Plant Materials Center.  
There are approximately 567,500 seeds/ pound of 
longtom paspaulm.   
Plant Materials Center staff has had the best success

approximately 90% survival.  Its stolons make this 
grass well adapted to this method of reproduction.  
Larger vegetative clumps of longtom paspalum can 
also be moved to new sites.  Once established, the 
plants will spread themselves via many runners. 
Adequate irrigation must be provided for cuttings or 
clumps to be transplanted successfully. 
Management 
For seed production purposes, longtom paspalum 
must be irrigated when rainfall totals are low or else 
seed production, fill, and fertility will be greatly 
reduced.  Regular fertilization of longtom paspalum 
is also necessary, as it appears to be sensitive to iron 
deficient soils. 
Pests and Potential Problems 
For Texas, this grass is best suited to southern coastal 
areas where mesic conditions dominate, and the 
chance of frost is low.  This grass prefers “wet feet” 
and is not exceedingly drought tolerant.  Under 
drought conditions, it does not compete well with 
bermuda grass.  Weed control and iron deficiency can 
also be a problem.

Uses 
Erosion control: Bahiagrass is used for the NRCS 
conservation practices Grassed Waterway and Critical 
Area Planting.  It is planted on critical areas such pond 
banks, levees, and gullies in agricultural fields.  
Turf: This grass is suitable for low-maintenance lawns 
and public areas, and is recommended for infertile soils 
and heavy traffic areas.  It is more shade tolerant than 
bermudagrass.   
 
 
Livestock: Bahiagrass, with proper management, provides 
fair to good pasture and hay, and can be used in woodland 
pasture systems (silvopasture).  Forage quality depends on 
soil fertility and grass stage of growth.  Bahiagrass hay is 
leafy, but difficult to make because of bahiagrass’ 
prostrate growth habit. 
 
Caution: Seed heads of the cultivar ‘Argentine’ are often 
infected by ergot (Claviceps paspali).  Pregnant mares can 
experience abortion problems if they eat large quantities 
of infected seed heads.  Also, ingestion of infected seeds 
can produce toxic effects in cattle.  The occurrence of 
toxic seed heads can be managed through mowing or by 
keeping pregnant horses confined. 
 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
Wildlife: Bahiagrass can be grown with other species that 
are more beneficial for wildlife.  Deer, birds and small 
mammals will utilize the plant—especially the seeds—for 
food.

Weediness  
This plant may become weedy or invasive in some 
regions or habitats and may displace desirable vegetation 
if not properly managed.  Please consult with your local 
NRCS Field Office, Cooperative Extension Service 
office, or state natural resource or agriculture department 
regarding its status and use.  Weed information is also

Please consult the Related Web Sites on this species’ 
Plant Profile for further information. 
 
Description and Adaptation 
Bahiagrass is a deep-rooted perennial adapted to a wide 
range of soils.  It is low-growing and spreads with stolons 
and stout, scaly rhizomes.  Stolons are pressed firmly to 
the ground, have short internodes, and root freely from 
the nodes forming a dense sod.  Bahiagrass is a prolific 
seed-producing plant.  The flat, tough-textured leaves are 
usually hairless. with blades 1/8-1/4 inch wide and 8-20 
inches in length.  Leaves are flat, folded, and in-rolled, 
tapering to a fine point.  Stems usually reach 8-30 inches 
tall.  The seed head usually consists of a dual racemes 
with each attached to the top of a slender stem.  
Occasionally there may be a third seed head present 
below the terminal ones.  
 
Bahiagrass is most productive on sandy soils with a pH of 
5.5 to 6.5.  It is more productive on drought prone, sandy 
soils with relative low fertility than other forages.  
 
Distribution: Bahiagrass is a native to South America.  Its 
current range in Central and South America extends from 
Mexico to northern Argentina and the West Indies.  It was 
introduced to the southeastern United States primarily for 
forage, and erosion control and has since become 
naturalized.  It is adapted from east Texas to the Carolinas 
to as far north as northern Arkansas.  Please consult the

Establishment 
Bahiagrass can be established from seed or sod.  It will 
grow on soils too poorly-drained for bermudagrass.  The 
best time to establish bahiagrass is during the spring or 
early summer months when adequate moisture is 
available.  Later plantings in the summer have severe 
competition from weeds.  Fall plantings may be used in 
southern areas where cold temperatures are not a problem.  
Proper site preparation before planting is critical to ensure 
successful establishment.  Bahiagrass should not be 
planted on high-pH soils (&gt. 6.5).  For pasture or hay, drill 
15 pounds pure live seed (PLS) per acre at 1/4 inch depth 
or less.  For turf, use 5-10 pounds PLS per 1000 square 
feet.  Good seed to soil contact is essential for bahiagrass 
to germinate.  Bahiagrass seed is slow to germinate and 
may take several months to fully establish.  Grazing is not 
recommended during establishment because seedlings 
will be trampled and damaged.  Crabgrass (Digitaria spp.) 
may become a problem on newly seeded fields.  Mowing 
may be necessary to prevent the crabgrass from shading 
the bahiagrass seedlings. 
 
Management 
Bahiagrass is a relatively low maintenance grass with 
fewer disease and insect problems than some of the other 
introduced warm season grasses.  Its ability to survive 
periods of drought makes it adaptable for southern 
pastures.  Bahiagrass will persist in pastures with a low 
level of management.  Though it responds to fertilizer 
applications, it does not respond to the high rates 
commonly used on improved bermudagrass.  Bahiagrass 
is well adapted to sandy soils due to its tolerance of 
drought and low soil fertility.  Bahiagrass forage is 
slightly lower in quality than bermudagrass.  Close 
grazing stimulates new growth and improves forage 
quality. 
 
The dense, compact sod of bahiagrass inhibits the growth 
of intercropped legumes.  However, white clover 
(Trifolium repens) and winter annuals such as crimson 
clover (T. incarnatum) and arrowleaf clover (T. 
vesiculosum
pastures and hayfields.  
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
 spp.) have been known to 
Mole crickets (Scapteriscus
cause problems in established stands. The only serious 
disease of bahiagrass is dollar spot fungus (Sclerotinia 
homoeocarpa F.T. Benn). 
 
Environmental Concerns 
Bahiagrass can become a pest in bermudagrass hay fields 
and home lawns.  Use caution when moving livestock that 
have grazed bahiagrass pastures.  Undigested seeds can be 
transported and deposited in other fields. 
 
Control  
Please contact your local agricultural extension specialist 
or county weed specialist to learn what works best in your 
) can be established and grown in bahiagrass 
 
 
area and how to use it safely.  Always read label and 
safety instructions for each control method.  
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
Common bahiagrass is a coarse-textured, light-colored 
bahiagrass.  It has an open and sparse growth habit and is 
very susceptible to cold temperatures.  
 
‘Argentine’ bahiagrass forms a relatively dense sod and 
has a dark green color, making it acceptable for lawn use.  
It has good insect and disease resistance.  ‘Argentine’ 
winterkills more readily than ‘Pensacola’.   
 
‘Pensacola’ bahiagrass was released in 1944 by the 
Georgia Soil Conservation Service and the Florida 
Agriculture Experiment Station (AES).  It is the most 
widely grown variety of bahiagrass.  It has an extensive 
root system giving it excellent drought tolerance.  It is 
tolerant to hot or cold temperatures.  It produces an 
abundance of seed heads which limits its desirability for 
use as a lawn grass. 
 
‘Paraguay’ is a short, course, narrow-leaved cultivar that 
produces less forage than ‘Pensacola’.  
 
‘Paraguay 22’ is a single selection, non-released variety 
chosen for its improved cold hardiness over the Paraguay 
types. Both types have lower cold hardiness than 
‘Pensacola’.  
 
‘Tifton 9’ was released in 1987 by the University of 
Georgia and USDA-Agriculture Research Service (ARS) 
as an improved selection from the ‘Pensacola’ variety.  It 
was developed for improved forage characteristics.  It has 
more vigorous seedlings, longer leaves, and improved 
digestibility over Pensacola’.   
 
‘TifQuik’ was developed to have quick seed germination 
and reduced hard seed.  The variety also exhibits quick 
growth, excellent seedling vigor, and higher forage yields 
than ‘Tifton 9’.  
 
‘UF-Riata’ was developed for south Florida by the 
University of Florida.  This variety was selected for 
improved cold tolerance over ‘Pensacola’ or ‘Argentine’. 
 
‘Wilmington’ is the most cold-hardy bahiagrass variety 
known.  Released in 1971 by Mississippi AES and NRCS, 
it has narrow leaves of medium size, but is less productive 
than ‘Pensacola’ and ‘Paraguay’.

Description 
Virginia creeper is a native, woody, deciduous vine 
that climbs to a height of 60 feet on trees, poles or 
other structures, or forms a blanket of foliage up to 
12 inches high along the ground.  Stems are orange 
brown, finely hairy with branched tendrils that end in 
adhesive discs.  The leaves are alternate and 
compound with 5, or rarely 3, leaflets that turn bright 
red in autumn.  The leaflets are pointed, coarse-
toothed and grow to 6 inches long.  Inconspicuous 
green flowers borne in clusters during the spring are 
followed by a cluster of ¼-inch bluish black berries.  
There are 12,000 to 19,000 seeds per pound. 
Adaptation and Distribution 
Virginia creeper is found throughout the eastern half 
of the United States.  It prefers moist, well-drained 
soils but will grow in drier soils and conditions 
including coastal dune areas.  Virginia creeper is 
fairly shade tolerant, however it is often found along 
more open clearing borders, fencerows and 
streambanks.  It is also salt tolerant. 
 
For a current distribution map, please consult the 
Plant Profile page for this species on the PLANTS 
Website. 
 
Establishment 
Seeds should be drilled 3/8 inches deep in the fall or, 
preferably, in the spring after stratification.  Virginia 
creeper can also be propagated from hardwood 
cuttings or layering.  Literature suggests germination 
rates vary between 20 and 50% with optimum density 
for erosion protection at 10 plants per square foot.  
For restoration, partial cover, and wildlife plantings, 
it is often planted other species at densities of 1 plant 
or less per square foot. 
Management 
As Virginia creeper will grow in low fertility and 
droughty conditions maintenance for this species is 
minimal.

Uses 
Erosion Control: Although Virginia creeper has a 
rather open canopy structure, with its energetic 
growth and aboveground rooting and sprouting habits 
this species can be useful groundcover for erosion 
control and watershed protection, particularly in 
shaded areas.  
Restoration: Virginia creeper is a native component 
of eastern climax forests. 
Wildlife: Virginia creeper provides cover for many 
small birds and mammals.  Songbirds are the 
principle consumers of the fruit, however deer, 
gamebirds and small mammals will also feed on 
them.  Cattle and deer will sometimes browse on the 
foliage. 
Other: Virginia creeper is often cultivated as an 
ornamental because of its attractive foliage.  The bark 
has been used in domestic medicines as a tonic, 
expectorant and remedy for dropsy.

Paspalum setaceum var. setaceum (previously P. 
debile) is identified by some plant authorities as thin 
paspalum.  Others recognize the varieties, but 
consider thin paspalum to be Paspalum setaceum, a 
separate entity from the other varieties.  Still others 
see thin paspalum as the whole Paspalum setaceum 
complex, and do not recognize the individual 
varieties at all. The varieties will be discussed herein 
because the most recent authority recognizes them. 
 The variety setaceum (previously P. debile, which 
Gould (1975) calls thin paspalum) can be 
differentiated from the other varieties as having 
narrower leaf blades, shorter spikelets, and gray-
green herbage. 
The variety stramineum (previously P. stramineum) 
is distinguished from the other varieties by narrower 
leaf blades and yellow-green foliage. 
The variety muhlenbergii (previously P. 
muhlenbergii and P. pubescens) has light to dark 
green, pilose leaf blades and is distinguished by a 
conspicuous midvein on the lower floret. 
Finally, the variety ciliatifolium (previously P. 
ciliatifolium and P. propinquum) is recognized by its 
glabrous dark green to purplish herbage.  It is 
commonly called fringeleaf paspalum.   
It is important to note that populations of widely 
variable, but intergrading plant types are included in 
the Paspalum setaceum complex.

lived, cool season species that has coarse blue- green 
leaves with prominent veins.  Because of this bluish 
appearance it has sometimes been called bluestem 
wheatgrass or bluejoint.  It is a sod former with very 
strong, spreading rhizomes.  Stems arise singly or in 
clusters of a few and reach heights of 1 to 3 feet.  The 
sheaths are hairy and the purplish auricles typically 
clasp the stem.  The seed spike is erect and about 2 to 
6 inches long.

content and is most common in the 10 to 14 inch 
annual precipitation zones.  Above 20 inches per year 
it behaves as an increaser on rangelands, below 20

Western wheatgrass tolerates saline and saline-sodic 
soils, poor drainage and moderately severe drought.  
It will tolerate spring flooding, high water tables, and 
considerable silt deposition.  It is very cold hardy and 
can grow in partial shade.  It is grazing resistant and 
can survive fires if in the dormant stage. recovery 
from fire, however, is slow. 
 
Western wheatgrass grows in association with many

Western wheatgrass is moderately palatable to elk 
and cattle all year although this quality diminishes in 
late summer.  It is palatable to deer only in spring.  It  
is preferred by cattle more than by sheep.  It can be 
grazed if 50 to 60 percent of the annual growth is 
allowed to remain (3 or 4 inch stubble).  Rest rotation 
of western wheatgrass is advised.  In areas where it is 
dense, it makes an excellent hay as well as pasture.

Contributed by:  USDA NRCS East Texas Plant 
Materials Center  
 
Seashore paspalum forms dense sod if mowed to a 
one inch height and makes an attractive turf grass.  It 
will withstand traffic well, and has been successfully 
used on golf courses.  Some varieties have a two 
toned appearance to their leaf surfaces which create 
an attractive striped effect when mowed.  Because of 
its salt tolerance, this species can be used 
successfully in areas with saline soils or groundwater.    
  
Conservation: 
Seashore paspalum makes an excellent shoreline 
protector.  It spreads rapidly, forming dense stands 
that anchor soil particles and dissipate wave energy.  
It is easy to establish, and can withstand moderately 
high salinity and brief inundation.  It can also uptake 
heavy metals, and is a candidate as a buffer or filter 
strip plant for Phytoremediation of such substances.

Description 
Seashore paspalum is a native, low growing, warm 
season, perennial grass that reaches approximately 20 
inches in height.  It is highly stoloniferous and 
rhizomatous, similar to bermudagrass, Cynodon 
dactylon, and will tack down at the nodes forming a 
dense turf.  Seed heads are similar to other 
paspalums, and typically form a fork with 2 racemes.  
The leaves are fine, approximately 2mm in width, 
sharply pointed with large sheaths, a small, scale-like 
ligule, and have a deep blue-green color.  
 
Adaptation 
Seashore paspalum favors medium to fine textured 
soils with a pH between 6 and 8.  It will not tolerate 
shade, drought, or freezing.  It prefers moist to 
saturated sites and can withstand brief inundations. 
Prolonged flooding is detrimental.  It is salt tolerant, 
with some varieties able to tolerate irrigation from 
sea water. 
 
Distribution 
Seashore paspalum is distributed across the 
southeastern seaboard from Texas to North Carolina.  
It is commonly associated with brackish and 
freshwater wetlands along the gulf and Atlantic

biomass be removed via grazing or cutting.  It is 
typically grazed in the summer and early fall, and has 
moderate palatability.   
 
Wildlife: 
Due to its low growth form, turf formation, and low 
palatability among browse animals, seashore 
paspalum is not a highly significant wildlife plant.

Uses 
Whiplash pappusgrass is recommended for upland 
wildlife, highway rights-of-ways, and range plantings. 
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
 
Description and Adaptation 
Whiplash pappusgrass is a native, perennial bunchgrass.  
Stems are 30-80 (sometimes 100) cm. tall, stiffly erect or 
somewhat jointed near the base, and smooth. Sheaths 
have a tuft of long hairs on either side of collar, and the 
hairs are deciduous with age. Ligule is a ring of short 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
hairs, but the base of blade immediately above the ligule 
has hairs 2-4 mm long. Leaf blades are flat or curled in 
when dry, 10-20 (sometimes 30) cm. long and 1.5-5 mm. 
broad. Panicles are narrow, tightly contracted, whitish or 
tawny, only rarely with a slight purple tinge, mostly 12-25 
cm. long. Spikelets with 1, rarely 2, perfect florets and 2 
reduced florets above. Chromosome number is reported to 
be 2n=40, or 60 (Reeder and Toolin 1989). Whiplash 
pappusgrass flowers from April through November 
(Gould 1975). Cleaned seed of whiplash pappusgrass 
contains approximately 436,250 seeds per pound. 
 
Whiplash pappusgrass can be found from Texas to 
Arizona and south into Northern Mexico.  It is also found 
in one county in New York and in one county in Maine.   
 
For updated distribution, please consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
 
Establishment 
Numerous seeding trials have documented good 
establishment of whiplash pappusgrass from seed in south 
Texas.  These plantings indicate good seed viability and 
persistence, an important characteristic for rangeland seed 
mix components in south Texas.  Plantings have shown 
that seeding in the fall season has been superior to spring 
plantings for establishment of pappusgrass in south Texas.  
 
The recommended seeding rate for pure stands of 
whiplash pappusgrass is 3 lbs. pure live seed per acre. 
Seed coatings (talc based) increase the flowability of seed 
through standard seed drills. Successful establishment has 
been obtained from both drill and broadcast plantings. 
 
Management 
Whiplash pappusgrass seed fields should be mowed or 
burned annually to promote vigorous growth. Deep soil 
tillage or frequent close cultivation is also recommended 
to promote seed production.  Consult your local 
Agriculture Extension office for herbicide 
recommendations.

Whiplash Pappusgrass Seedhead © Forrest Smith, South Texas Natives 
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Common pests of whiplash pappusgrass seed include fall 
armyworms (Spodoptera spp.), thrips (Thrips spp.), and 
rice stink bugs (Oebalus pugnax). Control of the pests 
may be necessary in order to produce seed crops in dry 
years under irrigation. 
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
Webb Germplasm whiplash pappusgrass was released by 
South Texas Natives and the E. “Kika” de la Garza Plant 
Materials Center in 2010 as a selected plant material class 
of certified seed (natural track).   
This release is comprised of three collections from three 
different south Texas counties (Smith et al. 2010).    
 
Pima Germplasm pima pappusgrass from Arizona was 
released in 2006 by the Tucson Plant Materials Center.  
Pima Germplasm is a composite of 16 accessions 
collected from native stands in southern Arizona.   No 
selection was made in order to maximize the genetic 
adaptability of the release.

evaluate several upland types of switchgrass for use 
as a biomass energy resource.  Selections of upland 
types of switchgrass have been evaluated by OSU for  
several years.  The development of hybrid progeny 
with substantial heterosis for increased biomass yield 
will ultimately result in improved hybrid cultivars for 
the Central and Southern United States.  The PMC is 
in the process of assessing several improved lines 
along with commercially available cultivars for dry-
matter potential and environmental adaptation.  
Results of this study may contribute to producers 
cashing in on a growing demand for renewable fuels 
and a decrease on our dependency on fossil fuels.

during late spring and early summer.  It provides 
good warm-season pasture and high quality hay for 
livestock. 
 
 
Erosion Control: Switchgrass is perhaps our most 
valuable native grass on a wide range of sites.  It is a 
valuable soil stabilization plant on strip-mine spoils, 
sand dunes, dikes, and other critical areas.  It is also 
suitable for low windbreak plantings in truck crop 
fields. 
Wildlife: Switchgrass provides excellent nesting and 
fall and winter cover for pheasants, quail, and rabbits.  
It holds up well in heavy snow (particularly ‘Shelter’ 
and ‘Kanlow’ cultivars) and is useful on shooting 
preserves.  The seeds provide food for pheasants, 
quail, turkeys, doves, and songbirds. 
 
Biofuel Source: Interest in switchgrass as a renewable 
biofuel resource has been increasing in recent years, 
primarily in the Southern United States.  The

Uses 
Pollinator habitat: Penstemon attenuatus is a source of 
pollen and nectar for a variety of bees, including honey 
bees and native bumble bees, as well as butterflies and 
moths. 
 
Rangeland diversification: This plant can be included in 
seeding mixtures to improve the diversity of rangelands. 
 
Ornamental: Penstemon attenuatus is very attractive and 
easy to manage as an ornamental in urban, water-saving 
landscapes.  It is hardy to USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 4.   
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
Description and Adaptation 
General:  Figwort family (Scrophulariaceae).  Penstemon 
attenuatus is a native, perennial forb that grows from a 
dense crown to a height of 10 to 90 cm (4 to 35 in).  
Leaves are dark green, opposite and have smooth edges, 
however the edges of P. attenuatus var. attenuatus leaves 
are often, at least in part, finely toothed.  Basal leaves 
have petioles, and are up to 4 cm (1.5 in) wide and 17 cm 
(7 in) long.  Stem leaves are smaller and mostly clasping.  
Flowers bloom in May and June, and can be blue to 
purple and pink, or pale yellow to nearly white.  The 
inflorescence consists of two whorls of flowers around the 
stem at each leaf axis.  Flowers have five long petals with 
translucent edges, and are 1 to 2 cm (3/8 to 3/4 in) long.  
The petals are fused to form a tube that is expanded 
toward the mouth and has two lips.  The lower lip and 
stamens are hairy.  Seeds are dark brown, round, and 
occur in capsules 3 to 6 mm (1/8 to 1/4 in) long.  Overall 
the appearance of P. attenuatus is very similar to other 
Penstemon species, causing difficulties in identification.  
 
Penstemon attenuatus is adapted to areas receiving 30 to 
64 cm (12 to 25 in) annual precipitation at elevations up 
to 3,000 m (5,000 ft).  It grows in well-drained, medium 
textured soils in dry meadows and on moist, open to 
wooded slopes in the mountains and foothills.

seeding method, the seeding rate should be doubled. 
 
To establish plants by seedlings, the seed should be 
planted in containers in October, left outside to stratify in 
cold and moist conditions for a minimum of 90 days, and 
moved into a greenhouse in January.  After growing in a 
greenhouse for three to four months, the plants should be 
hardened off in a cold frame for two to four weeks prior 
to transplanting to a prepared field site in the spring.  
Ideal plant spacing is 15 to 45 cm (6 to 18 in).   
Management 
Penstemon attenuatus is able to withstand infrequent 
mowing.  This method may be used for weed control in 
newly-established forb plantings, however mowing 
should be delayed until after seed maturity.  Pre-emergent 
herbicides can be used to control annual weeds in fields 
with at least one year of growth, or where seedlings have 
been transplanted.   
Pests and Potential Problems 
None known.

Establishment 
Plants can be established by seed or seedlings.  Seed 
should be drilled into a firm, weed-free seed bed in the 
fall at a rate of 1.65 kg PLS/ha (1.5 lb PLS/ac).  If the 
seed is planted in a mix, the seeding rate should be 
adjusted according to the proportion of P. attenuatus in 
the mix. The drill should be set no deeper than 0.3 cm 
(1/8 in) or the seed should be placed in a separate drill 
box (with other small-seeded species) and the tubes for 
this box should be pulled so the seed is dropped on the 
soil surface.  Drag chains or press wheels should be used 
as long as the seed is not covered with more than 0.3 cm 
(1/8 in) of soil.  The seed can also be broadcast onto the 
soil surface with a broadcast spreader, and pressed into

The best seeding results are obtained from seeding in 
very early spring (because of grass component of 
mix) on heavy to medium textured soils and in late 
fall on medium to light textured soils.  Late summer 
(August - mid September) seeding is not 
recommended.  Dormant fall seedings (preferred 
seeding period for penstemons) will pre-chill seed 
and reduce seed dormancy which is very strong in 
some species.  Mulching, irrigation and weed control 
all benefit stand establishment.  Seedling vigor is 
good, but not as good as most grasses.  Germination 
may not occur until the second growing season.

shoots translocate methane from the substrate.  
Arrow arum fruit is a preferred food of wood ducks,

tufted with thick fibrous roots.  The 4 to 30 inch long 
ascending leaves are 3 to 8 inches wide, and have 
three prominent veins with an abrupt, sharp tip.   
Arrow arum is monoecious, with both male and 
female parts contained in a partially closed 4 to 8 
inch green spathe.  It blooms from May to July.  As 
the fruit matures the entire flowering stem curves 
downward, immersing the spathe.  The green berry-
like fruit is up to 1/2 inch long, and usually contains 
one seed.  Upon separation from the flowering stem, 
this floatable fruit begins to turn black.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD fs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_Establishment='Arrow arum predominantly relies on its seed 
production for re-establishment and population 
distribution, but it can be propagated vegetatively.  
There are an average of 500 cleaned seeds per pound.  
When the fruit of this species falls into or is stored in 
water, the fruit coating swells and ruptures.  The seed 
separates, sinks, then begins to germinate if site 
conditions are adequate.  This same seedling 
development process can easily be replicated in 
cultivated fields or in greenhouses.   
Vegetative propagation is by root bulb divisions.  The 
bulbs form in layers around a root mass, which may 
be as deep as 8 inches.  Once dug, the bulbs are 
broken from the root mass, then either directly 
planted or transplanted into containers or production 
beds.  One mature plant may produce up to ten of 
these planting units.

used for livestock feed. 
Forage: Reed canarygrass is primarily adapted for 
permanent hay or pasture on sites too wet for good 
performance of other forage plants.  The forage 
should be grazed or mowed prior to heading as both 
quality and palatability decline rapidly after heading.  
A common mistake is to use reed canarygrass on wet 
sites where timely harvest is not possible.  
Wildlife: This grass provides excellent nesting and 
escape cover and the shattered seeds are readily eaten 
by many species of birds.

ripens from the top down and shatters readily as it 
matures.  The seed has a short storage life, up to 5 
years, and should be checked for germination within 
6 months of its use.  Reed canarygrass has excellent 
frost tolerance and is well suited to wet soils that are 
poorly drained or subject to flooding.  It also has 
good drought tolerance.  Growth begins in early 
spring and continues through the growing season.

UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_='Description: Pacific ninebark is a long-lived 
perennial shrub of the Rose family native to the 
Pacific Northwest.  It grows rapidly with multiple 
stems achieving 2 to 4 meters in an erect to arching 
form with angled branches.  The reddish papery bark 
peels off in long thin layers giving rise to the 
common name.  Deciduous leaves that appear 
alternately along the stem are 3-10 cm long, 3-5 
lobed and doubly toothed at the margin.  They are 
deeply veined, shiny dark green above and lighter 
beneath with fine star-shaped hairs.  Fall color is 
described as rose-brown. Small (4 mm wide), 5-
petaled creamy white flowers with pink stamens form 
dense rounded clusters at the branch terminals.  
Flowers appear between late April and July.  One to 
four hard shiny pear-shaped yellow seeds form within 
small fruits that are individually surrounded by dark 
reddish brown, bell-shaped bracts.  These bracts often 
persist during winter.  For a current distribution map,

wet areas and on steep north slopes of the coastal 
mountains.  Habitats include streambanks, lake 
margins, and swampy areas or openings in moist 
woods.  Occasionally, Pacific ninebark is found in 
coastal marsh lands and meadows or at drier shrubby 
sites.  Pacific ninebark occurs primarily west of the 
British Columbia Coast, Cascade, and Sierra Nevada 
Mountain Ranges from extreme southeast Alaska to 
central California.  It is less prevalent east of the

Alternate names  
Gordon’s mockorange or Philadelphus gordonianus is 
now classified as the same species.  There are at least 8 
subspecies and varieties.  Other common names include 
syringa, Indian arrowwood, and wild mockorange. Lewis’ 
mock orange and mock-orange are alternative spellings.  
  
Uses  
Lewis mockorange is useful for streambank stabilization, 
including soil bioengineering practices such as live 
staking and live fascines, restoration of riparian areas and 
moist ravines, and erosion control on hillsides and drier 
rocky slopes.  The species provides good food and cover 
for wildlife. It is moderately important winter browse and 
thermal cover for elk and deer.  Quail and squirrels 
consume the seeds.  The flowers are a source of nectar for 
hummingbirds as well as food for certain butterflies, bees, 
and other pollinators.  Livestock generally make light use 
of this plant and palatability is considered low, with 
exceptions.  Sprouts and new shoots are very palatable. 
Native Americans used the wood for arrow shafts, combs, 
bows, cradles, and other products. Bruised leaves and 
flowers formed a soapy lather.  Lewis mockorange is 
cultivated for ornamental purposes and hedgerows in part 
because of its large, showy, fragrant blooms.  
  
Description  
Lewis mockorange is an erect to spreading deciduous 
shrub in the Hydrangea family that grows 4 to 12 ft (1.2-
3.6 m) tall and 3 to 9 ft (1.0-2.7 m) wide.  The leaves are 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
oblong to broadly lance shaped, opposite, simple, and 1 to 
3 in. (2.5-8 cm) long with smooth to sparsely toothed 
margins. This species blooms from May to July 
depending on location. The scented flowers are white 
with four petals, solitary or born terminally in clusters of 
3 to 15, and 1 to 1.5 in. (2-4 cm) wide. The fruit is a 
small, light brown, 4-celled capsule and the bark is light 
brown-grey and shredded or scaly.   
  
Status  
Please consult the Plants Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status, such as state noxious and wetland indicator values.  
  
Adaptation  
Lewis mockorange does best in full sun to moderate 
shade on moist, well drained soils that are coarse to 
medium (rich, loamy) textured. While preferring open 
woods and stream sides, it can also be found on 
moderately dry rocky slopes and bluffs. Its soil pH range 
is 5.4 to 8.0 and its annual precipitation range is 14 to 69 
in. (36-175 cm). Eastern and northern exposures are 
favored by this species.  Classified as fire resistant, it will 
resprout from root crowns after burning and regenerate 
from the seed bank that builds up in the soil.   
  
Distribution-Lewis mockorange occurs naturally from 
southern British Columbia south to northern California 
and east to Alberta and western Montana. The elevation 
range is sea-level to 8000 ft (2400 m) in the mountains.  
Habitat includes riparian zones, wooded ravines, forest 
edges, dry hillsides, chaparral, and fir and pine 
communities. For current distribution, please consult the 
Plant profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
site.

Materials Center in Pullman, WA, released two selected 
class pre-varieties: St. Maries Germplasm (from near Sts. 
Maries, ID) and Colfax Germplasm (from near Colfax, 
WA).  For projects in other regions, material originating 
from the nearest natural population should be favored.  
Ornamental varieties in the landscape nursery trade 
include ‘Cheyenne’, ‘Blizzard’ (winter hardy), ‘Marjorie 
Schmidt’(double flowered), ‘Snow Velvet’, ‘Fallbrook’, 
‘Goose Creek’,  Mount Tahoma  (variegated), and

Limitations or environmental concerns  
Few insect or disease pest problems have been described, 
but seedlings can be susceptible to damping off. The 
foliage and twigs are edible to ungulates, suggesting a 
degree of safety.  However, the species is listed as 
poisonous to animals and humans by the FDA’s Center 
for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.  Its seeds are 
poisonous according to some sources, but other plant 
parts may be implicated. The species is generally not 
considered weedy.   
  
Establishment  
Lewis mockorange is readily propagated by seed, stem 
cuttings, layering, root suckers, or division.  Dried 
capsules are collected in late summer and crushed to 
release the seed. The seed should be stored cool and dry 
but germination greatly improves with 2 to 5 months of 
moist cold stratification (prechilling at 1 to 5°C or 33 to 
41°F) to overcome dormancy. Containers, beds for 
bareroot plant production, and weed free, well drained 
revegetation sites may be sown in the fall (untreated seed) 
or spring (treated seed) and the seed lightly covered. The 
species may be propagated from softwood cuttings taken 
in spring and treated with 1000 ppm of IBA (Indole-
butyric acid). Hardwood cuttings can be similarly treated 
but often root readily without enhancement, allowing for 
direct sticking or live staking on revegetation sites. Mulch 
or irrigation the first summer can greatly improve 
establishment of unrooted cuttings and rooted stock, as 
can weed suppression. Fall planting is usually best. 
Protection from animal browse may be critical.

Leaves vary in length from a few inches to a foot and 
are about 1/4 inch wide, narrowing gently toward the 
tip.  Heads are spike-like and dense, from 2 to 6 
inches in length.  Seed is very small and usually

with equal or slightly greater spread.  It has linear, 
grass-like leaves with parallel venation. lower leaves 
are up to 10 inches long by ¾ inch wide, becoming 
progressively smaller up the stems.  Both the leaves 
and stems are covered with a whitish, silky hair that

UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_='Management 
Weed Control 
In conservation plantings due to the strong spreading 
nature of narrowleaf silkgrass, weed control typically 
is not a major concern.  However in some situations 
weeds may be problematic, mowing and spot 
herbicide applications are the two best weed control 
options.  Mowing at a height of 4’ – 6’ is an effective 
way to control taller growing weeds.  Stop mowing 
when flower buds of silkgrass emerge in late summer 
(MD).  Established stands are also tolerant of late 
winter/early spring burning.  Be aware though that 
burning the foliage creates a thick smoke due to the 
resins in the leaves. 
 
Pre-emergent herbicides Treflan™ (trifluralin) and 
Surflan™ (oryzalin) have been used successfully to 
prevent weed seed germination in established stands.  
Yellow nutsedge has also been controlled effectively 
by the selective post-emergent herbicide Manage™. 
 
For seed production fields, a multivator type 
cultivator (spaced on 4’ rows) will reduce weed 
competition.  Cultivate areas around the plants only 
during early stages of growth as you might damage 
rhizomes of older plants. Alternately, planting a 
cover crop of hard fescue or red fescue between rows 
when plugs are transplanted will limit weed 
competition.      
 
Irrigation 
Supplemental watering may be needed if droughty 
conditions arise after planting during the first season.  
An established stand can tolerate dry conditions and 
will not require irrigation. 
 
Fertilization 
Fertilization during the establishment is not 
recommended.  Established stands can be fertilized 
according to soil test results.  In nitrogen deficient 
soils 30 – 50 lbs. nitrogen/acre applied will help 
maintain stands.

either seeding or vegetative reproduction.  Seeds 
(including dormant seeds if prechilled) can be sown 
in the fall or spring, pressed into the soil at densities 
from 15 to 75 seedlings per square foot.  Seeds 
germinate 1 to 2 weeks following seedfall.  
Germination requires mineral soil.  The seed’s large 
size and persistent wing prevent it from penetrating 
through the litter.  Seedlings are stemless after one 
growing season and this lasts from 2 to many years.  
During this grass-stage, the seedling develops an 
extensive root system, and the root collar increases in 
diameter.  When the root collar diameter approaches 
1 inch in diameter, height growth begins.  A field-
grown seedling grows 10 feet in 3 years once height 
growth is initiated.  Branch production is delayed 
until the seedling reaches 10 to 16 feet in height.

from the root collar. Once height growth begins, 
sprouting ability decreases rapidly.

Longleaf pine is intolerant to both shade and 
competition.  With frequent fire, uneven-aged pure 
stands form park-like savannahs.  Because longleaf 
pine regenerates in openings created by dead trees, 
small clusters of trees of the same age are dispersed 
throughout the stand.  In the absence of frequent fire, 
the species is replaced by hardwoods and other 
southern pines. this hastens the decline of mature 
longleaf pine.  Lightning ignited fires are pivotal to

absent, they do feed on the understory species.  The 
seeds of ponderosa pine are choice food of red-
winged blackbirds, chickadees, mourning doves, 
finches, evening grosbeaks, jays, Clark s nutcrackers, 
nuthatches, white-throated sparrows, rufous-sided

Plant Fact Sheet
 
Red pine provides cover for many species of mammals 
and birds.  Deer, small mammals and songbirds feed on 
the seed. 
Agroforestry: Pinus resinosa is used in tree strips for 
windbreaks.  They are planted and managed to protect 
livestock, enhance crop production, and control soil 
erosion.  Windbreaks can help communities with harsh 
winter conditions better handle the impact of winter 
storms and reduce home heating costs during the winter 
months and cooling cost in the summer. 
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
Description 
General: Red pine (Pinus resinosa) is a medium sized 
tree, up to twenty-five meters high and seventy-five 
centimeters in diameter (Farar 1995).  The leaves are soft 
and flexible evergreen needles, in clusters of two, slender, 
4”-6” long, dark green borne in dense tufts at the ends of 
branchlets.  The fruit is ovoid-conic, with thin scales, 
becoming light chestnut-brown at maturity.  The bark is 
thick and slightly divided by shallow fissures into broad 
flat ridges covered by thin loose red-brown scales 
(Sargent 1961).  The root system is moderately deep, 
wide spreading, and very wind firm.  
 
Distribution:   
Red pine is native to northeastern United States.  This 
species ranges from Newfoundland and Manitoba, south 
to the mountains of Pennsylvania, west to Minnesota 
(Dirr 1990).  For current distribution, please consult the 
Plant profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
site.   
Adaptation 
Red pine occurs most often on well drained, dry, highly 
acid, sandy soils of outwash plains, and gravelly ridges 
(Barnes &amp. Wagner 1981).  It is frequently found where 
the soil fertility is low, in pure stands or mixed with 
species such as jack pine, white pine, aspens, oaks, and 
white birch.  This species prefers full sun and is shade 
intolerant and extremely cold tolerant.  Pinus resinosa is 
easily cultivated in nurseries and easily raised in 
plantations (Ibid.).

Uses 
Economic: Red pine wood is moderately hard and straight 
grained.  It is grown primarily for the production of wood 
used for poles, lumber, cabin logs, railway ties, post, 
pulpwood, and fuel.  The bark is occasionally used for 
tanning leather (Sargent 1961).   
Ethnobotanic: The inner bark of Pinus resinosa was 
pounded as a poultice for any kind of inflamed wound, 
sore, or ulcer when white pine bark was not available 
(Fielder 1975).   
 
Landscaping &amp. Wildlife: Red pine is an attractive tree that 
is used in recreational areas because of its colorful bark.

Establishment 
Propagation by Seed: Cones ripen from August to 
October with natural seed dispersal occurring between 
October and November.  However, seeds can be 
artificially harvested by kiln drying ripe cones for nine 
hours at 130ºF (Dirr &amp. Heuser 1987).  Fresh seed has no 
dormancy and will germinate immediately upon sowing.  
Stored seed requires two months cold stratification.  
Optimum temperature for germination is 77ºF (Ibid.).   
Management 
Most red pine natural stands originate after a forest fire.  
Fire is necessary for regeneration because it prepares a 
seedbed by reducing much of the humus, and competition 
from other trees and shrubs, decreases the number of 
cone-destroying insects, and thins out the overstory 
(Farrar 1995).  Once established, red pine requires little 
care.  Tip and shoot moths sometime attack it.

UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_Uses='Red spruce is one of the most important forest trees 
in the northeast.  The wood is light, soft, narrow-
ringed and faintly tinged with red.  It is the most 
common species of eastern spruce lumber.  Because 
of its resonance, it is especially adapted to sounding 
boards in musical instruments.  It makes up a large 
percentage of spruce pulpwood produced in the 
northeast.  It is used as a Christmas tree also. 
Red spruce provides food and cover for various 
mammals and birds.  The spruce grouse feeds on the 
buds and foliage. red squirrels eat buds and seeds. 
varying hare browse twigs and foliage. porcupines 
feed upon the bark.  Red spruce seeds make up 25 to 
50 percent of the diet of white-winged crossbills.  
Red spruce can be an important cover tree in northern 
New England deer yards.

trunk diameters of nearly two feet.  Larger sizes are 
attained in the southern Appalachians.  Needles are 
four sided, dark, shiny, yellow-green, and about 1/2 
inch long, growing singly from all sides of the twigs 
and branches.  The slender new twigs have a reddish 
coat of down through the first year.  This, together 
with the short incurved needles, help distinguish red 
spruce from most other spruces.  There are about 
139,000 seeds per pound. 
' WHERE symbol='piru';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD fs_AdaptationandDistribution TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_AdaptationandDistribution='In northern New England it is found mainly on 
shallow till soils that average about 18 inches deep to 
a compact layer.  At higher elevations it often grows 
in organic soils overlying rocks.  On poorly drained 
soils, lack of aeration limits its growth.  In the 
northern part of its range, red spruce grows at 
elevations from near sea level to about 4,500 feet.  In 
the southern Appalachians it is limited to slopes and 
mountain tops above 3,500 feet in West Virginia and 
above 4,500 feet in Tennessee and North Carolina. 
Unfortunately, red spruce is showing damage from 
air pollution throughout its range, particularly at the 
higher elevations.

' WHERE symbol='piru';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD fs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_Establishment='Good seed production of red spruce usually begins 
after the tree is 30 years old.  Heavy seed crops occur 
every three to eight years.  Spruce seedlings have 
exceptionally slow growing, fibrous, shallow roots.  
Consequently, a critical survival factor in natural 
establishment is the depth of the organic layers on 
which the seed germinates.  If the thickness of the 
layer exceeds two inches, the roots of spruce 
seedlings may not reach mineral soil and the moisture 
needed to carry them through dry periods.  Red 
spruce is very shade tolerant, but requires nearly full 
sun light for optimum development. 
Red spruce can be established in nurseries as easily 
as any of the other spruces.  It is used some for 
reforestation in the northeast.

Red spruce has not generally received intensive 
management in the northeast.  It can be harvested by

Field of peas. Rebecca McGee, USDA-ARS 
 
Alternative Names 
Common Alternate Names:  garden pea, field pea, spring 
pea, English pea, common pea, green pea (Pisum sativum 
L. ssp. sativum). Austrian winter pea (Pisum sativum L. 
ssp. sativum var. arvense) 
 
Scientific Alternate Names: Pisum arvense L., Pisum 
humile Boiss. &amp. Noe, Pisum sativum L. ssp. arvense (L.) 
Poir., Pisum sativum L. var. arvense (L.) Poir., Pisum

macrocarpon Ser., Pisum sativum L. ssp. sativum, and 
Pisum sativum L. ssp. sativum var. arvense (L.) Poir.   
Uses 
Commercial crop: Peas are a cool-season crop grown for 
their edible seed or seed pods.  Garden or green peas are 
harvested before the seed is mature for the fresh or fresh-
pack market (Elzebroek and Wind, 2008).  Sugar snap 
peas and snow peas lack the inner pod fiber and are also 
harvested early for the fresh or fresh-pack market 
(McGee, 2012).  Field peas, including fall-sown Austrian 
winter peas, are harvested when seeds are mature and dry, 
and are primarily blended with grains to fortify the 
protein content of livestock feed.  Dried peas are also sold 
for human consumption as whole, split or ground peas.  
Peas are a nutritious legume, containing 15 to 35% 
protein, and high concentrations of the essential amino 
acids lysine and tryptophan (Elzebroek and Wind, 2008).   
 
Forage crop:  Peas are grown alone or with cereals for 
silage and green fodder (Elzebroek and Wind, 2008).  
Peas can also be grazed while in the field.  Young 
Austrian winter pea plants will regrow after being grazed 
multiple times (Clark, 2007). 
 
Rotational crop:  Peas and other legumes are desirable in 
crop rotations because they break up disease and pest 
cycles, provide nitrogen, improve soil microbe diversity 
and activity, improve soil aggregation, conserve soil 
water, and provide economic diversity.   
 
Green manure and cover crop: Peas are grown as green 
manures and cover crops because they grow quickly and 
contribute nitrogen to the soil (Clark, 2007).  Pea roots 
have nodules, formed by the bacteria Rhizobium 
leguminosarum, which convert atmospheric nitrogen to 
ammonia.  Peas also produce an abundance of succulent 
vines that breakdown quickly and provide nitrogen 
(Sarrantonio, 1994, as cited by Clark, 2007).  Austrian 
winter peas are the most common type of pea used as a 
green manure or cover crop because they are adapted to 
cold temperatures and fit in many rotations. 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
Description and Adaptation 
General:  Legume family (Fabaceae).  The pea is a cool-
season annual vine that is smooth and has a bluish-green 
waxy appearance.  Vines can be up to 9 ft long, however 
modern cultivars have shorter vines, about 2 ft long.  The 
stem is hollow, and the taller cultivars cannot climb 
without support (Elzebroek and Wind, 2008).  Leaves are 
alternate, pinnately compound, and consist of two large 
leaflike stipules, one to several pairs of oval leaflets, and 
terminal tendrils (McGee, 2012).   
 
Flowers have five green fused sepals and five white, 
purple or pink petals of different sizes.  The top petal is 
called the ‘standard’, the two small petals in the middle 
are fused together and called the ‘keel’ (because of their 
boat-like appearance), and the bottom two petals taper 
toward the base and are called the ‘wings’ (Elzebroek and 


Page 2
Wind, 2008).  The fruit is a closed pod, 1 to 4 inches long 
that often has a rough inner membrane.  Ripe seeds are 
round, smooth or wrinkled, and can be green, yellow, 
beige, brown, red-orange, blue-red, dark violet to almost 
black, or spotted.   
Peas are adapted to many soil types, but grow best on 
fertile, light-textured, well-drained soils (Hartmann et al., 
1988. Elzebroek and Wind, 2008).  Peas are sensitive to 
soil salinity and extreme acidity.  The ideal soil pH range 
for pea production is 5.5 to 7.0 (Hartmann et al., 1988).  
Peas grow well with 16 to 39 inches annual precipitation 
(Elzebroek and Wind, 2008). 
 
Uncovered pea plants may tolerate temperatures as low as 
14°F, and if covered with snow, may tolerate 
temperatures as low as -22°F (Elzebroek and Wind, 
2008).  Peas are most productive at temperatures of 55 to 
64°F (Hartmann et al., 1988).   
Distribution:  Pisum sativum is currently grown in 
temperate regions, at high elevations, or during cool 
seasons in warm regions throughout the world (Elzebroek 
and Wind, 2008). Major pea producers are China, India, 
Canada, Russia, France and the United States (Food and 
Agriculture Organization, 2012).  In the United States, the 
most production occurs in Washington, Montana, and 
North Dakota (USDA-National Agricultural Statistics 
Service, 2011).   
Establishment 
Peas are established by seed in the spring or fall.  Seed 
should be inoculated with Rhizobium leguminosarum 
prior to planting in fields where peas have not been 
previously grown to ensure root nodule formation and the 
fixation of atmospheric nitrogen.  Typical seeding rates 
range from 50 to 80 lb/acre when drilled and 90 to 100 
lb/acre when broadcast (Clark, 2007).  Seed is planted at a 
depth of 1.5 to 3 inches in rows spaced 6 to 12 inches 
apart (Elzebroek and Wind, 2008).   
 
Management 
Peas are poor competitors with weeds.  Rapid seedling 
emergence, adequate crop density, pre- and post-plant 
tillage, and herbicides help reduce weed pressure 
(Elzebroek and Wind, 2008).   
 
Austrian winter peas grown as a green manure crop can 
produce 90 to 150 lb/acre nitrogen (Clark, 2007). The 
actual amount of nitrogen available for the next crop 
depends on timing and method of incorporation, soil 
temperature, moisture, and other factors.  Peas are easily 
killed with herbicides, mowing, or disking.  This should 
be done at full-bloom stage to optimize the nitrogen 
contribution (Clark, 2007).   
 
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Peas are susceptible to multiple foliar, root, and seed 
diseases. 
Environmental Concerns 
None. 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
Numerous pea cultivars for various purposes are 
commercially available.

some cultivars turn yellow-green in winter.  
Seedlings are available at most commercial conifer 
nurseries.  Seed origin is extremely important in 
obtaining quality trees for a given sub-region.

Shortspur seablush is a native, annual wildflower that can 
paint entire hillsides pink in the spring.  It is a member of 
the valerian family (Valerianaceae).  The stems are 
usually unbranched, slender, upright, angled, and hairless, 
reaching 4 to 24 inches tall.  The basal leaves are early 
deciduous, while the more persistent stem leaves are 
opposite, smooth-margined or slightly toothed, hairless, 
and 3/8 to 2½ inches long by 1/8 to 7/8 inch wide.  Lower 
leaves have short stalks and are spatula to egg-shaped 
with the wider end near the tip, while upper leaves have 
no stalk, are oblong to elliptic in shape, and often 
clasping.  The small, bright pink to white flowers grow in 
densely crowded, more or less headlike clusters at the 
stem tips.  Individual flowers have five petals that are 
fused into a 2-lipped tube less than 3/8 inch long with a 
spur that often has a wider, rounded tip.  Flowering period 
is from March to June.  The fruits are achenes and are 
one-seeded, keeled, and sometimes winged.

Alternate Names 
Tallow weed, California plantain    
 
Uses 
Wildlife: Hookers plantain is a cool season forage 
recommended for cool season upland wildlife plantings 
and in range seeding mixes. Hookers plantain seed is 
consumed by game birds such as bobwhite quail and 
mourning doves, and the foliage is eaten by bobwhite 
quail, Rio Grande wild turkeys, white-tailed deer, and 
cattle. 
 
Erosion:  Hookers plantain also can be used in many 
types of conservation plantings, such as stream-side 
buffers and filter strips. 
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g. threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
Description and Adaptation 
Hookers plantain is a short-stemmed, cool season annual 
with a slender taproot.  The leaves are linear to narrowly 
oblanceolate, with margins that are entire or with small 
scattered denticulations.  The leaves are up to 3 dm. long 
and 2 cm. wide, but usually much smaller and are 
glabrous to lanate.   
 
The scapes (inflorescences) are erect or ascending, and 
may be shorter than or exceed the leaves in height.  The 
scapes are glabrate to pubescent with spikes to 12 cm. 
long and 8 mm. thick, rarely reduced to only 2 flowers.  
The bracts are broad at the base.  The corolla lobes are up 
to 4 mm. long and whitish with a brown spot at base of 
each or brown stripes the entire length of each.  Each 
flower produces two seeds, dull-brown, finely pitted, and 
about 3 mm. long and 1.3 mm wide.  STN-561 
Germplasm contains 197,816 seeds per pound.   
 
Distribution: Please consult the Plant Profile page for this 
species on the PLANTS Web site. 
 
Establishment 
Plantains are established from seed.  Seeds should be 
sown directly into the seedbed.  Germination tests 
conducted by the South Texas Natives Project (2006) 
found germination rates ranging from a low of 28% to a 
high of 94% and rapid initiation of germination following 
the onset of favorable conditions (germination &lt. 36 
hours).  Seed dormancy can be as high as 90% but 
appears to be easily broken by field conditions.  Plantains 
typically take 180 days from planting to seed maturity.  
Forrest Smith, South Texas Natives 
For direct seeding, broadcast or drill seed during 
September through December into a clean, weed free 
seedbed.  Seeds should be covered from ¼ to ½” depth to 
ensure good soil to seed contact.  The full seeding rate for 
Hookers plantain is 10 PLS pounds per acre for a pure 
stand.   When planting this as a component of a seed 
mixture, the seeding rate should be adjusted to the desired 
percent of the mix.

Management 
Hookers plantain requires little management.  Seed 
production plots will require occasional weeding.  It can 
survive in both droughty and moist conditions.  For seed 
production purposes, occasional irrigation during 
extremely droughty periods may help seed fertility.   
 
Hookers plantain can be harvested with a combine.  When 
harvesting Hookers plantain, run the combine’s cylinder 
speed at 1100 RPM, the concave at 6 mm, the sieve open 
3/8&quot., and the fan at 600 rpm. To clean the seed, it should 
first be run through a Westrup brush machine and can 
then be cleaned further using a clipper style seed cleaner. 
It is recommended that after cleaning, the seed should be 
stored at 45o
 
Seed increase plots in 2007 at TAES Beeville yielded 
seed with 93 % viability, 90 % seed dormancy, and 79 % 
pure live seed.  Seed yield was estimated at 288 pounds of 
bulk seed per acre.  Seed harvested from seed increase 
plots of STN-561 Germplasm at Kingsville in June 2008 
had 92% viability, 0% dormancy, 94% active 
germination, and 93.49% pure live seed. Seed yield from 
Kingsville plantings was 322 lbs. pure live seed per acre.  
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Thrips have been observed in the seed heads, however 
they are fairly easy to control with organophosphate 
(e.g..Malathion) and carbamate (e.g. Sevin) insecticides.  
Please contact your local agricultural extension specialist 
or county pest specialist to learn what works best in your 
area and how to use it safely.  Always read label and 
safety instructions for each control method.  Trade names 
and control measures appear in this document only to 
provide specific information.  USDA NRCS does not 
guarantee or warranty the products and control methods

Uses 
Wildlife: Redseed plantain is a cool season forage 
recommended for upland wildlife plantings and in range 
seeding mixes. The seed is known to be consumed by 
game birds such as bobwhite quail and mourning doves, 
and the foliage is eaten by bobwhite quail, Rio Grande 
wild turkeys, white-tailed deer, and cattle.  Redseed 
plantain has been shown to be an important component in 
the diets of both scaled and bobwhite quail in southwest 
Texas. 
 
Erosion:  Redseed plantain also can be used in many 
types of conservation plantings, such as stream-side 
buffers and filter strips. 
 
 
 
 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g. threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
 
Description and Adaptation 
Redseed plantain is a cool season, annual with a slender 
taproot.  Leaves are oblanceolate to 35 cm. long and 5 cm. 
wide, but usually much smaller.  The leaves are grayish-
green in color, pubescent, with margins that are entire to 
coarsely pectinate or salient-dentate.   
 
The scapes (inflorescences) are one to several, hirsute, 
and shorter  than to exceeding the leaves in height.  The 
spikes are up to 2 dm. long and 1 cm. thick.  Each flower 
produces two seeds that are bright red to reddish black in 
color.  The seeds are 2-3 mm. long, more than half as 
wide, nearly flat on both sides, and have a thin pale 
margin.  STN-496 Germplasm contains 322,000 seeds per 
pound.

Establishment 
Plantains are established from seed.  Germination tests 
conducted by the South Texas Natives Project (2006) 
found germination rates ranging from a low of 40% to a 
high of 80% and rapid initiation of germination following 
the onset of favorable conditions (germination &lt. 36 
hours).  Plantains typically take 180 days from planting to 
seed maturity.  
For direct seeding, broadcast or drill seed during 
September through December into a clean, weed free 
seedbed.  Seeds should be covered from ¼ to ½” depth to 
ensure good soil to seed contact.  The full seeding rate for 
redseed plantain is 10 PLS pounds per acre for a pure 
stand. When planting this as a component of a seed 




Page 2
mixture, the seeding rate should be adjusted to the desired 
percent of the mix.

F and less than 50% humidity. 
 
Management 
Redseed plantain requires little management.  Seed 
production plots will require occasional weeding.  It can 
survive in both droughty and moist conditions.  For seed 
production purposes, occasional irrigation during 
extremely droughty periods may help seed fertility.   
 
Redseed plantain can be harvested with a combine.  When 
harvesting redseed plantain, run the combine’s cylinder 
speed at 1100 RPM, the concave at 6 mm, the sieve open 
3/8&quot., and the fan at 600 rpm. To clean the seed, it should 
first be run through a Westrup brush machine and can 
then be cleaned further using a clipper style seed cleaner. 
It is recommended that after cleaning, the seed should be 
stored at 45o
 
Seed harvested from seed increase plots of STN-496 
Germplasm at Kingsville in June 2008 had 88% viability, 
12% dormancy, 79% active germination, and 87.43% 
pure live seed. Seed yield from Kingsville plantings was 
400 lbs. pure live seed per acre.  Seed harvested from 
Beeville plots in May 2007 had 98% viability, 45% 
dormancy, 53% active germination, and 89% pure live 
seed. Seed yield in Beeville was 387 lbs. pure live seed 
per acre. 
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Thrips have been observed in the seed heads, however 
they are fairly easy to control with organophosphate 
(e.g.Malathion) and carbamate (e.g. Sevin) insecticides.  
Please contact your local agricultural extension specialist 
or county pest specialist to learn what works best in your 
area and how to use it safely.  Always read label and 
safety instructions for each control method.  Trade names 
and control measures appear in this document only to 
provide specific information.  USDA NRCS does not 
guarantee or warranty the products and control methods 
named, and other products may be equally effective. 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials  
STN-496 Germplasm is a selected class release developed 
from seed originating from Bexar County, Texas.  It was 
released cooperatively between the South Texas Natives 
Project, Texas AgriLife Research-Beeville, and the E. 
Kika de la Garza Plant Materials Center in 2009.  STN-
496 Germplasm will be marketed as part of a blend of 2 
accessions of Plantago called Divot Tallow Weed Blend.  
STN-496 Germplasm was selected for excellent observed 
forage characteristics, ease of mechanical harvest and 
agronomic production, good active seed germination to 
dormancy ratio, and extremely high seed yields in 
comparison to other South Texas collected accessions.  It 
is intended to provide food for wildlife.  Certified seed is 
available and Breeder Seed will be maintained by South 
Texas Natives, Kingsville, Texas.

RIO GRANDE 
CLAMMYWEED

Contributed by: E. “Kika” de la Garza Plant Materials 
Center, Kingsville, Texas &amp. South Texas Natives, 
Kingsville, Texas  
 
Forrest Smith, South Texas Natives  
Uses  
Wildlife: Rio Grande clammyweed is recommended for 
upland wildlife plantings and in range seeding mixes. 
Clammyweed seed is eaten by game birds such as 
bobwhite quail, scaled quail, mourning doves, white-wing 
doves, and Rio Grande wild turkeys, as well as many non-
game species of birds and mammals. Rio Grande 
clammyweed is also an important nectar plant for many 
species of butterflies and provides habitat to many other 
insects. Clammyweed has no grazing value for livestock 
or wildlife.  Clammyweed is often found in dense stands 
of non-native grasses, and may be useful in efforts to 
diversify these stands for wildlife.   
  
Beautification: Rio Grande clammyweed is an attractive 
nectar plant for butterfly gardens.  However, its leaves 
release a strong, unpleasant odor when crushed, so plants 
should be located away from foot traffic areas.

are 2-6 dm. tall and sparsely branched or unbranched.  
The leaflets are in groups of 3 with leaves 2-4 cm long, 5-
20 mm wide.  The flowers are pink to rose with petals 5-
16 mm long.  The fruit is a narrow capsule producing 
numerous rounded seeds.  Rio Grande clammyweed has 
an average of 154,500 seeds per pound.   
  
Distribution: Please consult the Plant Profile page for this 
species on the PLANTS Web site.  
  
Establishment  
Rio Grande clammyweed is an early successional plant. It 
is quick to establish on disturbed soils, grows quickly, and 
provides a favorable environment for other slow to 
germinate native species. In mixed species native 
plantings in south Texas, clammyweed is often the first 
planted species to emerge and flower. Rio Grande 
clammyweed readily re-seeds itself with moderate soil 
disturbance. 
 
Forrest Smith, South Texas Natives  
Seeding trials at Kingsville, Texas have shown good 
establishment from seed in fall (October) and spring 
(April) plantings. Fall plantings should be made at least 2 
months prior to danger of frost so that seed is produced 
before freezing as clammyweed typically requires 45-60 
days from emergence to seed maturity.    
  
For direct seeding, broadcast or drill seed during March 
through May or in September and October into a clean, 
weed free seedbed.  Seeds should be covered from ¼ to 
½” depth to ensure good soil to seed contact.  Plant at a 
seeding rate of 8 PLS (pure live seed) pounds per acre for

a pure stand.  When planting this as a component of a 
seed mixture, the seeding rate should be adjusted to the 
desired percent of the mix.  
 
Javier Hernandez, South Texas Natives 
 
Rio Grande clammyweed requires little management.  
Seed production plots will require occasional weeding.  It 
can survive in both droughty and moist conditions.  For 
seed production purposes, occasional irrigation during 
extremely droughty periods may help seed fertility.    
  
Rio Grande clammyweed can be harvested with a 
combine.  When harvesting clammyweed, run the 
combine’s cylinder speed at 1100 RPM, the concave at 8 
mm, the sieve open 3/8&quot., and the fan at 200 RPM. To 
clean the seed, simply run combined product through a 
clipper style seed cleaner. It is recommended that after 
cleaning, the seed should be stored at 45oF and less than 
50% humidity.  
  
Spring seed harvests near Monte Alto, Texas have had an 
average of 67% PLS, with 15% seed dormancy.  Seed 
yields from June hand harvests (first crop produced) were 
168 lbs. PLS/acre.   Seed increase harvests in June 2008 
at Kingsville, Texas (first crop produced) showed hand 
harvest seed yields averaging 144 lbs. PLS/acre under 
irrigated conditions.  PLS of these harvests averaged 83%.  
 
Pests and Potential Problems  
Green bugs can cause extensive damage to the plants 
foliage, and weevils have been observed in the seed pods. 
Both pests are fairly easy to control with organophosphate 
(e.g.Malathion) and carbamate (e.g. Sevin) insecticides.  
Please contact your local agricultural extension specialist 
or county pest specialist to learn what works best in your 
area and how to use it safely.  Always read label and 
safety instructions for each control method.  Trade names 
and control measures appear in this document only to 
provide specific information.  USDA NRCS does not 
guarantee or warranty the products and control methods 
named, and other products may be equally effective.  
  
Commercial seed production of Rio Grande clammyweed 
should focus on production of the first seed crop 
following planting. Plants commonly flower and produce 
seed beyond the first seed crop, and will set seed until 
frost. however subsequent seed crops have poor seed fill, 
lower active germination, and significantly lower seed 
yields.  
  
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials   
Zapata Germplasm is a selected class release developed 
from seed originating from Dimmit and Zapata County, 
Texas.  It was released cooperatively between the South 
Texas Natives Project and the E. Kika de la Garza Plant 
Materials Center in 2009.  Zapata Germplasm was 
selected for active seed germination and superior field 
performance in comparison to other South Texas 
collected accessions.  It is intended to provide food for 
wildlife.  Certified seed is available and Breeder Seed will 
be maintained by South Texas Natives, Kingsville, Texas.

smooth in younger trees, becoming deeply furrowed 
with whitish cracked bark with age.  The leaves are 
cordate (heart-shaped) with white veins and coarse 
crenate-serrate teeth on the margins. The leaves have 
petioles 1/2 to equal the blade length, laterally 
compressed near the blade which causes the leaves to 
flutter in the wind.  These trees are dioecious, with 
flowers in drooping catkins, which are 4 to 14 cm 
long.  Cottonwoods bloom from March-April.  The 
fruit is an achene, which is attached to a silky hair, en 
masse looking like patches of cotton hanging from 
the limbs, thus the name cottonwood.  The fruits are 
wind dispersed.

this method.   
Currently the Plant Materials Center, in cooperation 
with the Albuquerque Parks Department, is 
conducting research on the effectiveness of sprinkle 
irrigation on Rio Grande floodplains to induce 
germination of naturally dispersed cottonwood seeds 
and subsequent tree establishment.  Preliminary 
results indicate that, when natural flooding cycles are 
absent, appropriately timed sprinkler irrigation of 
riparian areas combined with weed control can 
induce germination of naturally dispersed Fremont’s

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD fs_Management TEXT;

Many land uses in arid watersheds significantly 
decrease or destroy cottonwood riparian forests.  
Livestock grazing has widely been identified as a 
leading factor causing or contributing to degradation 
of riparian habitats in the western United States.  
Timber harvests often adversely affect stream flows.  
Buffer strips can reduce sedimentation rates and 
flood velocities.  Stream diversion for irrigation may 
reduce surface flows to a level insufficient to 
maintain cottonwood vegetation.  Ground-water 
pumping lowers local and regional water tables and 
reduces stream flow, which can eliminate or weaken 
riparian vegetation.

Ornamental: Slender cinquefoil is an attractive plant for 
perennial garden borders, wildflower meadows, openings 
in a woodland or wildlife garden, or around a pond.  
Aside from the beautiful early-summer golden blooms, 
plants have attractive seed heads, showy fall foliage that 
turns shades of pink, orange and yellow, and are generally 
deer-resistant.  
  Plant Fact Sheet
Restoration:  Slender cinquefoil is an important 
component of many native meadow and prairie 
ecosystems.  Restoration projects in these habitats should 
consider including this hardy, perennial wildflower in 
seed mixes. 
Ethnobotanic: This plant was used for medicinal purposes 
by tribes of the Pacific Northwest.  The Okanagan-
Colville took an infusion of pounded roots as a tonic for 
the blood, general aches and pains, diarrhea, and 
gonorrhea, or used the infusion to wash sores.  The 
Thompson Indians used a poultice of mashed leaves and 
roots on wounds to draw out the pain.

Slender cinquefoil, a member of the rose family 
(Rosaceae), is a common, native, tufted perennial 
wildflower that grows from a short, thick rhizome or 
branched woody crown.  Stems are brown-scaly at the 
base and more or less ascending, extensively branched 
upwards, bearing short-woolly to long-spreading hairs, 
and reaching 8 to 40 inches long.  The leaves are gray-
green, oval, 2 ½ to 12 inches wide, divided from a single 
point into 5 to 9 inversely-lance-shaped, sharply toothed 
leaflets.  The underside of the leaves is usually white 
silky-hairy, while the upper surface is green with some 
hairs.  Basal leaves are on long stems that can reach 12 
inches in length.  Flower clusters are loose and consist of 
a few to many golden yellow flowers with five heart-
shaped petals that are 1/8 to 2/3 inch long.  Flowering 
period is June to September.  The fruits are achenes that 
are less than 1/16 inch, more or less smooth, and light 
brown.  Slender cinquefoil is highly variable, with a 
number of ill-defined varieties that sometimes inter-grade 
across their range.   
Slender cinquefoil is common in meadows, grasslands, 
roadsides, subalpine meadows, and open forests to moist 
areas in deserts and arid shrub-steppe regions at 
elevations up to 11,500 ft.  The plants grow well in full 
sun to light shade, moist to fairly dry soil, and have 
moderate saline and calcium carbonate tolerance.  This 
species is widely distributed throughout North America, 
from Alaska south to Baja California and east through the 
northern Great Plains to the Great Lakes Basin and

wildlands throughout much of North America.  Sulphur 
cinquefoil is a noxious weed in British Columbia, 
Colorado, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington.  
Sulphur cinquefoil closely resembles slender cinquefoil 
and can sometimes be found in the same habitats, but 
unlike sulphur cinquefoil, slender cinquefoil rarely forms 
dense patches and is a desirable component of the native 
vegetation.  The two species can be distinguished by the 
styles (&lt.50 per flower, 1.5-2 mm long in P. gracilis. &gt.50

Alternate Names 
redhead grass, clasping leaved pondweed 
Uses 
Claspingleaf pondweed beds stabilize sediments, reduce 
shoreline erosion, and provide valuable habitat and are a 
food source for a variety of fish, macroinvertebrates, 
crustaceans and waterfowl (Thayer et al 1975, Lubbers 
1990). 
 
Habitat: 
Claspingleaf pondweed beds provide protection from 
predators, as well as attracting epiphytes and zooplankton 
upon which other species graze, providing an important 
link in the food web. During the breeding season up to 80 
percent of waterfowl’s diet is plant material, much of it 
aquatic (Kenow and Rusch 1996).  
 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
Description and Adaptation 
Claspingleaf pondweed is a submerged, rooted, flowering 
aquatic plant that grows in alkaline, brackish, and 
freshwater lakes, streams and estuaries.  Substrate 
conditions are often low in organic content forming a firm 
muddy bottom or sand-based sediment in reasonably slow 
moving waters. Plants tend to be darker green colored in 
shallow waters and are a paler green in deeper water 
(Bergstrom et al. 2006). 
 
  
 
Claspingleaf pondweed distribution from USDA-NRCS PLANTS 
Database. 
 
Claspingleaf pondweed is widespread in sheltered coves 
and bays throughout 24 states in the United States, 8 
provinces in Canada, Greenland and St. Pierre Miquelon.  
For updated distribution, please consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
Establishment 
Claspingleaf pondweed pondweed is propagated through 
cuttings, rootstocks, and seeds. When starting new 
populations, using cuttings and rootstocks is the least time 
consuming method.. Cuttings can be taken and 
immediately planted to create new ones utilizing a 
planting substrate composed of oyster shell and peat 
moss. Seed propagation may result in a much higher yield

of plants than asexual propagation. Seeds must be 
harvested from plants at the right time of year.  
 
Germination rates under ideal conditions are variable 
from 16-60% (STAC 2007). Seed collections occur from 
late July to August. Seed harvesting of the upper third 
water column includes the plant stems and florescence 
(i.e. 1 foot down in 3 feet of water, or 10 inches down in a 
30 inch tank).  Seeds must be harvested from plants at the 
right time of year. Germination rates under ideal 
conditions are variable from 16-60% (STAC 2007). Best 
germination results require six to nine months of cold 
storage (at 40 deg F) submerged in 15 parts per thousand 
(ppt) saline water with aeration. To encourage fast and 
high germination after the 6 to 9 months of cold storage 
transfer the seed to a warm, freshwater environment. 
Management 
In a domestic tank or experimental setting one of the 
major concerns is ensuring that algae or invasive 
vegetation does not overwhelm stock plants. Keeping 
nutrients and organic matter low helps , but additions of 
water and tank cleaning with nets similar to those used 
cleaning pools are important factors in aquatic plant 
maintenance. 
Pests and Potential Problems 
In most propagation and restoration scenarios natural 
predators such as crabs or cownose rays require an 
exclosure is to protect plants.  Non-migrating Canada 
geese graze extensively on the vegetation. The worst 
herbivores of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) are the 
non-native mute swans and native cownose rays. While it 
is unlikely they will wipe out the entire SAV population 
in a given water body, they do reduce above and 
belowground plant material, and they have the potential to 
destroy a restoration plantings in a single visit. 
Environmental Concerns 
There are no known issues with respect to clasping 
pondweed and environmental problems. 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
There are no known cultivars, improved, and/or selected 
materials for claspingleaf pondweed.  This plant is 
commercially available from specialized coastal and 
wetland plant nurseries.

Recreation: Kentucky bluegrass turf is excellent for 
ball fields and other heavy use areas such as camp 
grounds, golf fairways, and picnic areas. 
Wildlife: This plant is highly palatable to elk and is 
one of the better grasses for deer.  The tender plants 
are grazed immediately after growth begins and the 
leaves remain succulent and green as long as soil 
moisture is present. Seeds are eaten by several kinds 
of songbirds and rodents.  Leaves are eaten by rabbits 
and turkey.

(stratification).  Therefore, fall seeding is advised.  
No special physical conditioning of the seed is 
needed.  Seed weight varies from 900,000-1,500,000 
seeds/lb.  Each pound of pure live seed (PLS) sown 
per acre results in 20-34 live seeds/sq. ft.  Seeding 
depth must be shallow, preferably less than ¼ in. on 
heavier soils and ½ in. on lighter soils.  Pine 
bluegrass is rarely sown alone (2-3 lbs/ac) but rather 
in mixes with other grasses (0.5-2 lbs/ac).  Higher 
rates (4-8+ lbs/ac) are applied to higher precipitation 
zones (30+ inches/yr) and experimental uses such as 
low input cover.  Rate of establishment from seed is 
slow.  If fall sown, flowering can occur the following 
spring in milder climates.

UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_Description='Sandberg bluegrass is one of the native bluegrasses 
and is an important component of the sagebrush 
grassland vegetation in the western United States.  It 
is a medium-sized cool season bunchgrass with 
numerous fine basal leaves 8 to 16 inches long.  
These leaves are a smooth, deep blue green and are 
folded with keel-shaped tips typical of bluegrasses.  
This long-lived perennial reaches 2 to 4 feet in 
height.  Its inflorescence is a narrow panicle up to 8 
inches long.  It has a strong fibrous root system but 
will occasionally develop short rhizomes.  The flower 
spikelets do not have a web of hairs at the base, 
unlike Kentucky bluegrass, which does. 
Sandberg bluegrass begins growth early in spring, 
before crested wheatgrass, and matures in early 
summer unless moisture is sufficient to keep it green 
all summer.  In this respect it is the most persistent of 
all the cool season grasses.

seeding in spring it is advisable to plant as soon as 
possible since high soil temperatures will put the 
seedlings into dormancy.  Prechilling will improve 
germination of the seed.  Seedling vigor is moderate

Sandberg bluegrass has good palatability to livestock 
in spring and fall and to deer in the spring.  It has 
excellent palatability to elk all year.  Cattle prefer 
Sandberg bluegrass in the spring and it should be 
grazed when it reaches eight inches in height.  
Livestock graze Sandberg bluegrass in the vegetative  
stage, but avoid it when headed.  Livestock should be 
removed while there is still enough moisture in the 
ground to allow regrowth before plants go dormant.  
Regrowth can be grazed after the plants turn green in 
the fall, but a 6-inch stubble should be left. 
Overgrazing and severe trampling are injurious to 
native stands of this grass and without proper 
protective grazing, a range will deteriorate rapidly.  
New seedlings are easily pulled up by grazing 
animals and, therefore, should not be grazed until the 
stands are more than 2 years old and are sufficiently 
well-rooted to withstand grazing.  Spring and fall

Uses 
Native Americans regularly consumed fresh fruits of 
Chickasaw plum or dried them for winter.  First cultivated 
in 1874, the fruit was used for making wine, jam, and 
jelly. Its white flowers are attractive and fragrant in the 
spring, producing a beautiful flower show.  It should be 
part of a native landscape planting.  Chickasaw plum is a 
popular plant for use in developing wildlife habitat on 
sandy soils.  The thorny thicket is valuable for songbird 
and game bird nesting, loafing, and roosting.  Various 
other animals also use it for loafing, bedding, and escape 
cover.  Numerous species of birds and other animals 
consume the fruit.  The plums provide nesting cover for 
northern bobwhites, brown thrashers, northern 
mockingbirds, and gray catbirds in the southeastern U S.  
Northern bobwhites nest in mixed shrub communities 
composed predominantly of Chickasaw plum in Texas. 
Field sparrow, Bell’s vireo, loggerhead shrike, and 
painted bunting also require woody plants including 
Chickasaw plum for nesting.  Plum is important to lesser 
prairie-chickens for resting, escape, and thermal cover.  
Cattle use plum thickets to escape the summer sun and

Description and Adaptation 
Chickasaw plum is a short, thickly branched shrub 3 to 10 
feet tall, often forming extensive thickets or colonies due 
to extensive suckering in the western part of its range.  In 
the eastern parts of its range it forms a small tree. height 
at maturity is 14 to 25 feet.  Leaves are simple, lanceolate 
to oblong lanceolate, 0.8 to 2.4 inches long, 0.4 to 0.8 
inches wide, acute or short acuminate, rounded at the 
base, slender, lustrous and glabrous above, strongly 
trough shaped with stalks that bear two red glands near 
the apex with leaf teeth finely serrate, tipped with glands 
or scars of these.  Its numerous zigzag twigs are smooth, 
reddish brown and slender.  Younger branches have 
smooth reddish brown bark with large, horizontal 
lenticels.  Older trees have rough, scaly trunk bark.  There 
are short, side twigs that bear flowers and end in sharp 
points.  Open-pollinated and early blooming, March-
April, the numerous off-white or yellowish-white flowers 
with little fragrance appear before the leaves and are less 
than 1/2 inch across. sepals green, no glands on the calyx 
lobes.  The ripe fruits small, 1/4 to 1/2 inch in size, thin-

a slight bloom. the stone is small, rough, yellowish, and 
turgid, almost spherical. fruiting in June-August.  Some 
trees bear edible fruits. others have very bitter fruits.   
 
Chickasaw plum grows in almost any soil, except strongly 
alkaline.  It occurs naturally on sandy soils, but will 
perform well when planted on heavier clay-loam soils.  
Although partially shade tolerant, it performs best in full 
sun.   
 
Establishment 
One-year-old, bare-root seedlings, 18 to 24 inches tall, are 
used in plantings.  Control of weed and grass competition 
during the first and second years is important in survival, 
early growth, and final establishment of the plants.   
 
Management 
The plums are drought tolerant and require little 
maintenance once established.  Young plants should be 
protected from herbivores such as rabbits, deer, and cattle.  
Protection of older stands during prescribed burns or other 
brush management programs would favor shrub nesting 
birds on grasslands.  Fire can set back the above ground 
growth of Chickasaw plum, but does not kill the plants.  
Protect the thickets from prescribed burning with disk 
strips.  Disk strips stimulate the production of forbs and 
legumes as food sources near the thickets which is 
beneficial to wildlife.  Should fire run through the thicket, 
if it has bare ground, minimal damage occurs, otherwise 
expect 3-5 years of recovery time for the over story 
structure to be recreated.   
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Insects and disease may occasionally attack this species, 
but are not a serious problem in conservation plantings.  
Plum curculio is the primary insect pest of Chickasaw 
plum.  Fruit drop and fruit damage caused by this insect 
must be controlled if commercial plantings of plum are to 
be successful.  Major disease problems include brown rot 
of the fruit and bacterial leaf spot.  Little natural 
resistance to these diseases exist.  Chemical controls for 
the major pests of plum are widely available.  Consult 
your local agricultural extension specialist for 
recommended products and application rates.  Rabbits 
may chew on the bark, but new sprouts will form to 
replace injured stems.  Deer can rub on young trees and 
cause considerable damage.

Anthropologists indicate cherries have been 
harvested in Eurasia from 4,000 to 5,000 B.C.  In 
1629, chokecherry was imported to England where it 
has been cultivated as an ornamental.  It was first 
cultivated in North America as an orchard crop in 
1724. Conservation uses include plantings in 
shelterbelts, windbreaks, wildlife plantings, and mass 
plantings for erosion control.

The seeds are toxic due to production of hydrocyanic 
acid in the leaves, stems and seeds.  The almond-like 
nuts are treated to deactivate the poisonous 
glycosides before they are put on the market.  Cases 
of illness and deaths have been traced back to eating 
the seeds of these trees.

UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_DescriptionandAdaptation='General: Rose Family (Rosaceae).  Chokecherry is a 
native, perennial, deciduous, woody, thicket-forming 
large erect shrub or small tree. It rarely reaches a 
height of over 30 feet.  The crown is irregular and 
from 10 to 20 feet wide when mature.  The stems are 
numerous and slender.  Reproduction can either be by 
seed or root rhizomes.  
  
Leaves are dark green and glossy above and paler 
beneath.  They are alternate, simple, glabrous, oval to 
broadly elliptic in shape, 1 to 4 inches long, and 3/4 
to 2 inches wide.  The margins are toothed with 
closely-spaced sharp teeth pointing outward forming 
a serrated edge.  They turn yellow in autumn.  
  
The bark of young trees may vary from gray to a 
reddish brown.  As it ages the bark turns darker, into 
brownish-black and becomes noticeably furrowed.  
The bark is distinctly marked by horizontal rows of 
raised air pores (lenticels).  With maturation the 
lenticels develop into shallow grooves.   
  
It has perfect flowers which are aromatic and 
arranged in cylindrical racemes 3 to 6 inches long.  
The racemes always grow on the current year s leafy 
twig growth.  Individual flowers are perfect, 1/4 to 
3/8 inch in diameter with 5 white petals.  The flowers 
start appearing before the leaves are fully developed.  
Flowers may appear from April to July and fruits 
form a couple of months later.     
 
The fruits are spherical drupes (fleshy fruit with a 
stone in the center), globose, 1/4 to 3/8 inch in 
diameter.  Small ripe cherries range in color from 
dark red or purple to almost black.  There are from 
3,000 to 5,000 seeds per pound.

The roots are a network of rhizomes.  Deep root 
systems grow at irregular intervals along the length 
of the rhizomes.  Rhizomes can extend beyond the 
drip zone, up to 35 feet away from the base of the 
tree.  Rhizomes grow up to 3/4 inch in diameter.  
  
There are three recognized varieties of Prunus 
virginiana.  The variety demissa is commonly called 
western chokecherry.  It produces dark red fruit.  The 
variety melanocarpa produces black fruit.  The 
variety virginiana produces crimson to deep red fruit. 
This variety can be found in two forms, one with red 
and one with white fruit.  
  
Chokecherry occurs naturally in a wide range of soil 
types and textures.  
     
Many wildlife animals eat the fruit and distribute it.

Erosion control: It is a good erosion control plant 
because it can form thickets and spread by rhizomes. 
Livestock: It is poor to fair forage for cattle, sheep, 
and goats and useless for horses. however, the foliage 
is consumed when the range is over utilized or in 
livestock concentration areas such as near water, 
along driveways, and near bedding grounds.  One 
fourth of a pound of foliage is fatal to sheep and 1½ 
pounds will kill a 500 pound cow.  This must be 
eaten at a single feeding and is usually lethal if very 
little other forage is consumed.  The poisoning agent 
is hydrocyanic (prussic) acid.  Cattle will usually not 
eat much chokecherry when a good supply of other 
forage species are available. 
 
Recreation: This plant makes good screening in 
campgrounds and picnic areas. 
Wildlife: Western chokecherry is excellent to good 
forage for deer and elk.  The fruit is relished by bear, 
many species of songbirds, pheasants, and grouse.

Chokecherry, common chokecherry.  
  
Uses  
Black  chokecherry  is  a  valuable  plant  for  providing  not 
just  food,  but  shelter,  cover,  and  nesting  habitat  for 
wildlife.  Its  fruit  is  readily  sought  out  by  bear,  birds, 
rabbits,  rodents,  and  small  mammals.  The  young 
immature  plants  are  desirable  to  deer,  elk,  moose,  bear, 
bighorn sheep, and pronghorn during the spring as well as 
winter months. During the spring months, while in bloom, 
black chokecherry provides an excellent source of nectar 
for many pollinators such as ants, butterflies, honeybees, 
flies,  and  hummingbirds.  Black  chokecherry  is  used  in 
urban  landscaping  enhancement  plantings,  range  and 
mined 
land  reclamation  plantings,  shelterbelts,  and 
windbreaks.  Its  extensive  root  system  is  beneficial  in 
reducing  and  controlling  soil  erosion  in  rangelands  and 
mine land reclamation. In most windbreaks, chokecherry 
is a good shrub to be used in the outside rows.  Its dense 
growth makes it ideal for reducing wind near the ground 
surface.  Native  American  tribes  used  black  chokecherry 
for many medicinal uses. The chokecherry fruit was used 
for canker sores, sore throats, sore eyes, and diarrhea. The 
bark  of  the  plant  was  used  for  diarrhea  as  well.  Roots 
from  chokecherry  were  dried,  chewed,  and  placed  in

Description and Adaptation  
Black  chokecherry  is  a  native  colonizing,  horizontal 
branching, rhizomatous, perennial shrub and/or small tree.  
Its main stem system may be single or may have multiple 
stems  branching  at  the  base.    Twigs  are  slender  with 
prominent  red  to  white  lenticels.  the  bark  is  greenish  at 
first  and  later  becomes  reddish-brown.  As  the  shrub 
matures the bark becomes grey to black. The root system 
consists  of  shallow  rhizomes  which  contribute  to  its 
sprouting  and  rapid  colonization.    Leaves  are  alternate, 
simple,  glabrous  and  elliptic  ranging  from  2  –  4  inches 
long  and  1  -  2  inches  wide  with  serrate  margins.  At  the 
apex of the leaf petiole, two glands 1 – 2 centimeters long 
are  visible.  The  flowers  are  showy  white  aromatic 
racemes  with five petals. The corolla is one-half inch in 
diameter.  Mature  fruit,  approximately  one-third  inch  in 
diameter, are fleshy drupes that are dark red to black and 
possess  an  acidulous  taste.  The  fleshy  outer  layer  of  the 
fruit  is  nontoxic.  However,  poisoning  and  death  have 
occurred  in  children  who  have  consumed  large  amounts 
of  berries  without  removing  the  stones/seed.  The  stone 
possesses  high  levels  of  hydrogen  cyanide  (HCN)  or 
prussic  acid.  Seed  should  be  collected  in  mid-August  to 
mid-September.  
  
Black chokecherry is a large vigorous shrub, with mature 
plants reaching an average height of 12 feet and about 
13.5 feet wide.  Black chokecherry begins flowering in 
May and the fruit is ripe in mid to late August. It can be 
found throughout Canada, south to Georgia, west to New 
Mexico, and California at elevations ranging from 500 – 
10,000 feet. In Colorado it can be found at elevations of 
4500 – 9000 feet. This species can be found along 
streambanks, drainages, gullies, sheltered hill slopes, and 
canyon bottoms. It is well adapted to soil types that range 
from Entisols to Mollisols that have soil textures ranging 
from sandy loams to clays. It can tolerate moderately 
acidic (pH 3.5), moderately basic (pH 7.6) and weakly 
saline soils. However, it cannot tolerate soils that are 
poorly drained or suffer from prolonged flooding periods.  
It is well suited in sites that receive 12 to 30 inches of 
precipitation annually.

Establishment  
Black chokecherry can be established with seed planted 
about ¼ of an inch deep in the fall months or with 
container grown plants set in the ground in early spring 
when soil moisture is present. Sprouting does occur. 
Establishment can be slow, especially if soil moisture is 
low. New plantings can require several years (7 to 10) for 
flowering and seed production. Protection from browsing 
and plant competition along with the use of mulch will 
reduce the time required for establishment.  
  
Management   
After seeding or planting live plants, controlling wildlife 
browsing will be important for maintaining vigorous 
growth and fruit production. Reducing plant competition 
is also necessary for rapid plant growth. Once established, 
the plant can withstand moderate to heavy browsing in 
years with average to above average precipitation.

management may be required to control and maintain this 
plant species in an agronomic, horticultural or home 
landscaping application, but control practices are 
financially feasible and practical.  No specific 
management is anticipated in range or large landscape 
plantings where the species naturally occurs.  
  
Pests and Potential Problems  
The plant can occasionally be a host of ugly nest 
caterpillars. No other serious diseases or pests are known.  
  
Environmental Concerns  
Black  chokecherry  is  an  important  provider  of  food, 
shelter, nesting, and browse for wildlife. However, it has 
been  documented  that  livestock,  primarily  cattle  and 
sheep, are very susceptible to poisoning when grazing on 
black  chokecherry.  Lethal  doses  occur  when  an  animal 
ingests  0.25%  of  their  body  weight  in  an  hour  or  less. 
Black  chokecherry  produces  toxic  levels  of  hydrogen 
cyanide (HCN) or prussic acid in the plant’s bark, leaves, 
stems, and stone/seed pit. HCN is produced enzymatically 
from  cyanogenic  glycosides  when  plant 
is 
fragmented  during  mastication,  rumination,  and  frost 
damage.  Leaves  of  chokecherry  are  especially  toxic  in 
spring  and  summer,  but  poisoning  is  not  likely  to  occur 
then because the chokecherry is not relished by cattle and 
sheep when more palatable forage is abundant.

LANCE SELFHEAL 
Prunella vulgaris L. ssp. 
lanceolata (W. Bartram) Hultén 
Plant Symbol = PRVUL2 
Contributed by: USDA NRCS Corvallis Plant Materials 
Center, Oregon 
 
Photo by Amy Bartow, Corvallis Plant Materials Center, 2010 
Alternative Names 
Alternate Common Names: mountain selfheal, narrowleaf 
selfheal, lanceleaf selfheal, American self-heal, self heal, 
heal-all, all heal 
Alternate Scientific Names:  Prunella vulgaris L. var. 
elongata Benth., Prunella vulgaris L. var. lanceolata (W. 
Bartram) Fernald, Prunella pennsylvanica Willd. var. 
lanceolata W.P.C.Barton, Prunella vulgaris var. calvescens 
Uses 
Ornamental: Lance selfheal can be used as a native 
groundcover or alternative lawn that will generally stay 
green all summer in the Pacific Northwest without 
watering and will flower even when mowed fairly short.  
Plants will form a dense mat with small leaves when 
repeatedly mowed or grazed.  This species is also a 
valuable addition to a wildflower meadow or butterfly 
garden, but can become weedy, so it may not be 
appropriate for small spaces or formal gardens. 
Wildlife and pollinators: Flowers provide nectar and 
pollen to butterflies such as whites (Pierinae), sulfurs 
(Coliadinae), and skippers (Hesperiidae), as well as native 
bees such as bumblebees (Bombus spp.), digger bees 
(Anthophora spp.), small carpenter bees (Ceratina spp.), 
long-horned bees (Eucera spp.), and green sweat bees 
(Agapostemon spp.).  Caterpillars of the gray marvel moth 
(Agriopodes teratophora) sometimes feed on the foliage.  
 
Due to its bitter taste, lance selfheal is not generally eaten 
by herbivorous mammals, but the plants may be 
incidentally eaten by cattle, sheep, or deer along with 
pasture grasses.  Ground-foraging birds sometimes eat the 
nutlets. 
Erosion control: Due to its fibrous, rhizomatous roots and 
spreading growth habit, lance selfheal can be used for 
erosion control along roadsides, streambanks and pond 
edges.  The species also has potential as a perennial cover 
crop to provide habitat for pollinators and other beneficial 
insects in vineyards, orchards, and cane fruit or blueberry 
plantations, but more testing is needed. 
Ethnobotanic/medicinal: This plant was used medicinally 
by many North American tribes, giving rise to the 
common names used today. The Quileute, Quinault, and 
Coast Salish in the Pacific Northwest rubbed the juice 
from the plant on boils to heal them.  The Delaware, 
Mohegan and Iroquois made a drink or body wash of 
plant tops to reduce fevers.  The Nuxalk boiled the entire 
plant to make a weak tea that was taken for the heart.  
Studies have shown that P. vulgaris has antibiotic 
properties, lowers blood pressure, and contains a 
compound (ursolic acid) that is believed to increase 
urination and fight tumors.  It is still used as a medicinal 
herb today, but plants are known to concentrate lead 
compounds and other pollutants, so they should not be 
gathered from roadsides. 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
Weediness 
This plant may become weedy or invasive in some 
regions or habitats and may outcompete, displace, or 
overrun desirable vegetation if not properly managed.  
Prunella vulgaris (no subspecies specified) is listed in 
Weeds of the Northeast and Weeds of the Great Plains.  
Please consult with your local NRCS Field Office, 
Cooperative Extension Service office, state natural 
resource, or state agriculture department regarding its 
status and use.   
Description and Adaptation 
Lance selfheal is a native, fibrous-rooted, herbaceous 
perennial that grows from short rhizomes or an enlarged 
stem-base, reaching 4 to 20 inches tall.  Like other 
members of the mint family (Lamiaceae), it has square 
stems and opposite leaves.  The stems are generally un-
branched, slightly hairy above, and may be solitary or 
clustered.  Leaves are lance-shaped, 0.8 to 2.8 inches 
long, minutely hairy to hairless, with short stalks on lower 


Page 2
 
leaves, and smooth or slightly toothed margins.  The 
numerous, small (about ½ inch), purple to pink or white 
snapdragon-like flowers have short stalks and are tubular 
in shape, with a large, hooded upper lip and a large, 3-
lobed lower lip that is sometimes fringed.  They are 
arranged in a tight cluster 1 to 2 inches long by about 1 
inch wide at the end of the stem.  Within the cluster, the 
flowers are arranged in whorls of sixes, with each whorl 
above two spreading, pointed, leaf-like bracts.  Flowers 
bloom progressively in the spike from the lower to upper 
end.  Bloom occurs April to September, depending on the 
latitude and elevation.  Each flower produces four 
smooth, egg-shaped, one-seeded nutlets that are retained 
in the persistent calyx.  The nutlets are primarily 
distributed by flowing water, grazing mammals and birds. 
Prunella vulgaris ssp. vulgaris in an introduced species 
from Eurasia.  It is now naturalized throughout much of 
the same range as the North American native ssp. 
lanceolata.  The two can be distinguished by their growth 
form and the shape of the leaves growing along the 
middle of the stems: ssp. lanceolata grows upright or 
reclining on the ground with tips ascending and its mid-
stem leaves are narrower (about 3 times as long as wide), 
while ssp. vulgaris generally lies flat on the ground and 
has wider mid-stem leaves (twice as long as wide). 
Lance selfheal is an early successional species commonly 
found in moist, often disturbed areas including forest 
edges, open woodlands, meadows, pasturelands, 
roadsides, clearings and lawns at elevations below 8000 
ft.  It grows best in full sun to partial shade and moist soil.  
It is native to North America and its distribution is 
circumboreal, including most of the Northern 
Hemisphere.  For updated distribution, please consult the 
Plant Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
site.  
 
Lance selfheal distribution from USDA-NRCS PLANTS Database. 
Establishment 
Lance selfheal establishes easily from seed, having high 
germination rates at most temperatures, with no 
pretreatment necessary.  There are about 756,000 seeds 
per pound.  The recommended single-species seeding rate 
for pollinator enhancement plantings is 2 to 4 lbs/acre, 
while the recommended rate in a mix for prairie 
restoration is 2 to 8 ounces per acre.  Plants can also be 
propagated by dividing and planting out rhizomes in the 
spring. 
Management 
For seed production, fields are direct sown and the first 
seed harvest occurs in the second year after planting.  A 
small percentage of plants will flower the first year, 
especially if they are fall sown.  Large fields can be direct 
combined, while smaller production fields are generally 
swathed and collected to dry on tarps.  In seed production 
fields, plants usually die after harvest.  In the wild, plants 
are typically short-lived but readily self-sow. 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Information is lacking on pests and diseases associated 
with lance selfheal. 
Environmental Concerns 
Plants can become weedy or invasive and may displace 
other desirable vegetation if not managed.  Plants can 
regenerate from rhizome or shoot fragments, and the seed 
can persist in cultivated soil for at least 5 years. 
Control 
A surface application of lime may help control selfheal 
infestations on pastures with poor soils.  Please contact 
your local agricultural extension specialist or county weed 
specialist to learn what works best in your area and how 
to use it safely.  Always read label and safety instructions 
for each control method.   
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
There are no developed cultivars of lance selfheal, but 
both non-certified and certified source identified seed is 
available from commercial sources.  Container plants are 
also sometimes available from native plant nurseries.

Thinning: Douglas-fir responds well to thinning at an 
early age or until the trees reach pole and small 
sawlog size.  The method of thinning becomes more 
important in the sawlog stands.  For the thinning 
response to be good and the danger from tipover and 
breakage low, care should be taken to leave the stand 
in a thrifty condition.  During most thinning 
operations, it is desirable to remove some dominant,

not over-cut the trees in the dominant and 
codominant classes. 
Pruning: Trees prune well and heal over quickly if

grass with an extensive root system with strong 
tillers.  Bluebunch wheatgrass spreads by seed, 
except in high rainfall zones where some short 
rhizomes may occur. 
Bluebunch wheatgrass is highly variable and grows 
to 1.5 to 4 feet tall and seed spikes are 3 to 8 inches 
long.  The auricles (ear-shaped appendages where 
leaf blade and sheath meet) are pointed and semi-
clasping to nearly lacking.  Leaves are lax, flat to 
inrolled, 4-6 mm wide and green to blue in color.  
Leaf sheaths are generally smooth and hairless.  
Reproductive stems are erect, slender, sometimes 
wiry with a wavy floral stalk.  Seeds have a bristle or 
awn, except on the beardless type where the awn is 
lacking.

palatable to all classes of livestock and wildlife.  It is 
a preferred feed for cattle, horses, sheep, elk, deer

spring the protein levels can be as high as 20 percent 
and decrease to about 4 percent protein as the grass 
matures.  Digestible carbohydrates remain about 45 
percent throughout the active growth period.  
Erosion control/reclamation: Bluebunch wheatgrass 
is very drought resistant, stands are persistent, and it 
is adapted to stabilization of disturbed soils.  It is 
very compatible with slower developing natives such 
as thickspike and western wheatgrasses, and 
needlegrass species.  It does not compete well with 
aggressive introduced grasses.  Its drought tolerance, 
extensive root systems, and good seedling vigor 
make this species ideal for reclamation in areas 
receiving 10 to 20 inches annual precipitation.  This 
grass can be used in urban areas where irrigation 
water is limited and to stabilize ditchbanks, dikes, 
and roadsides as a mix component.

areas, the seeding rate should be increased to 40 to 50 
PLS per square foot.  Seedlings are weaker than 
crested wheatgrass and a clean firm weed free 
seedbed is required for establishment (cheatgrass 
competition can cause stand failure). 
Seed in very early spring on heavy to medium 
textured soils and in late fall on medium to light 
textured soils.  Late summer (August - mid 
September) seeding is not recommended unless 
irrigation is available.  Dormant fall seedings will

wheatgrass is fairly high and stands can easily be 
overgrazed.  Spring grazing should occur no more 
than one out of three years and no more than 40 
percent utilization should occur during rapid growth.  
Heavy early spring grazing is especially damaging 
and grazing should be delayed  
until flowers are halfway emerging from the 
protecting leaf.  No more than 60 percent utilization

Antelope bitterbrush is an important native browse 
shrub in the intermountain Western United States. It 
is adapted to a wide range of soils with 8 to 34 inches 
of annual precipitation and occurs at elevations of 
4000 to 8500 feet, but has been noted at 11,000 feet 
in California. The shrub is slow growing with a 
moderate to very deep root system and wide ecotypic 
variations. It is normally 2 to 6 feet in height and up 
to 8 feet in width with wedge shaped, three lobed 
leaves (some are persistent in winter). Branches near 
the soil may layer (branches that touch the soil 
develop roots) providing additional rooting for the 
plant. Flowering occurs in late spring to early 
summer with yellow to white blossoms.

' WHERE symbol='putr2';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD fs_ TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_='Management 
Since antelope bitterbrush is a very palatable shrub 
for big game and livestock, its use should be 
controlled or it can be easily eliminated by over use. 
The shrub is most often used by big game in the fall, 
winter, or early spring when other plants are still 
covered by snow. Stands of bitterbrush can become 
decadent with no use and mature plants should be 
browsed for good forage production and vigor. 
However, no more than 50 to 60 percent of current 
annual growth should be removed. The literature 
indicates that bitterbrush is not a fire resistant shrub, 
but is fire dependent and light to moderate fires may 
enhance stands.

the crushed flowers or leaves emit a minty scent. Like 
other mints, it has a four angled stem and small opposite 
leaves. The stem is smooth, without hairs, and is slender 
and stiff. The plant has a taproot and rhizomes. 
 
The pale green leaves are approximately 0.15–0.6 in wide 
and 0.5–2 in long. They are smooth or minutely hairy on 
the uppermost leaves. The upper leaves are stalkless while 
the lowest leaves have short stems. There are short leafy 
branches in the axils. 
 
The plant has profuse clusters of small, tubular, white 
flowers which bloom in the middle of summer. July 
through August. The flower petals have an upper lip, and 
three-lobed lower lip. Clusters stagger their bloom period 
over a long period of time. It is thought that pollinators 
prefer this species because the florets  are tightly 
clustered, have short corolla tubes, and are white (Tooker 
et al,. 2002). 
 
Adaptation:P. tenuifolium grows in dry to medium wet 
soils and in full sun to partial shade. It can be found in 
rocky ground in open prairies and upland woods, as well 
as in low areas, wet thickets, pine barrens, oak woods, and 
on the edges of wooded areas. Gleason and Cronquist

White oak is generally classified as intermediate in 
its tolerance to shade.  Its tolerance decreases as a 
tree becomes older and larger.  Thinning combined 
with fertilization can boost diameter growth.  White 
oak usually becomes dominant because of its ability 
to persist for long periods of time in the understory, 
its ability to respond well after thinning, and its great 
longevity.  Even-aged silviculture is most suitable if 
oaks are growing in pure or mixed hardwood stands.  
Reducing both overstory and understory competition 
is likely to accelerate the growth of seedlings.

Uses 
Windbreaks and Shelterbelts:  Bur oak is recommended as 
a medium to tall component in windbreak and shelterbelt 
systems.  Although modest in growth rate, especially in 
the western U.S., it is a strong-wooded and long lived 
species. 
 
Riparian Forest Buffers:  Bur oak can be used in riparian 
forest buffer plantings and may be a suitable substitute, 
depending on site conditions, for green ash (Fraxinus 
pennsylvanica) and Russian olive (Elaeagnus 
angustifolia).   
 
Woody Draw Restoration:  Bur oak is a natural 
component of woody draws in the central and western 
Great Plains.  Seedlings grown in containers are preferred 
over bareroot stock and direct sowing. 
 
Timber:  The wood of bur oak is quite valuable and is 
often marketed as “white oak.”  It is used in the 
 
 
 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
manufacture of cabinets, barrels, hardwood flooring, and 
fence posts. 
 
Ornamental:  Bur oak makes an excellent landscape 
specimen, and is well suited to drought tolerant 
landscapes.  Its strong branches make it a good choice for 
street trees provided it has ample space to accommodate 
its wide spreading basal branches.   
 
Wildlife:  Bur oak is an excellent source of food for many 
wildlife species including deer, turkeys, squirrels, rabbits, 
raccoons, and rodents.  As it reaches maturity it provides 
roosting, loafing, and nesting for numerous species of 
birds. 
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
 
Description 
Bur oak or mossycup oak is a medium- to tall-stature 
deciduous tree widely distributed across the United States.  
Bur oak has several desirable attributes including strong 
branches, drought tolerance, winter hardiness, and 
freedom from serious insects or diseases.  
 
On good sites, bur oak has a spreading habit with a broad 
crown. massive bole. and low, large branches.  It is 
capable of reaching heights over 80 feet and individual 
trees up to 100 feet are found on good sites.  At the far 
western edge of its range, heights of 50 feet can be 
considered about the upper limits of growth. 
 
Adaptation and Distribution 
Bur oak has a large native range extending from Nova 
Scotia, west to Manitoba, south through Kansas to Texas, 
east to Alabama, and northeast to Virginia and New 
England.  Landscape specimens can be found in many 
western states outside of its native range.  Most 
references list bur oak as hardy in  
USDA Winter Hardiness Zones 4 to 8, although Zone 2 is 
given in at least one source.  Bur oak is considered only 
moderately shade tolerant. 
 
Although favoring rich alluvial bottomland, bur oak 
grows well on rocky hillsides, limestone soils, droughty 
soils, clayey sites, and other marginal sites -- given full 
sun conditions.  This species performed better than most 
others tested on coal-mine spoils of pH 5.6 in eastern 
Kansas.  In the western United States, bur oak is 
considered a pioneer species and is capable of invading

‘Lippert’ bur oak, released in 1994 by the Manhattan, 
Kansas Plant Materials Center, is a seed propagated 
cultivar recommended for conservation use in multi-row 
windbreaks, reforestation for watershed protection, and 
wildlife habitat plantings. 
 
‘Boomer’ bur oak was released by the James E “Bud” 
Smith Plant Materials Center in Knox City, Texas.  It is 
recommended for conservation use in windbreaks, as a 
landscape plant for urban and recreational areas, and for 
wildlife food and shelter. 
 
Ekalaka Germplasm bur oak is a Selected Class pre-
varietal selection of bur oak released by the Bridger, 
Montana Plant Materials Center in 2009 for improved rate 
of height growth, percentage seedling survival, and vigor 
rating.  It is recommended for various conservation 
applications such as windbreaks, shelterbelts, riparian 
forest buffers, Xeriscapes®
projects, and wildlife plantings.   
 
Bur oak seed is readily available through commercial seed 
sources in the central and western United States.  
Seedlings can be purchased from both state and 
commercial nurseries.  Foundation seed of Plant Materials 
Program selections is available by contacting the 
releasing Plant Materials Center or respective Plant

primarily along stream bottoms and stream terraces in 
association with green ash, boxelder (Acer negundo), and 
cottonwood (Populus sp.).  Bur oak is, however, 
intolerant of flooding.

Establishment 
Cross pollination between individual trees appears to be 
favored.  Acorns ripen in one year, falling as early as 
August or as late as November depending on the tree and 
location.  Acorns usually germinate immediately without 
pretreatment, but may require cold:moist stratification 
when collected from northern sources.  Average minimum 
seed-bearing age of forest trees is approximately 35 years 
with best production typically between 75 to 150 years.  
Good crops usually occur every two to three years.  It 
may be necessary to check seed-bearing trees regularly in 
order to assure harvesting the acorns before the wildlife 
do.  Under fallow, dryland conditions in Bridger, 
Montana, bur oak trees began producing substantial 
amounts of seed by 10 years of age. 
 
Bur oak is considered moderately tolerant to intolerant to 
shade.  Initial height growth is normally slow for the first 
three to five years, then moderate as the plant becomes 
established.  Seedlings produce a vigorous and aggressive 
taproot that allows this species to utilize sub-surface 
moisture and tolerate drought.  Container produced 
seedlings, cultivated in tall, narrow pots and at least two 
years of age are the preferred stock type. 
 
Management 
Protection from wildlife is highly recommended for all 
bur oak plantings as this species is preferred browse for 
deer and rabbits.  Its slow initial growth warrants the use 
of weed barrier or other forms of vegetation control for 
reducing plant competition.  Supplemental water may 
result in modest increases in seedling survival and 
biomass production on droughty sites.  Supplemental 
fertility is not considered necessary for most conservation 
plantings in the northern Great Plains and Intermountain 
West.  
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Reported insect problems include oak webworm, oak 
skeletonizer, leaf miner, variable oakleaf caterpillar, oak 
lacebug, and June beetles.  Oak lacebug can be a serious 
problem in shelterbelt plantings, especially during 
drought conditions.  Serious insect and disease problems 
are relatively limited for bur oak in the western United 
States.

Alternative Names 
Common Names:  forage radish, fodder radish, tillage 
radish®, radish ripper, daikon, Japanese radish 
 
Scientific Names:  Raphanus sativus var.oleifer Stokes, 
Raphanus sativus L. ssp. Oleiferus, Raphanus sativus L. 
var. oleiformis Pers.  
Uses 
Cover Crop: Oilseed radish is a cover crop planted in 
early fall or after harvest of the primary crop. Planting 
occurs after the harvest of cash crops such as wheat, rye, 
early potatoes, pickling cucumbers, snap beans, or celery. 
It can also be aerial seeded into standing corn, soybean, or 
cotton prior to harvest. Oilseed radish has a uniquely deep 
taproot, which can reach a depth of six feet. It develops an 
enlarged upper portion of the taproot, which can reach 12 
to 20 inches in length and 2 inches in diameter. This deep-
rooting growth habit is capable of treating multiple 
resource concerns on cropland such as: 
 
Soil Compaction: The thick taproot penetrates compacted 
soil layers. The root decomposes in the spring and leaves 
large, deep holes in the soil. These holes enable water, air, 
and cash crop roots to penetrate the soil in the summer 
when the soil is dry and hard. Planting oilseed radish is an 
alternative to using machinery to deeply rip or plow the 
soil, and can be used by farmers with no-till systems. 
 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
Nitrate leaching: The deep taproot can scavenge nitrogen 
in the soil left by the previous crop. The roots of oilseed 
radish absorb nitrogen at greater depths than other crops 
and keep it from leaching into the groundwater. When the 
plant decomposes in the spring, nitrogen is released back 
to the cash crop.   
 
Weed Management: Oilseed radish seedlings can emerge 
as soon as 3 days after planting (if conditions are 
favorable), and can quickly grow and suppress weeds. 
Biomass decomposes quickly and may leave the seedbed 
ready for planting, without the need to till leftover 
residue. 
Pest Management: Like other plants in the Brassicaceae 
(mustard) family, the roots of oilseed radish exude 
chemicals that help suppress soil pests like nematodes. 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
Weediness 
To prevent oilseed radish from becoming a weed pest, kill 
the crop before plants produce seed. Seeds may remain 
viable in the soil for multiple growing seasons, and can 
germinate when the cash crop is growing. This plant may 
become weedy or invasive in some regions or habitats and 
may displace desirable vegetation if not properly 
managed. Please consult with your local NRCS Field 
Office, Cooperative Extension Service office, state natural 
resource, or state agriculture department regarding its 
status and use. Weed information is also available from 
the PLANTS Web site at http://plants.usda.gov/. Please 
consult the Related Web Sites on the Plant Profile for this 
species for further information. 
Description and Adaptation 
Oilseed radish is a coarse winter annual in the 
Brassicaceae (or Cruciferae) family. Leaves grow in a 
basal rosette to 2-3 feet tall. Seed stalks elongate from the 
rosette. Pink, white, or lavender flowers bloom in spring.  
The Brassicaceae family also produces edible crops such 
as broccoli and cabbage. Oilseed radish differs from 
typical radish because it develops a thick, white taproot 
that can grow 1-2 inches in diameter and up to 1 foot in 
length. Plants give off a foul “rotten egg-like” odor when 
they decompose in the spring.  
 
Oilseed radish grows best in cool, moist growing 
conditions (most often during the fall). Plants are not

tolerant of shade, standing water, or severely nitrogen-
deficient soils. Plants cannot survive freezing 
temperatures of 20⁰F or below. 
 
 
 
 
Oilseed radish distribution from USDA-NRCS PLANTS Database. 
For updated distribution, please consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
Establishment 
Prepare a clean, firm, weed-free seedbed prior to planting 
oilseed radish. Adjust planting times according to the first 
expected frosts. Oilseed radish will die or sustain damage 
if temperatures drop below 20⁰F. In the Mid-Atlantic, 
planting times are generally late August or early 
September. Use the small grain box (seed is similar in 
size to alfalfa) on a conventional or no-till drill. It is 
suggested that you plant a minimum of 6-10 lb/acre of 
pure live seed (PLS). Planting depth should be ¼ to ½ 
inch. Drilling yields more successful stands, but seed can 
also be broadcast at a higher rate of 12-14 PLS lb/acre. 
Follow broadcast seeding with a light disking, 
cultipacking, or rolling with water-filled roller. Aerial 
seeding can be done on standing crops. Increase seeding 
rates to 14-16 PLS lb/acre and broadcast into standing 
corn or soybean canopies when lower leaves begin to turn 
yellow. Cotton crops can be aerially seeded prior to 
defoliation and harvest.  
Management 
Oilseed radish establishes quickly if soil moisture is 
adequate (soil moisture varies by soil texture). Plants will 
scavenge leftover nitrogen in the soil profile and do not 
need additional fertilization. The most important 
management consideration when planting oilseed radish is 
ensuring that plants do not go to seed. When the taproots 
decompose, a foul rotten-egg or natural gas-like odor is 
emitted. 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Avoid planting oilseed radish as a cover crop when the 
cash crop includes broccoli, cabbage, radish, or other 
members of the mustard family because it can encourage 
the establishment of some pathogens and pests. Rotate 
other cover crop species with oilseed radish to avoid pest 
and pathogen problems.  
 
Control/Cover Crop Termination 
Oilseed radish must be killed prior to planting of the cash 
crop to allow cash crop germination. Oilseed radish will 
naturally die in winter conditions/frost when temperatures 
fall below 20°F and decompose naturally in the soil.  
If plants do not winterkill, mowing, grazing, lightly 
disking, or spraying with appropriate herbicide treatment 
is recommended at flowering before seed set. Please 
contact your local agricultural extension specialist or 
county weed specialist to learn what works best in your 
area and how to use it safely. Always read label and 
safety instructions for each control method. Trade names 
and control measures appear in this document only to 
provide specific information.  USDA NRCS does not 
guarantee or warranty the products and control methods 
named, and other products may be equally effective. 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
Seeds are available from select commercial sources, but 
can be more expensive than many other cover crop 
species. There are several trademark varieties in the 
United States, including Tillage Radish® and 
Groundhog™. Many cultivars including ‘Adagio’, 
‘Arena’, ‘Colonel’, ‘Remonta’ ‘Revena’, ‘Rimbo’, and 
‘Ultimo’ have European origins. Commercially available 
“common” varieties are also sold under ‘VNS’ for variety 
not stated.

Uses: The fruit is an important winter food for birds, 
including turkeys, ruffed grouse, robins and flickers, and 
for various small mammals. The foliage is relatively

Fragrant sumac root was used by Native Americans to 
produce a yellow dye, and the berries in an acidic tasting 
beverage. The Cheyenne dried leaves of fragrant sumac 
and mixed them with tobacco, red willow dogwood and 
bearberry to make a smoking mixture. The leaves and 
bark were used for tanning leather because of the high 
tannin content of these plants. The Native American tribes 
also used the sumac’s astringent power to stop bleeding in 
all forms from wounds to hemorrhage after child birth. It

Description and Adaptation 
 
 
Figure 2. Fragrant sumac distribution from USDA-
NRCS PLANTS Database. 
Description: Fragrant sumac belongs to the 
Anacardiaceae family. A straggling to upright native 
shrub 6 to 8 feet tall rarely tree like in appearance. This 
shrub occurs singly or in dense thickets that may be 
connected by rhizomes. Root systems are deep and 
extensively branched. Plants are deciduous, woody, 
spreading, often forming clumps or thickets. Crown 
diameter often exceeds height and may be more that 30 
feet across. Stems are numerous, woody, spreading, 
highly branched, and brown and pubescent when young, 
but develop a gray bloom with age. Leaves are 1 to 3 
inches long, trifoliate, petiolate, and puberulant beneath. 
Leaves are alternate and compound with three leaflets 
which are variable in shape, lobing, and margins. Plants 
of fragrant sumac are polygamo-dioecious, thus 
functionally dioecious, but having a few perfect flowers 
on an otherwise staminate or pistillate plant. Flowers are 
yellow in small dense inflorescences on short lateral 
shoots, male (staminate) flowers in yellowish catkins, 
female (pistillate) flowers in bright yellow, short panicles 
at the branches ends. Fruits are orange red, sticky, berry

like drupe containing a single bony seed. Leaves are 
fragrant or at least odorous. 
Adaptation: Fragrant sumac grows in a range of sites 
including open rocky woodlands, valley bottoms, lower 
rocky slopes, and roadsides. The plants are hardy and can 
grow in sun or partial shade. It flowers in March to May, 
usually before the leaves expand, and produces densely 
hairy, drupe like fruits in June to August 
For updated distribution, please consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
Establishment 
Fruits can be harvested in the summer and early fall. Fruit 
of Rhus aromatic is synchronous and does not support a 
staggered fruit ripening pattern. Fruits are collected by 
hand or by flailing the stems after leaf drop in the fall.  
Harvested seed are macerated and flushed with water to 
remove pulp and debris. The remaining materials, 
including the seeds, are dried and fanned to remove loose 
debris. There are approximately 20,000 cleaned seeds per 
pound. Recommended standards of seed for purchase is 
40 percent germination and 95 percent purity. Cleaned 
seed can remain viable under cool, dry storage for up to 
five years. Seed germination is restricted by a hard 
impervious seed coat and embryo dormancy. Erratic seed 
germination is a factor in this shrub not being more 
extensively planted. Both forms of dormancy vary widely 
among seed lots. Seedcoat permeability may be increased 
by a 20 minute to 2 hour sulfuric acid scarification. A wet 
prechill for 30 to 120 days is required to release embryo 
dormancy. Embryo dormancy can also be broken in 
fragrant sumac by treatment with gibberellic acid (GA3) 
at 500 to 1000 parts per million (ppm) concentrations.  
Management 
Seedlings grow moderately well, but young plants are not 
highly competitive with herbaceous plants. Scarified seed 
should be planted in the fall to provide a wet cool 
stratification period. scarified seed planted in the spring 
must have a cold, wet period or be treated with GA3. 
Seed should be planted at a ½ inch depth in a dry, course 
textured soil. Seeding rates of 2 to 4 pounds per acre are 
recommended depending on row spacing. It may be 
broadcast on rough surfaces or in pits. If drilled the seed 
should be planted with other slow growing shrub species 
that provide some distance from aggressive fast growing 
species. In the bareroot nursery trade seed should be 
planted ½ inch deep. A seeding density of 25 viable seed 
units per linear foot of row is recommended. Beds should 
be mulched to prevent excessive drying. Plants may be 
lifted as 1-0 or 2-0 stock, depending on their growth rate. 
Field transplanted seedlings should be at least 8 to 11 
inches tall. Established seedlings are hardy and resilient.  
 
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
The species is susceptible to vascular wilt caused by 
Fusarium oxysporum. A sumac feeding psyllid (Calophya 
triozomiwa) has been collected on fragrant sumac in many 
locations. 
Control 
Please contact your local agricultural extension specialist 
or county weed specialist to learn what works best in your 
area and how to use it safely.  Always read label and 
safety instructions for each control method.  Trade names 
and control measures appear in this document only to 
provide specific information.  USDA NRCS does not 
guarantee or warranty the products and control methods 
named, and other products may be equally effective. 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
Fragrant sumac can be found in the commercial nursery 
trade. ‘Konza’ is a 1980 release from the Manhattan Plant 
Materials Center in Manhattan, KS. Konza was a 
cooperative release with the Kansas Agricultural 
Experiment Station, Nebraska Agricultural Experiment 
Station, Nebraska Game and Parks Commission and the 
Kansas Fish and Game Commission. The original 
germplasm for the release was collected on a limestone 
breaks site south of Manhattan, KS. After initial 
evaluation and selection at the Manhattan PMC, it was 
field tested in Oklahoma, Nebraska, and Kansas for over 
10 years. Konza proved to be superior in growth form, 
disease resistance, adaptability and wildlife cover 
potential over other similar standards of comparison.

from July to September.  Fruits mature later in the 
fall. The fruiting head is a compact cluster of round, 
red, hairy fruits called drupes.  Each drupe measures 
¼ inch in diameter and contains one seed.  Each 
cluster of drupes may contain 100 to 700 seeds.  Fruit 
is produced on plants 3 to 4 years old.  Because most 
populations of sumac have male and female flowers 
on separate plants, only the female plants produce 
seed.  Occasionally, plants are found which have both 
male and female flowers.  The germination of sumac 
seeds is enhanced by their passage through the 
digestive system of rabbits, ring-necked pheasants, 
and quail.  The presence of fire also encourages 
increased germination.  There are about 60,000 seeds

Plant Fact Sheet
The golden currant is a widespread species that is the 
alternate host for the pine blister rust fungus. this has 
caused the species to be a target for eradication in areas 
where white pine is of economic and commercial value.   
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
Description and Adaptation

currant from the PLANTS Database website. Photo by 
D.E. Herman, USDA-NRCS Plants database. 
 
Alternate Names 
Buffalo currant, fragrant golden currant, golden flowering 
currant, clove currant, wild currant, clove bush 
Uses 
Golden currant has been widely planted for wildlife 
habitat, ground cover, watershed protection, and in 
conservation plantings. Golden currant is a highly 
preferred spring and midsummer browse for big game 
with only moderate summer and light fall grazing by big 
game animals. Golden currant is an excellent species for 
stabilization of roadways and other disturbances, 
particularly when transplanted stock is utilized. Both bare 
root and containerized plants will establish well on 
disturbed sites. Golden currant is also widely used for 
hedges, windbreaks and in conservation and landscape 
plantings. It is usually planted in combination with other 
woody species. This species is also planted in hedges or 
rows to provide berries for jam and jelly production. 
Some Native American tribes used currants for making 
pemmican. a high protein, high energy food made with 
meat, fat and fruit in a dry, edible form.  
Status 
 
Figure 2. Golden currant distribution from USDA-
NRCS PLANTS Database. 
Golden currant belongs to the Grossulariaceae or currant 
family. Golden currant is an unarmed, irregularly shaped, 
multi-stemmed shrub 3 to 10 feet tall that spreads by 
suckering. The reddish bark of young twigs turns gray 
with age. Leaves are simple, alternate, deciduous, and 
petiolate. Leaf blades are ovate with a cuneate to chordate 
base, usually glaborous, and palmately three lobed with 
the lobes being entire, toothed, or lobed. In May, either 
before or as leaves appear, golden currant produces many 
racemes of ¾ to 1 inch long yellow tubular flowers that 
emit a pleasant clove or spicy odor. The cylindrical 
hypanthium consists of five spreading calyx lobes 
alternating with five shorter erect petals. The perfect 
flowers are initially golden yellow, but turn reddish with 
age. The edible fruit is a globose, glabrous, many seeded 
berry. Fruit colors vary from yellow, to red orange to 
black. The large fruit, up to ½ inch in diameter, is 
excellent for human and wildlife consumption. The 
minute embryo is embedded in a large amount of 
endosperm.                                                                
Golden currant is generally not widely abundant, but it

corridors along waterways and fence rows. It normally 
grows on fertile, well drained sites such as moist 
streambanks, washes, ditches, seeps and springs. While 
considered a species of moist sites, golden currant is also 
found on well-drained soils that only receive 16 inches of 
precipitation annually. Plants generally grow in full sun to 
partial shade on soils ranging from slightly acidic to 
slightly basic. Golden currant is moderately fire tolerant 
and recovers by resprouting or natural seeding.

Establishment 
Fruits are hand harvested by stripping them from branches 
or by flailing them into containers as soon as they ripen. 
Few wild land stands are large enough to produce much 
seed. Collection of 100 pounds of fruit will only yield 
about 4 pounds of usable seed. Thus, seed collection costs 
are high and limit the use of this shrub in large scale 
plantings. Fruits are processed by maceration in water to 
separate the fruit pulp from the seed. Pulp and empty 
seeds are separated from sound seeds by floatation. There 
are 200,000 to 285,000 seeds per pound. Seed viability is 
normally quite high, usually in excess of 75 percent. Seed 
germination can be hastened and increased by a long 
period of cold, moist stratification. A wet prechill of 60 to 
90 days at 28 to 36 degrees Fahrenheit (°F) is often 
sufficient to reduce embryo dormancy. Seeds retain good 
viability for 5 to 17 years if stored cool and dry in sealed 
containers.   
Management 
Seeds should be fall planted to provide a cold, moist 
period for maximum germination. Seeds are small, round, 
and easily dispersed by most seeders. Golden currant can 
be seeded alone or more commonly in mixtures with other 
woody shrub and forb species. Seeds are usually sown at 
a rate of 0.25 to 2.0 pounds per acre depending on 
mixture components, method of seeding and row spacing.  
In a nursery setting, seeds are usually sown at a rate of 60 
to 80 seeds per square foot or 40 viable seed units per 
linear foot of row. Seed should be planted 0.25 inches 
deep on a firm, weed free seed bed. Adding mulch to the 
soils surface is recommended for nursery beds subject to 
rapid drying and crusting of the soil surface. Seeds that 
germinate often due so uniformly and initial emergence is 
usually very good even under range or wild land 
conditions.  Compared with most shrubs, seedlings of 
golden currant are very persistent. Seedlings grow rapidly 
and generally attain heights of 6 to 12 inches the first year 
of growth. Seedlings of few other shrubs are as vigorous 
as this species.  
Bareroot or containerized transplants can be quickly 
grown. Planting beds are normally thinned to the correct 
spacing and density. One year old transplants develop a 
 
dense, well branched root system, and field survival of   
1-0 transplants is usually high. Transplants establish well 
on harsh disturbed sites due, in part to their well 
developed root system. Container stock is grown from 
seed or hardwood or softwood cuttings.  
Pests and Potential Problems 
Currants are subject to defoliation by western tent 
caterpillars and they are the alternate host for white pine 
blister rust (Cronartium ribicola). A bacterial spot 
(Pseudamonas syringae pathovar ribicola) can cause 
severe defoliation of golden currant and necrotic spots to 
form on leaves, shoots and fruit. 
Control 
Please contact your local agricultural extension specialist 
or county weed specialist to learn what works best in your 
area and how to use it safely.  Always read label and 
safety instructions for each control method.  Trade names 
and control measures appear in this document only to 
provide specific information.  USDA NRCS does not 
guarantee or warranty the products and control methods 
named, and other products may be equally effective. 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
These plants are readily available from commercial 
sources. The cultivar ‘Crandall’ was discovered by R.W. 
Crandall of Newton, Kansas and introduced into 
commercial production by Frank Ford and Sons, Nursery, 
Ravenna, Ohio, in 1888. Fruit of this clone is mild, sweet, 
pleasant, and very different from European black currants. 
It performs well in hot summers, is resistant to white pine 
blister rust, and shows little or no damage from powdery 
mildew in Idaho and Oregon trials.

species sprouting from seed or root crowns following 
fire. It is propagated by seed, cuttings or layering. 
Heavy seed crops occur every second or third year

There are approximately 284,000 seeds per pound. 
Seed is naturally distributed by birds and small

     PITCHER SAGE 
Salvia azurea  Michx. ex Lam. 
var. grandiflora Benth. 
Plant Symbol = SAAZG 
' WHERE symbol='saazg';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD fs_DescriptionandAdaptation TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_DescriptionandAdaptation='General: The Mint family (Lamiaceae). Pitcher sage 
is a long-lived, warm-season, herbaceous, native 
perennial species. The common name Pitcher sage 
comes from the name of Doctor Zina Pitcher, a 19th 
century U.S. Army field surgeon and amateur 
botanist. Each plant has one major stem or a few 
stems growing in a clump. It grows from 2 to 5 feet 
tall and the foliage is gray-green. The root system is 
branched and grows up to 8 feet deep. John Weaver, 
prairie ecologist, reported that pitcher sage could 
double its rooting depth as a response to extreme 
drought. Each stem is simple or may be branched 
near its terminal point. The stems, like those of many 
other mints, are square in cross section with opposite 
leaves. The foliage has a mint fragrance, but is much 
milder than many of the members of the mint family. 
The leaves are lance shaped and three to four inches 
long on the lower stem and become smaller as they 
ascend the stem. Lower leaves can be shed early in 
the growing season. Pitcher sage begins blooming in 
July and may bloom until early October. Light blue 
two-lipped flowers are borne in a series of dense 
clusters with 2 to 8 flowers in a cluster. Only a few 
flowers in a cluster are in bloom at any one time. The 
flower corollas are 1/2 to 1 inch in length. The 
enlarged, drooping lower lip of the flower is covered 
at the base by a short, stiff, upper lip or hood. A bee 
will land on the lower lip and force its way under the 
hood to reach the nectar glands at the base of the 
flower tube. As is common in other species of 
flowers, the anthers mature before the stigma is 
receptive to pollen, thus ensuring cross fertilization. 
The pollen bearing anther is on one end of a slender 
filament and a sterile anther is located on the other 
end. When the bee enters the flower tube, its head 
will push on the sterile anther. The filament, just like 
a seesaw, will pivot and dust the bees back with 
pollen from the fertile anther. The bee then visits 
other flowers, that are more mature, and pollinates a 
receptive stigma completing the act of cross 
pollination. The resulting fruits consist of one or two 
light brown, resin-dotted nutlets borne at the bottom 
of the persistent calyx tube. The nutletts are elliptical, 
flattened and approximately 1/8 inch long.  
 
Adaptation: Pitcher sage is easy to grow in a wide 
range of soil types that have dry to medium amounts 
of moisture. It prefers sandy to gravelly soils, and the 
number one consideration is for soils to be well 
drained, otherwise the roots are subject to root rot. 
This species tolerates heat, humidity and drought 
very well. Full sun is required for this plant to thrive,

UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_Description='Dwarf willow is a small to medium sized shrub 
growing only 6 to 8 feet high, with smooth, slender, 
tough, resilient branches that are lime green at first 
but later change to a darker green.  The cultivar, 
‘Bankers’ was introduced from the alpine region of 
West Germany in the mid-1960s.  This selection is a 
natural hybrid between Salix retusa L. and Salix 
myrsinifolia Salisb.  It is a sterile hybrid, therefore it 
produces no seed. 
‘Bankers’ is a semiprostrate shrub, sending up many 
branches from the roots to form a dense surface 
cover.  The roots themselves form an interlocking 
network to tie the soil together.  It rarely spreads by 
layering of branches.  Growth is rapid from cuttings, 
with plants reaching full height in 3 to 5 years.  
Plantings made on 2-foot centers can produce solid 
stands in 2 to 3 years.

In most cases a rate of 2 to 5 pounds per acre would 
be adequate in mixtures with other species.  For 
mined lands and other harsh critical areas, double the 
seeding rate component of small burnet.  The best 
seeding results are obtained from seeding in late fall 
to very early spring (because of grass component of 
mix) on heavy to medium textured soils and in late 
fall on medium to light textured soils.  Late summer 
(August - mid September) seeding is not 
recommended unless site is irrigated.  Mulching, 
irrigation and weed control all benefit stand 
establishment.  Seedling vigor is excellent, but the 
plant establishes slowly.  Germination normally 
occurs the first growing season if adequate moisture 
is available.  Full flowering should not be expected 
until at least the second growing season. 
Stands may require weed control measures during 
establishment.  Because small burnet is a broadleaf,

The name willow derives from the Old English wilwe.  
The botanical name Salix was the name given by the 
ancient Romans. 
 
Uses 
Ethnobotanic: The ancient Greeks knew the therapeutic 
values of willow.  Tea made from willow bark was used 
for stiff joints and rheumatic pains.  
By the 1840’s, chemists had isolated salicylic acid from 
willow and found it produced marked antipyretic (fever-
reducing) and analgesic (pain-killing) effects and 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
“striking relief of acute articular rheumatism.”  Modern 
aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is a synthetic product.  
Salicylic acid got its name from Salix. 
 
Industry: Most black willow lumber is used for shipping 
boxes.  
 
Wildlife: The willows are among the first plants to 
provide honey bees, after long winters, with nectar and 
pollen.  Domestic grazing animals browse in willow 
thickets.  Elk and beaver browse on willow leaves in the 
summer and willow twigs in the winter.   
 
Ornamental: Black willow can be planted as an 
ornamental where a fine-textured shade tree is desired.  It 
will tolerate dry soils with reduced vigor. 
 
Conservation:  One of the greatest services of the willows 
is as a soil-binder.  Growing along the banks of countless 
streams, their fibrous roots help to prevent the soil from 
being washed away.   
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g. threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values. 
 
Description and Adaptation 
A member of the Willow Family (Salicaceae), black 
willow is a small to medium-sized tree 30 to 60 ft high 
and about 14 inches in diameter with a broad, irregular 
crown and a superficial root system.  
 
Leaves are simple, alternate, deciduous, narrow, lance-
shaped, with tapered bases, rounded base, finely toothed 
margin, blade yellow-green on both sides, with a few 
small hairs on the lower surface. petiole slender.  Flowers 
of black willow: male and female catkins on separate 
trees. Catkins are 4-5 cm long, on ends of leafy shoots, 
many small, yellow-green flowers without petals.  Twigs 
are light-red, slender, and flexible.  Buds narrow, conical, 
orange-brown. leaf scars narrow, crescent shaped. broad, 
flat, often shaggy ridges. pith pale brown, small.  The 
bark is dark gray-brown to nearly blackish, divided into 
deep fissures separating thick, interlacing, sometimes 
scaly ridges. 
 
Black willow is adapted wherever ample soil moisture is 
found.  Black willow grows best where the average 
annual rainfall is 51 inches, of which 20 inches falls 
during the growing season, April through August.

Fire Effects 
Black willow is very susceptible to fire.  Hot fires can kill 
entire stands of willows.  Black willow will sprout at the 
base following fire.  
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) ‘Webb’ compact willow is a “strikingly 
different vase-shaped form of black willow.”  This 
unusual form was found by Mr. Charles Webb in Madison 
County, Florida.  
 
Control  
Please contact your local agricultural extension specialist 
or county weed specialist to learn what works best in your 
area and how to use it safely.  Always read label and 
safety instructions for each control method. USDA, 
NRCS does not guarantee or warranty the products and 
control methods named, and other products may be 
equally effective.

The estimated life span for black willow averages 65 
years with a range of 40 to 100 years. 
 
Wood characteristics: The wood is of moderately light to 
light density, moderately soft.  It does not splinter easily, 
which makes excellent wood for toys, crates, and barn 
floors.   
 
Distribution:  Black willow ranges from New Brunswick 
to Manitoba, south to Florida and Texas. 
 
 
Black willow distribution from USDA-NRCS PLANTS Database. 
 
Habitat:  This species is usually found on moist or wet 
soils along banks of streams, lakes, swamps around farm 
ponds, and pasture sloughs.   
 
Establishment  
Black willow is easily established from cuttings.  
Stringent requirements of seed germination and seedling 
establishment limit black willow to wet soils. 
 
Management 
Stands of black willow can stagnate if not periodically 
thinned.   
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
A number of insect species attack black willow but few 
cause serious damage, such as, forest tent caterpillar, 
cotton wood leaf beetle, willow sawfly, stem borers, and 
twig borers. 
 
Seeds and Plant Production  
Good seed crops occur almost every year with only a few 
interspersed poor crop years. The seeds are widely 
disseminated by wind and water.  Willow seed must be 
collected as soon as it ripens and sown immediately.  
Stem cuttings are highly desirable to propagate trees.

short stalks. the terminal leaflet is on a longer stalk. 
Numerous 1/4&quot. fragrant white flowers, emerge from 
late June into August.  The terminal clusters of 
flowers, measuring 4&quot.-10&quot. across, are broad, flat or 
slightly rounded and long-stalked.  Flowers usually 
develop in the second-year on older canes, and are 
arranged in branched clusters of 5. 
Fruits ripen from late July into September.  They are 
round, slightly bitter, edible purple-black berries with 
crimson juice.  Each is less than 1/4&quot. across, borne in 
large clusters.  Each berry contains 3-5 small seeds.  
Seed dispersal occurs from July to October, usually

Soil Bioengineering Uses:   Streamco  purpleosier 
willow is the premier source of materials for these 
practices.   Streamco  provides the best combination 
of growth, stem density, flexibility, and toughness of 
any willow tested for these uses.  Dormant whips are 
very useful when bundled into wattles (live fascines) 
or for brush layering and mattressing systems.  Stem 
sections work well in live staking systems, and larger 
diameter (1 1/2-2 inches) older stems are useful in 
pole applications.  ‘Streamco’ willow can be 
produced in the nursery to specification to meet all 
the above uses.  Planting methods for soil 
bioengineering are regionally varied.  Consult with 
the Plant Materials Specialist for planting 
recommendations.  Other species can be added to 
plantings of &quot.Streamco  to create diversity. 
Living Snow Fence   Streamco  willow is an excellent 
choice for creating living snow fence due to its stem 
density.  With Streamco, a single row snow fence 
will begin to trap snow in the second year, and 
become very effective in three to four years.

California bulrush is best established with plugs or 
potted plants derived from divisions of the rhizomes.  
Production of viable seed has proven unreliable for 
commercial purposes. 
 
Planting success is optimal in 12 inches of water but 
can be successful in one to 24 inches of water. 
Spacing depends on the size of the plant.  Trade 
gallons can be planted on spacing of five to ten feet, 
while smaller plants should be closer.  Planting in 
rows parallel to the shore is most effective.  In zones 
of high wave energy, plantings should be anchored in 
the hole by stakes or pins until the plant establishes 
itself.

UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_='Description and Adaptation 
Coastal little bluestem occurs almost exclusively 
along the coastal strip from southern New England to 
Texas.  It is a short (1-2 foot) bunch grass with coarse 
blue-green stems and basal leaves which often appear 
purplish. Coastal little bluestem is very similar to the 
inland little bluestem but can be distinguished by the 
bent stems at the base, whereas little bluestem stems 
are erect. Leaves are smooth but frequently are 
covered with hair at the base next to the sheath.  
Leaves tend to fold with maturity.  Seed head clusters 
are about three inches long and consist of a number 
of short, silvery hairs (awns) when the seeds are ripe. 
In the late summer to early fall a low sun slanting 
across the seed heads of this grass give the plant a 
frosty appearance.  As a warm season grass, it begins 
growth in late spring and continues through the hot 
summer period until the first killing frost. The entire 
plant has a reddish cast after frost. Ragged brownish-
tan stems often persist through the winter. 
 
For  a  current  distribution  map,  please  consult  the 
Plant  Profile  page  for  this  species  on  the  PLANTS 
Web site. 
 
Adaptation: Coastal little bluestem is very well 
adapted to dry, well to excessively drained, infertile 
secondary dunes. It does not tolerate large amounts of 
sand accretion. This grass has excellent drought 
tolerance once established, some salt spray tolerance 
and poor flood tolerance.  It grows preferentially on 
sites with pH 7.0 and slightly higher. 
 
' WHERE symbol='scli11';
ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD fs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_Establishment='Seeding methods for this species have not been 
developed for back dune stabilization. Chopping 
stems with mature seed attached into the sand may 
result in some natural recruitment. However, the most 
reliable method of establishment is planting plugs of 
this species on a 2-3 foot spacing between rows of 
American beachgrass (Ammophila breviligulata).

Most coastal municipalities have used aerial 
application of fertilizers applied in accordance with 
recommendations for American beachgrass 
(Ammophila breviligulata), since it is the key frontal 
dune species that intercepts the brunt of coastal storm 
energies.  It appears that the fertilization 
recommendations for American beachgrass serve the 
plant needs of multiple species within the same eco-
system application. 
 
Fertilize coastal little bluestem in nurseries, the 
ornamental horticultural industry and in home owner 
settings using the soil test recommendations of the 
local county extension service.  Apply fertilizer in 
accordance with soil test results.  If the soils lab does 
not maintain recommendations specifically for this 
species, they may use guidelines for similar species 
such as little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium) or 
other native warm season grass. 
 
Multiple passes with a flail-vac sweeper stripper has 
proven to be very effective in collecting seed from 
this species.

For critical area seeding, the preferred method of 
planting is drilling, but if this is not possible, an 
acceptable alternative method is broadcasting the 
seed (typically in a mix with other warm season 
grasses) and ‘tracking’ it in with a bulldozer.  The 
dozer moves up and down slope, off-setting each pass 
until the entire area is covered with tracks.  Seedings 
should be made as early as possible in the spring on 
sands and gravels, without mulching.  Moderate 
levels of N, P, and K are sufficient for establishment,

Control of competition is necessary for successful 
stand establishment.  High mowing (above the 
bluestem seedlings) is a common method of weed 
control.  Once established, poor stands can be 
rehabilitated by using proper management practices, 
such as controlled grazing, application of 
recommended rates of herbicides and fertilizer, and 
prescribed spring burning, where permitted.   
 
Do not graze a forage planting during the year of 
establishment.  During subsequent growing seasons, 
harvesting by controlled grazing or haying is possible 
on good stands.  Do not remove more than 50% of 
the current year’s growth from plants.  No cropping 
should occur below 8 inches or within 1 month of 
anticipated frosts.  Grazing of competing cool season 
grasses after frost in the fall and before the little 
bluestem is 1 inch tall in the spring is desirable.

Wild senna is a large, long-lived, herbaceous 
perennial, legume, .5 – 2 meters tall.  The stout, 
central stem is light green, and slightly hairy in the 
upper stem and at the base of the upper compound 
leaves.  The compound leaves are even-pinnate with 
about 10 – 20 leaflets.  The medium to dark green 
leaflets are individually up to 2 - 5 centimeters 
across.  Each leaflet is oblong, with smooth margins 
and a pointed tip.  Near the upper base of a 
compound leaf is a small club-shaped gland. this 
gland secrets nectar to attract certain kinds of insects.  
From the axils of the upper compound leaves upright 
racemes of yellow flowers form from July – August.  
Each unscented flower is about 15 millimeters across. 
has 5 pale yellow sepals and petals, 10 stamens with 
black anthers and a conspicuous pistil with long 
white hairs.  The dark brown seedpods are about 10 
centimeters long when fully mature in September – 
October.  The seed pods have 10 – 18 segments and 
split explosively.  There are about 50 seeds/gram.  
 
The root system of wild senna consists of a central 
taproot and rhizomes which often forms vegetative 
colonies.  It is not yet known if the plant has the 
ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen. 
 
Distribution: Wild senna is widely distributed in the 
eastern U.S. from Ontario, Canada south to Georgia.  
It is generally found on disturbed sites, moist 
meadows, pastures, fields or roadsides in full or 
partial sun.  It often flourishes within the floodplain 
of rivers.  While it prefers moist soils it will also 
grow on dry sites.

Wild senna, as with many other legumes, has a hard 
seed coat.  Scarify or chip the seed in order for water 
to be absorbed.  Soak the seed in warm water for 
three hours before sowing.  Cold stratification is not 
needed to induce germination.  Germination rates of

germinate the following spring.  
     
As with many other legumes, wild senna plants 
initially send their energy into their root system, 
therefore the top of the plant will be slow to develop. 
This initial slow top growth in the first two years is 
normal, especially in the early spring.  Once plants 
have become established they will grow vigorously 
and are very drought tolerant.   
 
Wild senna should be grown in soil that has good 
drainage in either a sunny or partly shaded location.  
This plant grows naturally in damp, fertile soils and 
under these conditions a height of 7 feet can be 
attained.  In a drier soil the plant will grow to about 3 
feet and tend to be less floppy.

Meadow checkerbloom is an uncommon, native, 
herbaceous perennial wildflower in the mallow family 
(Malvaceae).  A clump of stout, upright, hairy, hollow, 
branched stems originates from a thick taproot or short 
rhizome and grows 1½ to 6 ft tall.  The gray-green, 
alternate leaves have hairy stems 4 to 8 inches long and 
are 2 to 6 inches broad and deeply palmately divided into 
7 to 9 thin, hairy, toothed lobes with sharply pointed tips.  
The white to pale-pink, cup-shaped flowers have five 
petals that are about ¾ inch long.  The flowers are borne 
on short stalks, arranged in a simple or somewhat 
branched, elongated, open inflorescence, and mature from 
the bottom upward.  There are both bisexual and female 
plants. the female flowers are smaller and lack anthers 
(see photo below).

Flowering period is from June to August.  The fruit is a 
schizocarp which contains 7 to 9 single-seeded, beaked 
carpels about 1/8 inch long that form a ring, like the 
segments of an orange, and separate at maturity to fall 
from the parent plant. 
Meadow checkerbloom grows in meadows and prairies, 
as well as along roadsides and the edges of woodlands, 
wetlands and riparian areas.  Its native distribution 
extends throughout the Willamette Valley of Oregon at 
elevations below 700 ft.  It was introduced, probably as a 
garden plant, to the Seattle, Washington area, but it rarely 
persists there.  For updated distribution, please consult the

Weediness   
This plant may become weedy or invasive in some 
regions or habitats and may displace desirable vegetation 
if not properly managed.  Please consult your local NRCS 
Field Office, Cooperative Extension Service office, state 
natural resource, or state agriculture department regarding 
its status and use.  Weed information is also available 
from the PLANTS Web site at 
.  Please consult this and 
http://www.plants.usda.gov
Related Web Sites and view the plant profile for this 
species for further information.  
  
Description   
Awnless bushsunflower is a native, perennial warm-
season forb that grows 1½ to 3 feet tall.  The plant stands 
upright with multi-branches and a large woody or fleshy 
taproot.  The leaves of the awnless bushsunflower have an 
arrowhead appearance with jagged edges.  Older leaves at 
the bottom of the plant measure about two inches long 
while the newer leaves at the top are much shorter.  The 
stem splits into three separate stalks, each with its own 
flower.  Each flower is 1 to 1½ inches wide with yellow 
petals and a yellowish center.  
  
Adaptation  
Awnless bushsunflower is primarily adapted to the 
Edwards Plateau, but it also performs well in the western 
Gulf Coast Prairies, Rio Grande Plain, and Central 
Rolling Red and Grand Prairies.  It desires full sun, well-
drained soils like sandy or clay loams.  Awnless 
bushsunflower does not tolerate salinity, deep sands, 
heavy clays or wet bottomlands.  
  
Distribution: Please consult the Plant Profile page for this 
species on the PLANTS Web site.  
  
Establishment  
Awnless bushsunflower should be planted in the spring on 
a clean, firm seedbed.  Seed should be placed ¼ to ½ inch 
deep, but never covered more than ½ inch.  Fertilizer 
applications will vary depending on individual soil 
samples.  Nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus should be 
added to attain a medium fertility level.  A soil sample 
should always be taken before applying fertilizer.  
Awnless bushsunflower should be planted at a rate of 2.6 
lbs pure live seed (pls) per acre. When planting this as a 
component of a seed mixture, the seeding rate should be 
adjusted to the desired percent of the mix. 
 
Management  
Awnless bushsunflower is rarely planted as a monoculture 
planting but as a component of a range seeding mixture.  
At  a  minimum,  one  full  growing  season  of  grazing

Alan Shadow, NRCS, East Texas PMC, Nacogdoches, TX  
 
Alternate Names 
Rosinweed, gum weed, cut-leaf silphium, or turpentine 
plant 
 
Uses 
Livestock: It is reported that compass plant is palatable 
and nutritious and grazed by livestock especially in its 
juvenile state. It will decrease in heavily grazed pastures 
and eventually be removed from the site in continuously 
grazed situations.  
Native Americans: The powdered root of compass plant 
was used by the Pawnees to make a tea for individuals 
with general debility. The Indian children of several tribes 
used the resinous sap as a chewing gum to cleanse their 
teeth and sweeten their breath.  
Wildlife: Small mammals and birds eat the seed of 
compass plant. In grasslands the compass plant provides a 
sturdy perch for prairie song birds. The eastern kingbirds 
use the compass plant as a perch to locate and capture 
grassland insects. 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g. threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
Description and Adaptation 
General: Compass plant is a long lived, perennial member 
of the sunflower family. Its basal leaves and stems all 
arise from an underground crown. A large reddish brown 
tap root 1 to 2 inches in diameter is located just below the 
crown. The tap root rapidly looses diameter as it descends 
up to 16 feet into the prairie soil. The large basal leaves 
can be 15 to 24 inches long and are deeply cut like a giant 
pin oak leaf. The rigid, sand paper like leaves orient 
themselves in a north to south direction to avoid the direct 
rays of the midday sun, thus leading to the plants common 
name, compass plant. Stems are erect and number from 
one to several with an overall height of from 3 to 10 feet. 
The simple leaves are alternately arranged on the stem 
and are less divided, smaller and have direct attachment 
higher up on the stem. Leaves are leathery and stiff with 
rough surfaces and hairs occurring on the leaf main veins. 
Large yellow flower heads from 2 to 4 inches across are 
conspicuous on the upper half to two thirds of the stem in 
small clusters. Flowering begins in late June and proceeds 
through August. Flower heads begin opening at the top of 
the stem first. There are 15 to 34 narrow yellow petal 
flowers (ray florets) that are 1 to 2 inches long. The center 
of the flower contains the numerous disk florets with 
yellow corollas.  The fruit is a flattened achene about ½ 
inch long with a notched tip. Achenes develop on the 
outside of the head since the ray florets are the only fertile 
seed producing units on the flower. 
 
Distribution: Please consult the Plant Profile page for this 
species on the PLANTS Web site. Compass plant grows 
in the eastern half of Kansas. It is found in the eastern 
section of the Great Plains from North Dakota to Texas 
and east to Ohio and Alabama.   
 
Establishment 
The easiest way to propagate compass plant is by planting 
stratified seed in the spring or unstratified seed in the fall. 
Moist stratification (60 days at 40 degrees F) and 
scarification will promote germination of this species. To 
scarify the seed, nick the seed coat with a sharp knife 
prior to planting. The initial year the seedling will exist as 
a single leaf, and it will normally take two to three years 
for the plant to mature and reproduce sexually. Much of 
the plants energy and carbon are invested in extensive 
root production the first few years. 
   
Management 
Seed heads can be harvested from production fields in late 
August or September. The seed heads can be run through 
a hammer mill to break out the seed units and release the 
achenes. Then the achenes can be run through a two 
screen cleaner to increase purity of the product. The seed

can be cleaned to a purity of 48 percent with 
approximately 18,400 seeds per pound. Seed lots cleaned 
at the Manhattan PMC have had purities as great as 96 % 
and a germination of 88 %. 
 
Compass plant seedlings have only a single leaf their first 
year of growth. Speculation has it that compass plant will 
not produce flowers until the second or third year of 
growth. Other plant enthusiasts indicate that perhaps 
compass plant needs four or five years to produce flowers 
and seed. Should compass plant be grown as a specimen 
plant it may need to be staked up to prevent its stems from 
being blown over by the wind. 
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
A disease was noted and studied on compass plant grown 
in Poland as a horticultural crop. The disease symptoms 
were noticed on approximately 15 percent of the 
population of plants. The plants exhibited stunting, 
yellowing and reduced inflorescence production. Oblong 
brown-purplish lesions were noticed on the plants stems 
in July. The causal agent isolated from the lesions was 
Alternaria alternata which was subsequently grown on 
artificial media and used to re-infect compass plant 
seedlings.  
Compass plant, grown in a cultivated situation, has also 
been known to have stems blown down when subjected to 
strong winds at full maturity.  
 
Environmental Concerns 
Compass plant does not spread vegetatively except as the 
clump of the original plant grows in diameter. This plant 
volunteers easily from seed, but does not spread actively.  
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
Two compass plant germplasm lines, NF-1 and NF-1 
Profuse Ligule, were developed by the Samuel Roberts 
Noble Foundation Inc. in Ardmore, OK. These 
germplasm lines should be useful in developing improved 
cultivars, novel germplasm, as well as studying the 
biology, ecology, and genetics of the compass plant. Seed 
stocks of the two lines will be maintained by the 
Biotechnology Group at the Noble Foundation.

GOLDENROD 
Solidago canadensis L. 
Plant Symbol = SOCA6 
 
Contributed by:  NRCS Plant Materials Center, Pullman, 
WA 
Forage:  This plant is grazed by cattle, sheep, horses, and 
whitetail deer.   
 
Ethnobotanical:  The Iroquois, Okanagan-Colville, 
Potowatomi, Shuswap, Zuni, Gosiute and Navajo utilized 
Canada goldenrod for various medical purposes.  
 
Ornamental: Canada goldenrod is not typically planted in 
a landscaped setting due to its spreading rhizomatous 
growth.  However, it is possible to manage plants by 
planting in a pot submersed in the ground, or by removing 
new growth each year.  Seed dispersal can be controlled 
by removing flower heads prior to seed ripening. 
 
Status 
Consult the PLANTS Web site and your State Department 
of Natural Resources for this plant’s current status (e.g., 
threatened or endangered species, state noxious status, 
and wetland indicator values). 
 
Weediness 
Goldenrods have a reputation of being weedy due to their 
aggressive rhizomatous growth.  However, in stable 
rangeland environments they seldom achieve densities 
that are problematic.  Please consult with your local 
NRCS Field Office, Cooperative Extension Service 
office, state natural resource, or state agriculture 
department regarding this plant’s status and management.   
Description and Adaptation 
General:  Sunflower family (Asteraceae).  Solidago 
canadensis is a native, warm-season, long-lived perennial 
that spreads by rhizomes and forms large, dense patches.  
Stems are mostly smooth, covered with fine hairs at the 
top and are 1 to 7 ft tall.  Leaves are sharply toothed, 
lance-shaped, covered with fine hairs, triple-nerved and 2 
to 5 inches long.  Flower panicles occur at the end of each 
stem, and when open, are 10 inches wide.  Inflorescences 
occur mostly on one side of long, drooping panicle 
branches, have 10 to 17 ray flowers, and bloom July 
through October.  Pollination typically occurs by the aid 
of insects. Seeds are small and dry with sparse hairs and 
numerous pale bristles at the tip. 
 
Solidago canadensis can be distinguished from S. 
missouriensis by its taller stature and its larger, more 
branched, open flower panicles.  S. canadensis can be 
distinguished from S. giganteus by its hairs on the stems 
and yellow bracts.  
 
Canada goldenrod is adapted to areas receiving full sun or 
part shade and 16 to 60 in of annual precipitation.  Plants 
typically grow in moist soil with medium texture and 
moderate levels of organic matter.  They are found in 
 
 
Solidago canadensis. www.discoverlife.org 
 
Alternate Names 
Canadian goldenrod, meadow goldenrod, common 
goldenrod, giant goldenrod, tall goldenrod, shorthair 
goldenrod (S. canadensis var. gilvocanescens), Hager’s 
goldenrod (S. canadensis var. hargeri), rough goldenrod 
(S. canadensis var. salebrosa). 
 
Uses 
Pollinator habitat: Solidago species provide vital sources 
of pollen and nectar for bees and other insects in the late 
summer and fall throughout North America. 
 
Rangeland revegetation: Canada goldenrod can be used 
for revegetation of disturbed areas, for mine spoil 
reclamation, and soil stabilization.

damp meadows, waterways, and ditches along roadsides 
and railroads.  They may also inhabit dry, open slopes in 
upland prairies, and deciduous and evergreen forests.  
Plants are not found on waterlogged sites and only rarely 
found on very dry sites. 
Canada goldenrod grows in all US states except HI, LA, 
AL, GA, SC and FL, and all Canadian provinces except 
Nunavut.  The plant has five varieties (ecotypes):  var. 
canadensis (Canada goldenrod), var. gilvocanescens 
(shorthair goldenrod), var. hargeri (Harger’s goldenrod), 
var. lepida (Canada goldenrod), and var. salebrosa (rough 
goldenrod).  For current distribution of this species and 
varieties, consult the Plant Profile page on the PLANTS 
Web site. 
 
Management 
This plant spreads by rhizomes and by seed.  Where plant 
spread is not desired, seedlings should be planted in a 
large pot or barrel submersed in the soil, or new growth 
should be cut and removed each year.  To prevent seed 
dispersal, flower heads should be removed prior to seed 
ripening.  Plants will withstand vigorous cutting, and will 
regrow if cut during the growing season.  
Pests and Potential Problems 
Solidago canadensis is susceptible to many pathogens and 
insect pests, which may reduce seed production.   
Environmental Concerns 
This plant may form dense stands in some habitats, 
particularly where ground is open and disturbed.  To 
prevent dense stands from forming, seed Canada 
goldenrod at low densities or plant in small areas. 
Control 
If control of this species is desired, contact your local 
agricultural extension specialist or county weed specialist 
to learn what works best in your area and how to use it 
safely.  Always read label and safety instructions for any 
control method.   
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
None.  Seed and seedlings, however, are available from 
multiple vendors. 
Canada goldenrod distribution from the USDA PLANTS Database 
Establishment 
Plants can be established by seed, seedlings, or rhizomes.  
Seed should be planted into a firm, weed-free seed bed at 
a rate of 0.5 lb PLS/ac and at a depth of 0.125 to 0.25 
inches.  If planted in a mix, the seeding rate should be 
adjusted according to the proportion of the mix.  Seed is 
non-dormant, and can be planted in the fall or spring.   
 
Plants established by seedlings can be started by sowing 
seed in containers placed in a greenhouse in January.  
Seed should be covered lightly with soil and kept moist 
until germination.  A layer of pea gravel can be applied to 
the soil surface to prevent seeds from floating.  Plants 
should be moved to a cold-frame in late March or early 
April and hardened off for 2 to 4 weeks prior to 
transplanting into a prepared field site in early May.  
Plants should be spaced 1 to 2 ft apart. 
 
Plants can also be established by rhizomes.  Sections of 
rhizomes should be collected from cultivated plants or 
approved areas, kept moist during transport, and replanted 
in a prepared field site.

Description and Adaptation 
General:  Sunflower family (Asteraceae).  Solidago 
missouriensis is a native, warm-season, short-lived 
perennial.  Stems grow singularly or in group from a 
woody base or creeping rhizome.  Stems are reddish-
green, smooth, slender, erect and are 8 to 36 inches tall. 
Leaves are alternate, triple-nerved and have entire or 
sparsely serrated edges.  Basal leaves are up to 12 inches 
long and 1 inch wide, and have short petioles. Upper 
leaves are smaller and sessile.  Numerous inflorescences 
form on curved panicle branches.  Inflorescences have 7 
to 13 yellow disc flowers and 8 to 13 yellow ray flowers, 
and bloom July through October.  Seeds are brown, 
cylindrical, smooth or hairy, and have white bristly 
pappus.  
 
Missouri goldenrod is adapted to areas receiving 12 to 35 
inches of annual precipitation at elevations up to 10,600 
feet.  Plants grow well in sandy loam to clay loam soils, 
and poorly in gravel or dense clay.  Plants are tolerant of 
weakly acidic to moderately basic and weakly saline soil.   


Page 2
 
Plants grow on dry, open slopes in upland prairies, plains, 
meadows, deciduous and evergreen forests, deserts, and 
along roadsides, railroads, ditches and fences.   
Missouri goldenrod is found in most Midwestern and 
western states in the U.S., and in the south-central and 
southwest provinces of Canada.  There are four varieties:  
var. fasciculata, var. missouriensis, var. tenuissima, and 
var. tolmieana (Tolmie’s goldenrod). For current 
distribution of this species and varieties, consult the Plant 
Profile page on the PLANTS Web site. 
 
Management 
This plant spreads by rhizomes and by seed.  Where plant 
spread is not desired, seedlings should be planted in a 
large pot or barrel submersed in the soil, or new growth 
should be cut and removed each year.  To prevent seed 
dispersal, flower heads should be removed prior to seed 
ripening.  Plants will withstand vigorous cutting, and will 
regrow if cut during the growing season.  
Pests and Potential Problems 
Missouri goldenrod can be damaged by a native leaf 
feeding beetle, Trirhabda canadensis (Skinner 2004). 
Environmental Concerns 
This plant may form dense stands in some habitats, 
particularly where ground is open and disturbed.  To 
prevent dense stands from forming, seed Missouri 
goldenrod at low densities or plant in small areas.

UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_DescriptionandAdaptation='Gray goldenrod is a native perennial  wildflower  it is 
one of the smaller species of goldenrod, growing 
from 6 inches and seldom reaching 2.5 feet tall.  The 
central stem is reddish or grey-green and covered 
with short white hairs, often in lines.  Usually this 
stem has winged leaflets at the axils of the upper 
leaves.  The alternate leaves are up to 4 inches long 
and ¾” across, pubescent (covered with fine short 
hairs) and become smaller as they ascend the stem.  
The leaves taper to a narrow base and have a soft 
scratch feel to them.  The leaf margins are smooth or 
slightly serrate.  Grey goldenrod flowers later than 
most other goldenrods.  The narrow flower is wider 
in the middle and has numerous yellow compound 
flowers that are about ¼” across.    The blooming 
period occurs during the fall and lasts about a month.  
The flowers occasionally have a slight fragrance.  
After flowering, the  small dry seed  develops with 
tufts of hair and are dispersed by the wind.  The root 
system consists of a branching caudex (a thickened 
root structure that serves as water storage for the 
plant) and rhizomes.  The caudex root system is 
especially prevalent on older plants.  In suitable 
locations, grey goldenrod has a tendency to form 
groups of plants.   
 
Grey goldenrod is a carefree plant that prefers 
growing in full sun and dry soil. This plant thrives in 
sand, clay or gravel soils.  It will also grow in fertile 
soils however it can be short-lived if the site is too 
rich. 
Distribution:  This species is widely distributed from 
Georgia to Texas, north to Nova Scotia and Alberta

United States.  Indiangrass grows 3 to 5 feet tall.  
Even as a young plant, it can be distinguished from 
other native grass species by the “rifle-sight” ligule at 
the point where the leaf attaches to the stem.  The 
leaf blade also narrows at the point of attachment.  
The seed head is a single, narrow, plume-like panicle

seedings, the rate should be between 12 and 15 
pounds per acre. Seeding depth is ¼ inch.  If seed is 
broadcast or hydroseeded, it is important to 
“incorporate” the seed by tracking with a heavy 
machine to improve the seed to soil contact.  
Indiangrass has strong seedling vigor, but stands are 
slow to develop where competition from broadleaf 
weeds and cool-season grasses are heavy.  New 
seedings into fine-textured soils where weeds are 
persistent may require no-till establishment to 
minimize the amount of exposed weed seeds.  The 
cool-season grasses must be controlled with a contact 
herbicide before seeding.  Also, indiangrass shows 
tolerance to most broadleaf herbicides.  It is 
important to follow label instructions for application 
amounts and grazing requirements. 
The most common cause of failure of warm-season 
grasses is a loose seedbed.  Conventionally-tilled 
seedbeds should be packed before and especially 
after seeding.  The seedbed should be firm enough to 
show only a light imprint when stepped on.  When 
using a no-till drill, be sure the coulter furrows are 
closed to avoid seed exposure and drying.  This can 
be accomplished by cultipacking after the drilling' WHERE symbol='sonu2';

Fertilization to moderate levels of phosphorus and 
potassium are recommended for establishment.  
Nitrogen applications are not recommended until the 
grass is established and well above the competing 
weeds.  Fertilizer may be applied late in the first 
summer of establishment at a rate of 20 to 40 pounds 
per acre of phosphorus and potassium or in the early 
summer of the second year at 40 to 80 pounds per 
acre rate.  In future years fertilize as needed to 
enhance vigor and production of forage.  For critical 
area seedings, no additional fertilization is necessary. 
If well-established stands of indiangrass are properly 
managed and maintained, they should not require 
replanting.  Poor stands can be rejuvenated by using 
proper management practices, such as controlled 
grazing, the application of recommended rates of 
herbicides and fertilizer, and prescribed burning, 
where permitted, before the beginning of spring 
growth.  Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium 
fertilizer should be applied according to soil tests. 
In rotational grazing systems, remove no more than 
½ the above ground growth (no shorter than 8 to 12 
inches).  With care, the stand will last indefinitely.  
Forage quality will remain high until the seed head 
emerges.  Grazing should begin from mid to late June 
when grasses reach 12 to 16 inches in height.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overgrazing can damage the stand and should be 
stopped when the plants are grazed to within 6 inches 
of the ground.  If regrowth of more than 12 inches 
takes place, the plants can be regrazed to 6 to 12 
inches.  Leaving this much stubble before frost 
allows the plants to store carbohydrates and ensures 
the production of vigorous plant growth in the spring.

golden yellow flowers it produces from August through 
October. 
Seaside goldenrod is native and well adapted to coastal 
habitats including the backside of primary dunes, low 
secondary dunes and edges of salt marshes.  It has some 
tolerance for drought allowing it to survive in the dry 
conditions of the dunes. Seaside goldenrod often occurs 
with other native dune plants such as switchgrass, salt 
meadow cordgrass and American beachgrass.  The 
range of seaside goldenrod extends from Quebec south 
to Florida and Texas.

Uses 
Dune Restoration:  Seaside goldenrod is a beneficial 
native perennial that may be used to add biodiversity to 
dune restoration projects.  
Wildlife Habitat:  Seaside goldenrod provides benefits 
for native wildlife such as butterflies, birds, and small 
mammals. It is a major food source for the fall 
migrating monarch butterfly. 
Ornamental:  With showy bright yellow flowers 
blooming late August to early October, seaside 
goldenrod is an excellent addition to pollinator gardens, 
butterfly gardens and ornamental flower beds. 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s 
current status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, 
state noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
Description and Adaptation 
Seaside goldenrod is a perennial forb that is a member 
of the Aster family.  The plant may grow up to six feet 
tall at maturity.   The plants alternately arranged leaves 
are fleshy, dark green, oblong, lance shaped and are 
produced the entire length of the stem.  The leaves at 
the base of the plant are the largest, up to 20 inches, and 
become smaller up the stem of the plant.  Seaside 
goldenrod derives its name from the numerous bright 
Seaside goldenrod distribution from USDA-NRCS PLANTS 
Database. 
 
For updated distribution, please consult the Plant

Conservation: Alkali sacaton is frequently utilized for 
seeding and stabilizing disturbed areas. Due to its salt 
tolerance, it is recommended for seeding saline sites such 
as oil well pits and saline waste from power generating 
plants.  
  
Landscaping: A mass planting of this species could create 
a contrast to coarser foliaged plants.

noxious status, and wetland indicator values).  
  
 
Plant Fact Sheet
Description and Adaptation  
Alkali sacaton is a native perennial large bunchgrass 
ranging in height from 50 to 150 cm (20-60 inches). The 
leaves are flat, 2-6 mm (1/16-1/4 inches) wide, and taper 
from the base of the leaf. The inflorescence is an open 
panicle 20-50 cm (8-20 inches) long with a pyramidal 
shape. The small seeds rest singly on branches in the 
loose, open seedhead.  Bloom periods vary by region: 
April to May in the Southwest, June-October in the Great 
Plains, and July-August in the Northwest.  
  
Alkali sacaton is found in the western half of the United 
States. It grows in both saline and nonsaline coarse, 
medium, and fine textured soils. This grass is tolerant of 
salinity and a broad range of pH. After establishment, 
alkali sacaton is tolerant of drought and water inundation. 
However, it is intolerant of shade and is found growing in 
open areas.  
  
Establishment  
Alkali sacaton reproduces from seeds and tillers. The 
seeds remain viable for years and germinate without being 
scarified. In Utah, a seed study reported 99% seed 
germination of seeds that were stored in an open 
warehouse for 7 years. Plant seeds in the spring when soil 
temperature will be near 86
probabilities are greatest. The plants can survive on 12 to 
18 inches of precipitation per year.   
  
Management  
Alkali sacaton is an important forage species in the arid 
and semiarid regions of the Southwest United States. The 
grass is tolerant of moderate grazing and a good forage 
producer. It has the ability to efficiently use extra water 
during forage production. Alkali sacaton is tolerant of 
fire. however, it can be killed if the fire is severe. Fire 
recovery has been reported from 2 to 4 years. Summer 
fires have more of an effect than winter fires.   
  
Pests and Potential Problems  
Alkali sacaton is considered a primary or secondary 
invader on saline soils. The plant intrudes directly on 
saline flats or follows a stage where “succulent” plants are 
dominant.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD fs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_Establishment='Due to sparse and irregular seed production, smooth 
cordgrass is usually propagated by vegetative stem 
divisions.  Depending on the energy effecting the 
planting site, either containerized (for high impact 
sites) or bare root (for mild impact sites) plants can 
be utilized.  Since most marsh sites are irregular and 
difficult to access, hand planting is normally 
employed, using spades, dibbles, or planting bars.  If 
site conditions are adequate, planting can be carried 
out with a mechanical, tractor drawn transplanter.  
Plant spacing should be between 18 and 72 inches. 2 
to 10 feet of lateral spread can be expected annually.  
Smooth cordgrass grows at elevations ranging from 
mean high tide and above.  Planting at an excessively 
low elevation will result in failure due to drowning 
and/or uprooting where wave energy is too high. 
Plantings in deeper water have been successful, but 
plants are slow to anchor and vegetative cover is 
sparse.  Optimum water depths for establishing plants 
are 1 to 18 inches. 
 
Shoreline plantings are typically planted as a single 
or double row running parallel to the shoreline.  
Transplants should be planted at the mid-point 
between the high and low tide elevation.  Plant 
spacing within the row will vary according to the size 
of the transplant materials being used and the rate at 
which full coverage is desired. 
 
Open water area plantings across mudflats and 
dredge fill sites should be designed to provide the 
greatest reduction in fetch length.  Rows can be 
placed across shallow water exchange points to create 
a passive hydrologic barrier that will slow tidal 
exchange and trap suspended sediments.   
 
In nursery rows, plants of smooth cordgrass should 
be spaced 12 to 24 inches apart.  Under ideal nursery 
conditions, each planting unit will establish stands 
containing 25 culms per square foot.  Extensive weed 
control is essential to producing quality nursery 
grown plants.

Uses  
Erosion Control:  Spike dropseed may be used as a 
component of a seeding mixture for critical area plantings 
and conservation cover.  It is a bunchgrass with very thick 
vegetation near the soil surface which can be used to 
stabilize sandy eroding soils.  
  
Wildlife:  Spike dropseed is utilized as a food source by 
various wildlife species.  Particularly, upland birds feed 
on the mature seed that is produced.  It also provides good 
cover for birds and small mammals.  
  
Livestock:  Many species of livestock will graze on spike 
dropseed.  It has a nutritional value of fair. The species 
has the ability to recover and reseed itself if heavy grazing 
occurs.  
  
Status

(http://plants.usda.gov) and your State Department of 
Natural Resources for this plant’s current status (e.g. 
threatened or endangered species, state noxious status, 
and wetland indicator values).

its status and use.  Weed information is also available 
from the PLANTS Web site at 
.  Please consult this and 
http://www.plants.usda.gov
Related Web Sites and view the plant profile for this 
species for further information.  
  
Description   
Spike dropseed is a native, perennial, warm season 
bunchgrass with erect stems that grow 3 feet tall.  It 
begins growing in the spring when moisture levels 
increase and matures to produce seed in October.  The 
leaf blades grow to about 1.5 feet long and ½ inch wide.  
The leaves are flat when the plant is actively growing, but 
as the plant begins to dry, they become V-shaped.  The 
sheaths of the leaves are hairy along the margins.  The 
seedhead is ½ inch wide and six inches to approximately 
1.5 feet long.    
  
Adaptation  
Spike dropseed is adapted to a large portion of the 
southwest United States.  It is found from Texas to 
California, and as far north as Nevada and Colorado.  
Spike dropseed is adapted to a wide range of soil types, 
but performs best on loamy fine, silty and sandy loam 
soils.  
  
Distribution: Please consult the Plant Profile page for this 
species on the PLANTS Web site.  
  
Establishment  
Spike dropseed should be planted on a clean, firm 
seedbed.  Planting can be done using either a grass drill or 
broadcast seeding, but grass drills are the most successful 
method of planting.  Seed should be placed less than 1/8 
inch deep on fine textured and  ½ inch on sandy soils.  
Spike dropseed should be planted at a rate of 1.0 lb pure 
live seed (pls) per acre. When planting spike dropseed as 
a component of a seed mixture, the seeding rate should be 
adjusted to the desired percent of the mix. Soil samples 
should be taken before planting to determine the amount 
of fertilizer needed to bring the fertility level up to a 
medium range.  Nitrogen should be limited to less than 
ten pounds per acre until a stand is evident.    
  
Management  
Spike dropseed is commonly found as a component in 
seed mixtures for range and pastures.  Stands of spike 
dropseed should be well established before livestock 
grazing is permitted.  Once the stand is established, spike 
dropseed should never be grazed or cut below five to six 
inches.  Grazing can begin the first winter after planting 
on well established areas.  Spike dropseed can reseed

ROSE SPIREA 
Spiraea douglasii Hook 
Plant Symbol = SPDO 
Contributed by: USDA NRCS Plant Materials Center, 
Corvallis, Oregon 
 
Photo by Dale Darris  
 
Alternate names  
There are two botanical varieties, var. douglasii and var. 
menziesii, with the latter referred to as Menzies’ spirea. 
Other common names include Douglas spirea, Western 
spirea, hardhack, steeplebush, meadowsweet, and pink 
spirea.  
  
Uses  
Rose spirea is useful for stabilization of stream-banks and 
shorelines as well as the restoration of wetlands including 
marshes, bogs, and open swamps. Limbs are suitable for 
branch packing, fascines, and other soil bioengineering 
practices.  In some cases this species should be planted 
sparingly at best because of its ability to spread and 
dominate favorable sites. Rose spirea withstands 
competition from wetland grasses better than certain other 
woody species.  If not severely shaded when young, it 
may also compete well with exotic reed canarygrass.  
  
Rose spirea provides good cover for birds and small 
mammals. Grouse apparently eat the dried spikes and 
other wildlife consume the seed filled capsules.  The 
flowers are a source of nectar for hummingbirds, 
butterflies, and other pollinator insects.  Although 
occasionally browsed by deer and livestock, it is 
considered poor forage and little mention is made 
concerning its nutritional value and palatability. Native 
Americans made minor use of this plant. At least one tribe 
used the seeds to make a tea for the treatment of diarrhea. 
The branches were used to spread and cook salmon, hang 
salmon for drying and smoking, and make brooms.  With 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
its attractive and fragrant flower clusters, rose spirea is 
used for naturalistic landscaping, ponds, hedges, and 
screens. The canes and dry flower heads provide visual 
interest in winter.  
  
Description  
Rose spirea is a deciduous shrub in the Rose family that 
grows 2 to 7 ft tall, has upright slender limbs, and spreads 
by suckers (under-ground shoots) to form dense thickets. 
The leaves are oblong to elliptical in shape, 1 to 3 in. 
long, lighter and sometimes wooly beneath, and toothed 
along the upper half of the margins. Tiny, fragrant reddish 
pink flowers are borne in dense, elongate clusters at the 
end of shoots. The clusters appear ‘fuzzy’ from the 
abundance of long stamens. Flowering occurs from June 
to September. The fruit is a smooth, dry follicle that 
persists in winter. This species hybridizes in the wild with 
white spirea (Spiraea betulifolia).  
  
Status  
Please consult the Plants Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status, such as state noxious and wetland indicator values.  
  
Adaptation  
Rose spirea grows best in full sun to dappled shade and in 
a wide range of soils (gravelly sandy loams to heavy 
clays) that range from acidic to neutral (pH 4.5-7.5) and 
from moist well drained to wet and poorly drained 
(hydric). The species tolerates extended periods of 
flooding and perpetually water-logged soils. Only the 
most severe fires will eliminate regrowth from basal 
portions and suckers.  
  
Distribution- Rose spirea occurs naturally from southern 
Alaska south to northern California and east to western 
Montana. The elevation range is sea-level to 6,500 ft in 
the mountains.  Habitat includes damp meadows, riparian 
zones, bogs, marshes, open swamps, and the margins of 
ponds and lakes. It is a member of many willow, alder, 
freshwater marsh, moist coniferous forest, scrub shrub 
and semi-aquatic plant communities. 
 
Limitations or environmental concerns  
Rose spirea may be susceptible to fire blight disease 
which causes dieback of tips and scorched looking leaves.  
It is host to several insect pests including aphids, leaf 
rollers, and scales. This species can become invasive, as it 
spreads readily by suckers and seedlings, especially on 
flat, moist to wet sites in full sun.  Dense thickets can 
become nearly impenetrable and too competitive for other 
desirable plant species.  It may not be suitable for small 
areas without regular management.  The species is a mild

describe it as poisonous, possibly because spireas in 
general are known to contain aspirin like compounds 
which in concentrated form are toxic if taken internally.

Establishment  
Rose spirea is readily propagated by softwood, semi-
hardwood, and dormant hardwood cuttings, layering, 
rhizome and root segments (in spring), division, and seed. 
With spring cuttings, some suggest making a slice cut at 
the basal end, soaking in water for several weeks in a 
cooler, and dipping in a rooting hormone (1000 ppm IBA-
talc or solution) before planting into a light rooting 
medium. Mist benches and bottom heat may also improve 
rooting. If installed properly in fall or winter, a fair 
percentage of untreated hardwood cuttings (18 in or 
longer) can root and establish directly on suitable, moist 
revegetation sites.  As with rooted stock, mulch, first year 
irrigation, and weed suppression are beneficial for 
establishment in the nursery and field.     
Seed is collected in fall when the fruits turn dry and 
brown and then extracted from the capsules by shaking or 
tumbling.  Store the seed under cool dry 
conditions.Germination occurs quickly without seed 
treatment if little drying has occurred prior to sowing.  
Otherwise, the seed may require 1 to 3 months of 
prechilling (moist cold stratification at 33 to 38°F) or fall 
sowing to break dormancy over winter.   
  
Improved cultivars and selected materials (and area of 
origin)  
For streambank stabilization and rehabilitation of 
wetlands at low elevation in western Oregon and 
Washington, the NRCS Plant Materials Center, Corvallis, 
OR, and the Agricultural Experiment Stations of Oregon 
and Washington released ‘Bashaw’ Douglas spirea.  
Clonally propagated, it originated from a stand in 
Snohomish Co., WA.

upper part is usually flat, slightly twisted with 
saw-toothed bristles on the edge.  The leaf sheath is 
keeled, the basal ones hairy at the throat, and the base 
hard and shining.  The ligule is hairy.  The seedhead 
is an open panicle 12 to 20 inches long and only 1 or 
2 seed stalks are produced from single bunch.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD fs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_Establishment='Due to sparse seed production, saltmeadow cordgrass 
is usually propagated by vegetative stem divisions.  
Depending on the energy effecting the planting site, 
either containerized (high impact sites) or bare root 
(mild impact sites) plants can be utilized.  Bare root 
material should contain 3 to 5 stems per planting unit, 
while containers should have at least 5 to 8 healthy 
stems.  Bare root plugs are generally limited to 
planting sites that are exposed to little or no wave 
energy.  Since most marsh sites are irregular and 
difficult to access, hand planting is normally 
employed, using spades, dibbles, or planting bars.  If 
site conditions are right, planting can be carried out 
with a mechanical, tractor drawn transplanter.  Plant 
spacing should be between 18 and 36 inches. up to 2 
feet of lateral spread can be expected annually. 
In nursery rows, plants of saltmeadow cordgrass 
should be spaced 6 to 12 inches apart.  Under ideal 
nursery conditions, each planting unit should be able 
to yield up to 50 stems in a single growing season.

to new sites successfully.   
 
Restoration of coastal sites by seeding may also be 
successful.  Currently the Kika de la Garza PMC is 
evaluating the seed potential of gulf cordgrass.  Two 
accessions have had over 30% seed germination over 
two successive years.  Seed yeild has averaged 330 
pounds per acre, with approximately 454,000 seeds 
per pound. 
In 1997-98, Kika de la Garza Plant Materials Center 
staff used gulf cordgrass transplants in a coastal 
shoreline stabilization project that they worked on in 
partnership with the San Patricio (Texas) Soil and 
Water Conservation District.  Gulf cordgrass had a 
97% survival rate, and was found to be best adapted

Uses  
Revegetation:  Texas dropseed has the ability to tolerate 
higher levels of salinity and alkalinity in the soil.  It can 
be used to revegetate areas such as oil well pads and on 
other saline soils.   
  
Erosion Control:  Texas dropseed is a bunchgrass with 
very thick vegetation near the soil surface which can be 
used to stabilize soils that have a tendency to erode.  
  
Wildlife:  Texas dropseed provides dense cover for birds 
and small mammals.  The foliage is browsed by deer and 
small mammals.  The seed can be eaten by birds and 
small mammals.  
  
Status  
Please consult the PLANTS Web site 
(http://plants.usda.gov) and your State Department of 
Natural Resources for this plant’s current status (e.g. 
threatened or endangered species, state noxious status, 
and wetland indicator values).  
  
Weediness   
This plant may become weedy or invasive in some 
regions or habitats and may displace desirable vegetation 
if not properly managed.  Please consult your local NRCS 
Field Office, Cooperative Extension Service office, state 
natural resource, or state agriculture department regarding 
its status and use.  Weed information is also available 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
from the PLANTS Web site at 
http://www.plants.usda.gov.  Please consult this and 
Related Web Sites and view the plant profile for this 
species for further information.  
  
Description   
Texas dropseed is a warm-season perennial bunchgrass 
that grows close to the soil surface.  The culms of the 
plant range from twelve to twenty inches long.  The leaf 
blades range from 1 ½ to 5 inches long and less than 1 ½ 
inches wide.  They are smooth on the bottom side, but 
scabrous on the top.  The seed head is a panicle-type with 
many spreading branches and branchlets.  The seed head 
is between four to twelve inches long and almost the same 
wide.  Once the seed matures, from June to August, the 
seed head breaks away from the plant.  
  
Adaptation  
Texas dropseed is found from Texas north to Nebraska, 
and west from Utah to Arizona.  The plant is adapted to 
soils with higher saline and alkaline levels.  
  
Distribution: Please consult the Plant Profile page for this 
species on the PLANTS Web site.  
  
Establishment  
Texas dropseed should be planted on a clean, firm 
seedbed.  Planting can be done using either a grass drill or 
broadcast seeding.  Seed is planted less than ½ inch deep 
at a rate of 1.0 lbs pure live seed (pls) per acre.  When 
planting this as a component of a seed mixture, the 
seeding rate should be adjusted to the desired percent of 
the mix. Soil samples should be taken before planting to 
determine the amount of fertilizer needed to bring the 
fertility level up to a medium range.    
  
Management  
Texas dropseed is used as a component in seed mixtures 
for ranges and pastures.  Stands of Texas dropseed should 
be well established before livestock is permitted to graze.  
Proper management is required to ensure the plant is not 
overgrazed or over utilized by livestock or wildlife.  
Consult your local NRCS Field Office for assistance with 
planning and applying prescribed grazing

UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_='Management 
Sporobolus virginicus is a low maintenance 
conservation plant.  Because it is very drought 
tolerant, water requirements are relatively low.  It is 
recommended, though, that irrigation be applied 
during the first 1-2 months after transplanting to help 
establish plots.  S. virginicus is also adapted to low 
fertility soils, although nutrient amendments 
according to soil tests would be beneficial for rapid 
establishment.   
 
If forage production is desired, no more than half of 
the growth should be removed by grazing.  Summer 
grazing deferments of at least 120 days are important 
to maintain good vigor.  Controlled burning of this 
grass will result in lush, tender forage for winter 
grazing.  Burning should be done no more than every 
2 years. Allow 4 inches of re-growth after burning 
before grazing.

to plant too shallow than too deep.  A seeding rate of 
1/2 to 1 pound of pure live seed per acre is 
recommended.  Plants can also be grown in small 
paper containers and then transplanted for 
establishment of grass hedges and wind barriers.  On 
saline soils, weed-free mulch can be used to improve 
establishment.  Establishment is highly dependent on 
good rainfall or irrigation. 
Soil analysis should be performed prior to planting to 
determine salinity levels and necessary levels of 
nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium.  Nitrogen 
should not be applied until the stand is established.  
Evaluate the stand after 60 days.  If 1 plant per square 
foot is present than the planting has been successful.

suppress phytoplankton blooms by taking up phosphorus 
from the water and to monitor heavy metal pollution in 
rivers. 
 
Erosion control: The wave dampening action of sago 
pondweed can be used for erosion control of shores and 
dams. 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values).  Sago 
pondweed is an obligate wetland species. 
Weediness 
This plant may become weedy or invasive in some 
regions or habitats and may displace desirable vegetation 
if not properly managed.  Please consult with your local 
NRCS Field Office, Cooperative Extension Service 
office, state natural resource, or state agriculture 
department regarding its status and use.  Weed 
information is also available from the PLANTS Web site 
at http://plants.usda.gov.  Please consult the Related Web 
Sites on the Plant Profile for this species for further 
information.  Sago pondweed is considered a nuisance 
weed or noxious weed in some waters that are used for 
recreational purposes  and in irrigation canals. 
Description and Adaptation 
General: Pondweed Family (Potamogetonaceae).  Sago 
pondweed is an aquatic herbaceous plant up to 3 feet tall.  
Sago pondweed is generally completely submersed except 
the reproductive stalk that peaks above the water that 
flowers June – September.  It is nearly un-branched at the 
base, becoming freely branched towards the top.  The 
leaves are ¾ -4.5 inches long and up to ½ inch wide.  The 
flower stalk can be up to 2 inches long.  Fruits are 
yellowish to brown. 
Sago pondweed occurs nearly worldwide and is found 
submerged in semi-permanent to permanently flooded 
areas where the water is less than 8 feet deep.  It can be 
found from sea level to almost 16,000 feet above sea 
level.  Sago pondweed can grow in nearly all bottom 



Page 2
substrates and can tolerate high salinity, pH, and alkaline 
water. 
 
 
 
Figure 2. Sago pondweed distribution from USDA-NRCS PLANTS 
Database 
For updated distribution, please consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
Establishment 
Sago pondweed can be cultured in liquid media for 
experimental purposes from drupelets, turions, rhizomes, 
leafy tops, or cuttings.  Drupelets can be stored in wet or 
dry conditions.  Turions can be harvested and stored for a 
period of up to four years, if dipped in paraffin.  Turions 
can also be stored in water at low temperatures or packed 
in layers of straw or moss. 
Management 
Managers have tried to manipulate populations of sago 
pondweed for use by waterfowl and wildlife by adjusting 
the water levels.  However, results from these trials are 
variable and depend on water chemistry, water levels, 
geography, and other plant competitors.   
Pests and Potential Problems 
Although not conclusive, there are bacteria and fungi that 
may cause diseases in sago pondweed and could be 
responsible for a decline in sago populations or 
deformities of the plants.   
 
Environmental Concerns 
Sago pondweed has been considered a noxious weed in 
waters used for recreational purposes and irrigation. 
Dense formations of sago beds may also limit movement 
of predator fish and inhibit fishing. 
Control 
Please contact your local agricultural extension specialist 
or county weed specialist to learn what works best in your 
area and how to use it safely.  Always read label and 
safety instructions for each control method.  Trade names 
and control measures appear in this document only to 
provide specific information.  USDA NRCS does not 
guarantee or warranty the products and control methods 
named, and other products may be equally effective.  
Many chemical, biological, and physical methods have 
been used to attempt to control growth or numbers of sago 
pondweed.

from mid May to July. The fruits are roundish, dull-white 
berries about 3/8 inch in diameter, soon becoming 
blackish, ripening August or September (Grimm 1993).  
Distribution: Snowberry inhabits slopes and valley 
bottoms of the foothills of the Coast Ranges, the Sierra 
Nevada, and the mountains of southern California 
(McMinn 1939). It extends northward to British Columbia 
and eastward to Pennsylvania and the New England states 
(Ibid.).  
 
For current distribution, please consult the Plant profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site.  
 
Adaptation  
Symphoricarpos albus is found along stream banks, in 
swampy thickets, moist clearings and open forests at sea 
level to middle elevations (Pojar &amp. MacKinnon 1994). It 
tolerates soil types but grows best in heavy clay soils. 
Snowberry grows well in sun or shade.  
 
Establishment  
Propagation by Seed: Symphoricarpos albus seeds are 
best sown in the fall after maturity. Dormancy of this 
species is caused by hard seed coat and immature embryo, 
which can be broken by stratification in sand and peat for 
90 days at 77º, plus 180 days at 41ºF. When the seedlings 
are large enough to handle, place them into individual 
pots and grow them in the greenhouse for their first 
winter. Plant seedlings into their permanent positions in 
late spring or early summer. Management

Management  
Snowberry fruit contains low concentrations of a bitter 
principle, saponin, which foams in water. It is very poorly 
absorbed by the body and can be broken down by 
thoroughly cooking the fruit. Saponin is much more toxic 
to some creatures, such as fish, if eaten in large quantities.

Alternate Names 
Previously known as Aster chilensis Nees, the currently 
accepted name is Symphyotrichum chilense.  Other 
common names include coast aster, Pacific American-
aster, and common California aster.  When it was named 
it was mistakenly thought to occur in Chile, but in fact is 
limited to North America.  There are currently three 
recognized varieties of Pacific aster: S. chilense var. 
chilense, var. invenustum, and var. medium.  
Uses 
Pacific aster can be used in wildlife or pollinator 
enhancement plantings, native prairie restoration, 
meadow gardens, and erosion control or critical area 
plantings.  Its deep, extensive, fibrous root system can 
help stabilize slopes.  
Native aster species (including Symphyotrichum spp.) are 
good late-season pollinator plants, providing a critical 
pollen source for bees active in the late fall, including 
new bumble bee queens building up their energy reserves 
before winter dormancy.  They also serve as nectar 
sources and host plants for checkerspot and crescent 
butterflies. 
 
 
 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
Status 
Pacific aster is considered a facultative plant within its 
native range, meaning it is equally likely to occur in 
wetlands or non-wetlands.  Please consult the PLANTS 
Web site and your State Department of Natural Resources 
for this plant’s current status (e.g., threatened or 
endangered species, state noxious status, and wetland 
indicator values). 
Description and Adaptation 
Pacific aster is a common, native, rhizomatous, 
herbaceous perennial that grows 1 to 4 ft tall.  Plants can 
be clumped or spreading, with one to many ascending or 
erect stems that are hairy towards the tips.  Basal leaves 
are usually hairless, stalked, thin (generally 1 to 8 inches 
long by 0.2 to 1.5 inches wide), and wither by the time the 
plant flowers.  Leaves along the stems are arranged 
alternately, stalkless, and are 1 to 3.5 inches long by 0.2 
to 1.2 inches wide.  Flower heads are arranged in open, 
flat-top or round-top, branched clusters (cymes), with 
violet to pink or white ray flowers (petal-like outer part of 
the aster flower) and yellow disk flowers (centers).  
Bloom time varies by latitude and elevation, but can 
extend from June to October.    
 
Pacific aster distribution from USDA-NRCS PLANTS Database. 
Pacific aster grows in a variety of habitats including 
grasslands, meadows, salt marshes, coastal dunes and 
bluffs, coastal scrub, and open or disturbed areas.  It is 
adapted to fine- to medium-textured soils, full sun to 
partial shade, is relatively drought tolerant, and has a high 
salinity tolerance.  Pacific aster is distributed in coastal 
regions from southwest British Columbia to Southern 
California at elevations below 1600 ft.  For updated 


Page 2
 
distribution, please consult the Plant Profile page for this 
species on the PLANTS Web site. 
Establishment 
Pacific aster does not possess seed dormancy, so 
untreated seed can be sown any time of year, but will 
generally germinate in the spring when soils are moist and 
temperatures reach 60°F.  Standard site preparation 
should include treatment and/or removal of weeds for one 
to two years prior to seeding, and preparation of a clean, 
firm seed bed.  Typical seeding rates for pollinator 
enhancement or restoration plantings are 1 to 2 pounds 
per acre for a single species planting, but would be 
substantially less as part of a mix.  There are 800,000 to 
1,300,000 seeds per pound.   
Plants are also easily established from transplanted plugs 
in the fall or spring.  If seed is not available, plants can be 
propagated from divisions of the rhizome or root crown in 
early spring, but this method is time consuming and 
generally not preferable if other methods are available.

Management 
Pacific aster generally does not require watering, 
fertilization, or other management once established.  
Plants can be cut or mowed to ground level in the late fall 
or winter following the first hard frost and will re-sprout 
in the spring. 
Pests and Potential Problems 
There are no known pests or problems associated with 
Pacific aster. 
Environmental Concerns 
Under optimal conditions (full sun and moist, well-
drained soil), Pacific aster can develop long, vigorous 
rhizomes that allow the plants to spread into thick clumps 
that may outcompete weaker neighboring plants.  Plants 
also produce prolific amounts of wind-born seed that can 
spread and establish in neighboring areas.  Once 
established, Pacific aster plants can be difficult to 
completely remove from an area. 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
There are no developed cultivars of Pacific aster, but 
container plants and seed of local ecotypes are readily 
available from commercial sources throughout the west.

Uses 
Conservation:  Aromatic aster is an adaptable, easy to 
grow ground cover for dry, sunny locations.  It is a native 
plant and can be part of a good wildlife seed mixture 
where native grasses and wildflowers are seeded together.  
Ethno botanical: A tea made from the roots of Asters has 
been used to treat fevers. 
Landscaping and wildlife: Aromatic aster creates showy 
mounds of blooms in fall and is excellent for native 
landscape gardens.  Asters will grow on disturbed sites 
and can be used for wildlife habitat restoration.  Aromatic 
aster is attractive to pollinators including: long-tongued 
bees, short-tongued bees, small to medium-sized 
butterflies and skippers.  Many kinds of insects feed on 
the foliage and other parts of asters, including the 
caterpillars of the butterfly Chlosyne nycteis (Silvery 
Checkerspot) and many moth species.  Wild Turkey and 
other upland game birds eat the seeds and foliage to a 
limited extent.  Mammalian herbivores occasionally eat 
the foliage of asters, even though their food value is low.   
 
Plant Fact Sheet
 
Status 
Aromatic aster is listed as rare in Indiana and as 
threatened in Ohio.  Please consult the PLANTS Web site 
and your State Department of Natural Resources for this 
plant’s current status (e.g. threatened or endangered 
species, state noxious status, and wetland indicator 
values). 
 
Description and Adaptation  
Aromatic aster is a native perennial wildflower that grows 
from 1–3 feet tall.  The aster’s rigid stems branch out 
from the base and give off a balsam-like scent when 
crushed.  The oblong leaves are .5–3 inches long, simple 
(not made up of multiple leaflets), and alternate 
(progressing singly up the stem).  The flowers are 
composite with purple ray flowers along their edges and 
yellow disk flowers within the center. Ray flowers usually 
have a petal which radiates outward from the composite 
flower s center.  There are approximately 30 purple or 
violet ray florets per flower.  The bracts (a modified leaf 
that arises from the stem at the point where the flower or 
flower cluster develops) are glandular with long, green, 
loose or spreading tips.   Flowers appear in fall 
(September-November) and give way to flat, hairy 
achenes (dry fruits).  Aromatic aster spreads by stolons 
(horizontal stems that produce new plants from buds). 
 
Distribution: Aromatic aster grows in well-drained moist 
to dry soils in full sun to partial shade.  It is widely 
distributed from New York west to Montana and south to 
North Carolina and Texas (USDA plant cold hardiness 
zones 4 – 7).  For current distribution, please consult the 
Plant Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
site. 
Habitat:  Aromatic aster is very adaptable as it grows in 
rocky and sandy soils such as those found in prairies and 
bluffs as well as in moist woodland habitats.

Establishment 
Seed propagation 
Seeds can be collected from wild plants in late fall when 
the achenes (dry fruits) separate easily from the 
receptacle. Seeds should be collected in paper bags and 
allowed to dry for 1–2 weeks.  If seeds are sown directly, 
sow them five-eighths of an inch deep in the fall and sow 
thickly.  Plant a cover crop of a cool-season annual grass 
over the seedbed to protect seed over the winter.  If seeds 
are to be propagated in a container, they should be stored 
for 1–3 months at 30–40 degrees Fahrenheit before 
sowing.  Many species of Aster benefit from moisture 
during the cold storage (stratification) period.  Use a 
perlite/vermiculite mix for stratification.  The seed will 
germinate in 10 to 15 days at 72 degrees Fahrenheit.  
Germination to true leaf stage is 7 to 15 days.  Seedlings 
should be thinned at this stage. 
 
Vegetative propagation 
Propagate by softwood cuttings taken in late spring or by 
divisions taken in the spring or autumn. 
 
Management 
Aromatic aster colonizes by stolons, it needs regular 
thinning to control its spread.  Aromatic aster may open 
up if it becomes too top-heavy, so prune it back by no 
more than half in mid-June to keep it thick.  Cut it back to 
the basal rosette (round level ring of leaves at the plants 
base) after it goes dormant in late fall or early winter.  It 
can be transplanted in the spring or autumn.  Aromatic 
aster prefers neutral to slightly acidic soils. 
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Aromatic Aster is susceptible to many leaf spots, rusts, 
and mildews which will affect the lower leaves but 
usually do no permanent damage.  The most destructive 
diseases in the cultivation of asters are various forms of 
stem-rot.  They are of fungal origin and are induced by 
allowing the plants to remain moist for an extended 
period of time.  The infection usually takes place in the 
seed-row, but often no effect is noticed until the plants are 
nearly full-grown, when they suddenly wilt and die.  The 
“yellow disease” causes the plants to have a bleached 
appearance and to make a spindling growth.  Thorough 
cultivation of the soil is the best preventive.   
 
Environmental Concerns 
No concerns at this time. 
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
There are no recommended cultivars or selected materials 
at this time.  Aromatic aster may be available from 
commercial nurseries specializing in native plants.

during the cold storage (stratification) period.  Use a 
perlite/vermiculite mix for stratification.  The seed will 
germinate in 10 to 15 days at 72 degrees Fahrenheit.  
Germination to true leaf stage is 7 to 15 days.  Seedlings 
are thinned at this stage. 
 
Vegetative propagation 
Propagate by softwood cuttings taken in late spring. 
 
Management 
Crooked-stem aster colonizes by horizontal stems which 
grow at the soil surface, so thin it regularly to control its 
spread.  Crooked-stem aster may open up if it becomes 
too top-heavy, so prune it back by no more than half in 
mid-June to keep it thick.  After it goes dormant in late 
fall or early winter cut it back to the round level ring of 
leaves at the plants base.  Crooked-stem aster prefers 
neutral to slightly acidic soils. 
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Crooked stem aster is susceptible to many leaf spots, rusts 
and mildews which will affect the lower leaves but 
usually do no permanent damage.  The most destructive 
diseases in the cultivation of asters are various forms of 
stem-rot.  They are of fungus origin and are induced by 
allowing the plants to remain moist for an extended 
period of time.  The infection usually takes place in the 
seed-row, but often no effect is noticed until the plants are 
nearly full-grown, when they suddenly wilt and die.  The 
“yellow disease” causes the plants to have a bleached 
appearance and to make a spindling growth.  Thorough 
cultivation of the soil is the best preventive. 
 
Environmental Concerns 
No concerns at this time. 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
There are no recommended cultivars or selected materials 
at this time.  Crooked stem aster is available from 
commercial nurseries specializing in native plants.

POWDERY THALIA 
Thalia dealbata Fraser ex Roscoe 
Plant Symbol = THDE 
Contributed by: USDA NRCS Jamie L. Whitten Plant 
Materials Center, Coffeeville, MS 
 
Figure 1 Powdery thalia in flower. 
 
Alternate Names 
Other common names: powdery alligator-flag or water 
canna. 
Uses 
Powdery thalia is recommended for use in backyard 
ponds as an aquatic ornamental and constructed wetlands 
for home septic systems.  It may have some benefit as a 
waterfowl food because ducks will eat the seed.  
Status 
Powdery thalia is listed as endangered in Illinois.  This 
plant is considered an obligate wetland indicator species.  
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
Description and Adaptation 
Powdery thalia is a rhizomatous, herbaceous perennial 
with a bluish, glaucous coating on leaves, flower stalks, 
and flowers.
 
Plant Fact Sheet
The 3-4 foot tall leaves arise from the base of the plant 
with a stout petiole and a large, elongated leaf blade. The 
attractive purple to bluish flower clusters are produced at 
the top of a stalk extending 2-3 feet above the foliage. 
Each fruit consists of a bladdery, paper-like covering 
loosely surrounding a single seed. The seed are round to 
oval and dark brown speckled with tan when mature.  
Flowers are produced from late May to September with 
fruit maturing throughout the summer. There are about 
1275 seeds per pound.  Powdery thalia is usually found 
growing in wet ditches and along the margins of ponds on 
sites where the soil often contains a high level of organic 
matter. The nutrient loading capacity for sewage effluent 
has not been determined. however, powdery thalia will 
tolerate those levels normally found in a single residence 
septic system. It can tolerate water depths up to 1.5 feet 
during the growing season with deeper flooding tolerated 
during the dormant season.   The species occurs in the 
Coastal Plain from South Carolina to Texas and also in 
Oklahoma and Missouri.  
 
 
Powdery thalia distribution from USDA-NRCS PLANTS Database. 
 
For updated distribution, please consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
Establishment 
To ensure survival in a wetland site, vegetative 
propagules are required.  Planting can be done throughout 
the year in the southeastern states. Planting pieces should 
consist of a 4-6 inch section of rhizome with several 
growing points.  If the plants are actively growing, the 
shoots should not be cut shorter than 6-8 inches.  A two-
foot spacing will allow the plants to easily fill in the 
planting area in one growing season.
 
 
 


Page 2
The planting hole should allow for the length of the 
rhizome and should be deep enough for one inch of soil to 
cover the top of the rhizome. Water levels should be kept 
at about 1-2 inches until the plants become established 
and should never be allowed to cover the entire shoot of 
non-dormant plants.  In a constructed wetland, sewage 
effluent should not be introduced into the water until the 
plants become established.  Although seedlings rarely 
establish naturally in most wetland situations, seedlings 
can be produced easily indoors.  Seed collection should be 
delayed until the majority of the fruit in the cluster has 
turned brown, because immature fruit will fall from the 
cluster along with ripe ones when the cluster is shaken to 
remove the fruit.  It is not necessary to remove the fruit 
coverings before sowing, but this is easily done by 
rubbing.  The seed can be stored dry, but should be placed 
in a moist medium and stored in the refrigerator for three 
months before sowing.  The growing medium must be 
kept moist, but not saturated and air temperatures should 
be at least 75°F.  The seedlings can be planted in the 
wetland when they are approximately one foot tall. 
Management 
During the dormant season, old flower stalks and dead 
foliage can be removed, but it is a good idea to leave a 
long enough section of the leaf petiole so the cut end 
remains above the water level. 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Some minor, mainly aesthetic damage by leaf rolling 
insects has been noted. 
Environmental Concerns 
Light applications of a complete fertilizer will improve 
growth throughout the growing season, but care should be 
taken to prevent fertilizer movement into the ground 
water.  In a constructed wetland, the levels of nutrients 
applied in the sewage may be sufficient to maintain 
acceptable growth.

mixtures management is based upon the grasses 
rather than the legumes.  Graze or cut crimson clover 
for hay when in the early bloom stage (¼ to ½ in 
bloom).  When used as a winter pasture, grazing too 
closely will affect the stand and the seed and forage

heads become hard and tough.  If used as a green 
manure, manage the crop so it is plowed under about 
2 to 3 weeks before the next crop is planted.

The proper time of seeding is determined by seasonal

Management for forage is aimed at maintaining 40% 
to 50% clover.  Close grazing (2 inch stubble height) 
favors clover, whereas light grazing favors grass.  
Well-fertilized grass will outgrow clover in fall and 
winter and could smother the clover. 
Spring applications of nitrogen will stimulate grass 
and provide early feed, but excessive rates are 
detrimental to the clover stand.  Phosphate

The three general types of white clover usually 
recognized are (1) large, (2) intermediate, and (3) 
small. 
Large type: ‘Ladino’ is the recommended cultivar of 
the large type.  It is two to four times as large as 
common white clover.  It is very well suited to the 
interior areas of western Oregon, away from the 
coast.  It will winter kill under dry winter conditions, 
and is susceptible to slug damage.  It requires a high 
soil phosphate level and good management for 
maximum production.  ‘Pilgrim’ and ‘Merit’ have 
been developed for winter hardiness. 
Intermediate type: ‘Grassland Huia’ is representative 
of the intermediate type.  It was formerly designated 
‘New Zealand’.  It is very well adapted to locations 
along the coast and interior western Oregon where 
slugs are a problem. 
Small type: “New York’ wild white clover is an 
example of the small type, which is adapted to higher

SEA OATS 
Uniola paniculata
Plant Symbol = UNPA 
 L. 
Contributed by: USDA NRCS East Texas Plant 
Materials Center 
 R. Alan Shadow 
USDA NRCS East Texas Plant Material Center 
Uses 
Landscaping: 
Sea Oats is an attractive and important plant of the 
coastal community.  Seed heads from this plant are 
sometimes used in floral arrangements.  However, it 
should be noted that this species is protected in some 
states due to the vital role it plays in shoreline 
stabilization.  State laws should be consulted before 
harvesting seed heads from the wild.  Sea Oats is 
very valuable as a dune builder and stabilizer. 
 
Forage: 
Sea Oats is reported to have high palatability to 
browsing animals and moderate palatability to 
grazing animals.  However, due to the location of its 
habitat, protected status, and low protein content, it 
has no value as a forage plant.   
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s 
current status (e.g. threatened or endangered species, 
state noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
 
Plant Fact Sheet
Description and Adaptation 
Sea oats is a long lived, slow growing, warm season, 
perennial grass commonly associated with the upper 
dunes along beach fronts.  It grows erect to 
approximately 6 feet in height at maturity, and has 
leaves that can grow to 24 inches in length.  The 
leaves are narrow, less than 1 inch in width, and taper 
towards their ends.  The ends of the leaves are often 
brown and curled in appearance.  It produces a large 
seed head, or panicle, during the summer.  The 
panicles are made up of many flat spikelets 
containing seed.  The panicle turns from green to 
straw colored in late summer as the plant matures.  
The stem of the plant has bulges, or nodes, near the 
soil surface.  These will often root down and anchor 
to the soil surface as wind born sediment accumulates 
around the plant.  Sea oats is also rhizomatous.  
These rhizomes have a scale-like appearance when 
young, and can be seen as pale yellow, sharp, stiff, 
protrusions near the base of the plant.   
 
Sea oats is very drought tolerant.  This species 
produces a massive root system, and will tolerate salt 
spray and brief inundation with salt water.  It prefers 
full sun, and thrives in areas with blowing sand, such 
as dunes along the upper beach front.  Burial of the 
plant’s base by blowing sand actually stimulates plant 
growth and helps the plant spread via rhizomes and 
tacking down at the stem nodes.  It prefers coarse 
sediments, but will tolerate medium grained 
sediments.  It will not tolerate fine grained sediments, 
and has a difficult time surviving in lower, wetter 
portions of the beach area.   Though it is capable of 
surviving brief inundations of salt water, it will not 
tolerate water logging.       
 
Distribution:  Sea oats can be found on beach fronts 
and barrier islands along the eastern seaboard of the 
United States from Virginia to Florida.   Their range 
extends along the coast line of the Gulf States, south 
into portions of Mexico.  It can also be found in the 
Bahamas and portions of Cuba.              
 
Establishment 
Sea oats is not a prolific seed producer.  It produces 
large panicles with numerous spikelets.  However, 
very few seed are actually produced.  Seed is viable 
and will grow readily in greenhouse conditions.  
However, there are no sources of commercial seed 
available.    
 
Sea oats is predominantly established from 
containerized material and vegetative propagules.

This species is rhizomatous and can be expanded by 
splitting larger plants into smaller propagules.  Sea 
oats is relatively slow growing and will require time 
to recover from the shock of being split into smaller 
units and transplanting.  It responds well to 
fertilization, but requires little to no nutrient input in 
field situations.      
 
Plantings on 2-5 foot centers have proven to be very 
effective.  Due to the harsh environment this species 
inhabits, there is little competition from other plants.  
Site prep work is usually not needed.  Plantings in 
early spring or fall produce the least amount of stress 
by allowing establishment time before the harshest 
portions of the year arrive.  Though this species is 
very drought tolerant, plantings should be timed 
when adequate moisture is present.  This will help 
reduce the shock associated with transplanting.        
 
Management 
Once established, Sea oats require very little 
management.   Traffic into newly planted areas 
should be limited until the plants have become 
successfully established.  A slow release fertilizer 
pellet is beneficial during early establishment.  
However, routine fertilization is not required.     
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
There are no known pests or potential problems 
associated with this species. 
 
Environmental Concerns 
Sea oats is an extremely valuable plant for coast line 
and barrier island protect.  Its massive root system is 
capable of holding soil and sand in place during 
extreme weather events such as hurricanes and 
tropical storms.  This plant’s habitat puts it at the 
forefront of shoreline protection.  It is also capable of 
catching blowing sand and building dunes.  It is very 
important to natural and artificial dune stabilization 
throughout much of its range.

swamps, lakes and flood-prone areas.  V. 
corymbosum also occurs in drier areas such as dunes 
and barrier beaches, rocky hillsides, oak woods, and 
pinewoods.

of the complex are partially or completely self-
incompatible.   Bees are the primary pollinators.  The 
seeds may be widely dispersed by birds and 
mammals, but germination can be reduced up to 15% 
after passing through an animal gut.   In the southern 
portion of its range, highbush blueberry seeds have 
thick seed coats and require cold stratification before 
germination.  Those from northern regions produce 
thinner seed coats and germinate in the autumn after 
dispersal.   
Plants of highbush blueberry can be propagated by 
seeds or cuttings. 
Occasionally sprouting has occurred from root-
crowns after top kill by fire or disturbance.  Plants 
have also been noted to produce root sprouts that 
emerge 1-2 meters away from the parent plant.

Alternate Names 
Swamp vervain 
Swamp verbena 
Uses   
Ethnobotanical: Blue vervain is used internally to treat 
depression, fevers, coughs, cramps, jaundice, and 
headaches.  Externally, it is used for acne, ulcers, and 
cuts.   
Warning: Blue vervain can interfere with blood pressure 
medication and hormone therapy.  Large doses will 
induce vomiting and diarrhea.   
Landscaping: Blue vervain produces very attractive 
purplish-blue flowers in late summer.  It can grow in 
degraded wetland habitats and is an excellent landscaping 
substitute for several invasive species, including 
European wand loosestrife, purple loosestrife, and purple 
foxglove. 
Wildlife: The cardinal, swamp sparrow, field sparrow, 
song sparrow, and slate-colored junco eat the seeds of 
blue vervain.  The cottontail rabbit will sometimes eat the 
foliage. most other mammalian herbivores avoid it due its

bitter taste.  The caterpillars of the verbena moth feed on 
the leaves and it is the larval host for the common 
buckeye butterfly.  Long and short tongued bees collect 
the nectar and sometimes the pollen.  Other bee 
pollinators include: epoline cuckoo bees, eucerine miner 
bees , halictid bees, and the verbena bee, a specialist 
pollinator.  In addition the thread-waisted wasp, bee 
flies, thick-headed flies and golden soldier beetle are also 
known to all visit blue vervain.   
 
Description and Adaptation  
Blue vervain is a native, perennial wildflower that grows 
from 2 to 5 feet tall.  Its hairy, square stems can be green 
or red.  The toothed, lance shaped leaves progress in pairs 
up the stem and are about 6 inches long by 1 inch wide. 
 Purplish-blue flowers bloom in multiple, showy, 
elongated panicles (flowers arranged on a stem) and are 
up to 5 inches long.  Each bloom is about 1/4 inch across 
and conspicuously lobed.  Blue vervain blooms in mid to 
late summer. approximately 1 1/2 months after blooming 
each bloom gives way to four oblong, reddish-brown, 
triangular-convex “nutlets.”  Blue vervain spreads 
through rhizomes, horizontal roots that produce new 
plants.   
  
Blue vervain prefers moist conditions and full to partial 
sun.  It can grow in disturbed sites and is commonly 
found in moist meadows, thickets, and pastures, as well as 
riversides, marshes, ditches, and river-bottom prairies.

Establishment  
General: Collect nutlets in late summer or early fall and 
spread them over a clean, dry, indoor surface for several 
days.  Once the nutlets are dry, crush them lightly to

release the ripe seeds.  The seeds should be stratified 
before sowing by storing in a sealed, labeled container or 
plastic bag with wet sand or peat moss at 38 to 40 degrees 
Fahrenheit for three months.  
Propagation by seeds: After stratifying, sow seeds in a 
soil mix of one-third sand and two-thirds commercial plug 
mix.  Keep the seeds well-lit and the air temperature 
between 60 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.  Established plants 
will self-seed in the fall.   
Propagation by cuttings: Take 3 to 4 inch long stem tip 
cuttings in early spring.  Remove the lower leaves and 
insert the stems into a sand and perlite rooting medium.  
In 4 to 5 weeks the cuttings should be well rooted and can 
be transplanted.  (For blue vervain, seed propagation is 
often preferred over propagation by cuttings.) 
   
Management  
Pinch off the tops of the plants several times during the 
growing season to encourage branching and a bushier 
growth habit.

Uses 
Conservation:  Culver’s root is a native, clumping, 
perennial wildflower growing well in moist to wet 
meadows and prairies. It is a good component of a 
pollinator seed mixture seeding native grasses and 
wildflowers together. It grows easily in sunny locations 
and combines well with wildflowers such as asters, bee 
balm, cardinal flower, swamp milkweed, goldenrods and 
ironweeds.

Plant Fact Sheet
 
Wildlife:  The most common visitors to the flowers are 
long and short tongued bees, which collect pollen and 
nectar. Other pollinators include honeybees, bumblebees, 
mason bees, green metallic bees and masked bees. Other 
insect visitors include sphecid wasps, butterflies, moths 
and syrphid flies.  The seeds are too small to be of interest 
to birds.   
Ethnobotanical:  The Cherokee, Iroquois, Chippewa and 
Menominee Indians used this plant for a multitude of 
medicines. It is used as an analgesic, cathartic 
(accelerated defecation), emetic (induces vomiting), 
treatment for coughs, fevers and rheumatism and to assist 
with childbirth.   
Landscape:  Culver’s root is a tall, durable, adaptable and 
easily grown. It’s beautiful (usually white, purple to pink) 
flowers occur at a time of year (July - September) when 
most other plants are not flowering.  It sometimes needs 
staking and is a good wildflower for meadows, borders, 
wetlands and rain gardens.  It makes a nice cut flower 
lasting as much as a week in fresh arrangements. 
Status 
Culvers root is threatened in Massachusetts and New 
York and endangered in Vermont.  Please consult the 
PLANTS Web site and your State Department of Natural 
Resources for this plant’s current status (e.g., threatened 
or endangered species, state noxious status, and wetland 
indicator values). 
Description and Adaptation

For updated distribution, please consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
Description:  Culver’s root is a native perennial 
wildflower growing 3 to 6 feet tall. The genus name 
Veronicastrum is a combination of Veronica and the 
suffix astrum (false), which describes this plants 
resemblance to Veronicas. It is one of only two species in 
the genus. Its common name probably originates from an 
eighteenth century doctor or herbalist who popularized its 
use for various ailments. The central stem is round and 
smooth.  Along the stem are 3 to 7 leaves arranged so that 
all leaves are attached at the same point and wrap around 
the stem (whorled).  These leaves are up to 6 inches long 
with finely toothed (serrated) edges.  At the top of the 
plant slender spikes of white, pink or blue flowers up to 8 
inches long appear from July – September. These flowers, 
which bloom from the top to the bottom, are not fragrant, 
last about a month and resemble a candelabrum. The 
small seeds can be carried by the wind several feet from 
the mother plant.  The root system has a central taproot as 
well as underground stems (rhizomes).   
Establishment 
General:  The seed capsules are produced in large 
quantities within the small woody capsules.  Collect the 
capsules when they are yellow, they will turn brown when 
fully ripe. The seeds do not fall out of the capsules easily 
and usually have to be slightly crushed (a rolling pin 
works well) in order for the seed to be released.  A very 
small screen should be used to separate the seed from the 
chaff.  The seed should be stratified before sowing by 
storing in a sealed, labeled container or plastic bag with 
wet sand or peat moss at 38 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit for 
90 days. 
Propagation by seeds:  After stratifying sow seeds in a 
soil mix of one-third sand and two-thirds commercial plug 
mix. Keep the seeds will-lit (light is required for 
germination) and the air temperature between 60 and 80 
degrees Fahrenheit.  Germination percentages are usually 
high (80% range), and seedlings are large enough to 
transplant by midsummer. Even though Culver’s root is 
found in damp sunny locations and sometimes wetlands, 
the greatest threat to seedling survival is overwatering.  
To establish a native wildflower and grass meadow, sow 
about 15,000 seed (.2ounces.) per acre with a native seed 
drill or comparable equipment.  Plants grown from seed 
will flower in their second year.   
 
Propagation by cuttings/division:  Culver’s root is most 
easily propagated by divisions in the late fall or early 
spring. Each rootstock segment must have a bud to be 
successful.   
Two to three node tip cuttings (softwood) root easily in 
the late spring.   
Management 
It grows slowly for the first year but recovers in the 
second growing season. Although it is adaptable to 
growing in various soils and moisture levels, it is not an 
overly aggressive wildflower. The stems of Culver’s root 
l may need staking. Pinching back the plants will sacrifice 
the architectural effect of the foliage. 
Pests and Potential Problems 
No known or potential problems at this time. 
Environmental Concerns 
No known environmental concerns. 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials  
Culver’s root is available from nurseries specializing in 
native plants, ‘Lavender Towers’ is a cultivar with pale 
purple flowers.  .

The beetle larvae hatch in early May, feed for about 
4-5 weeks then pupate in the soil.  Adults emerge by 
mid-July, feed, mate, and lay over-wintering eggs in 
a straight line on viburnum twigs.  The over-
wintering eggs should be pruned out and destroyed 
before hatching.  Chemical control is best applied to 
young larvae, which feed on both upper and lower

Description and Adaptation 
American vetch is a native, perennial, climbing vine that 
grows approximately 1 to 2 feet tall.  Each plant has a 
single stem.  Tendrils emerge from the end of the multiple 
leaflets to help secure the plant to the climbing structure.  
The purple flowers, which are gathered together in 
racemes (flower stalks) of 3 to 10 flowers, appear in late 
spring (May through August) and give way to 1 to 1.5 
inch pods about one month after flowering.  Each pod 
contains two or more pea like brown seeds.  American 
vetch spreads through rhizomes (roots that spread out 
from the parent plant and produce new plants).  
 
Distribution: American vetch grows in medium- to finely-
textured moist to dry soils in full sun.  It is widely 
distributed west of the Mississippi River and in the 
northeastern United States (USDA cold hardiness zones 4 
through 7). 
 
Habitat: American vetch grows in open patches in 
swampy woods, road banks, fencerows, borders, mixed 
forests, meadows, foothill canyons, and clearings.

Uses 
Crop: American vetch fixes nitrogen and can be grown as 
a cover preceding late spring-planted crops.   
Conservation:  American vetch is a drought-tolerant 
climbing vine excellent for sunny and partially shady 
locations.  It is a native plant and can be part of a wildlife 
seed mixture where native grasses and wildflowers are 
seeded together.  It will support itself using tall grasses 
such as rye . 
Ethnobotanical:  Native Americans used the pods, seeds, 
and leaves of American vetch as food.  A poultice of the 
leaves has been used to treat spider bites, an infusion of 
the plant has been used as eyewash and an infusion of the 
tops has been used as a wash in sweat houses. American 
vetch has also been used as a panacea, an aphrodisiac, and 
a good luck charm.  Native Americans would get horses

Landscaping and wildlife: American vetch is an excellent 
grazing and fodder plant for game birds, small mammals, 
black bear, grizzly bear, and mule deer.  Horses, sheep, 
and cattle will browse on the aerial portions of American 
vetch.   Growing in disturbed sites it can be planted to 
help restore roadsides, former coal mine sites and

American vetch distribution from USDA-NRCS PLANTS Database. 
 
For updated distribution, please consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
 
Establishment 
Direct sow American vetch in the fall.  Unscarified seed 
will germinate in approximately 14 days.  Scarification 
(scratching or etching) the seeds will decrease their 
germination time to 3 to 7 days but will not improve their 
overall germination capacity.  Due to the climbing habit 
of the plant, it is often sown in combination with rye with 
the rye providing support.  In a mixture, 50 pounds of rye 
and 15 to 20 pounds of vetch per acre should be used.  
Most varieties of vetch are seeded at 20 to 40 pounds per 
acre.  American vetch will self-reseed. 
 
Management 
American vetch  grows in moist to dry soils and typically 
reaches its full height only if it attaches itself to a 
supporting structure.  It prefers full sun and neutral to 
slightly acidic soil.   
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Vicia  spp. is susceptible to several species of Botrytis 
fungus.  Vetch seeds are also susceptible to vetch bruchid 
(Bruchus brachialis) injury.  This insect pest is largely 
responsible for poor natural reseeding of vetch in 
pastures.  
 
Environmental Concerns 
No concerns known environmental concerns. 
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
There are no recommended cultivars or selected materials 
at this time.

UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_Description='Wild cowpea is a native, perennial, herbaceous vine 
that has trailing or twining branches that can grow to 
three feet in length or longer.  Previously known by 
the scientific name Vigna repens, it has several 
common names including wild cowpea, hairypod 
cowpea, and deer pea.  It is a member of the 
papilionoideae subfamily of the Fabaceae (legume) 
family.  Wild cowpea has been known to nodulate.   
Wild cowpea is trifoliate with yellow zygomorphic 
(bilaterally symmetrical) flowers at the end of a long 
peduncle.  It flowers from April to November in 
South Texas.  It produces several fairly large seeds in 
pods 1-2 ½ inches long.  Its vines often form dense 
tangles.

UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_AdaptationandDistribution='Wild cowpea grows along coastal regions from 
tropical areas of Central and South America, north 
along the Gulf Coast states, and up the Atlantic 
seaboard as far north as North Carolina.  It has also 
been found in Zimbabwe, Africa.  In Texas, it is 
found in the coastal counties, inland to Hidalgo 
County, and along the barrier islands.  
Wild cowpea grows in wet pastures, along levees, 
elevated ridges, and on well-drained sites near along 
the edge of fresh-water to brackish swamps.  It 
prefers moist to wet clay soils, although at the Kika 
de la Garza Plant Materials Center in Kingsville, 
Texas, we have been able to grow it dryland on 
Victoria Clay soil with good success.  Wild cowpea 
will tolerate a wide range of salinities, ranging from 0 
to 10 ppt.

in part to accession differences.  One wild cowpea 
accession consistently had better than 93% 
germination, while a second accession had less than 
10%.   
Wild cowpea can be seeded directly or grown in 
cone-tainers in a greenhouse to produce transplants.

lanceolate, sessile or nearly so, and mostly opposite.  
Leaves are generally scabrous or strigose on both 
sides and turn black after drying.   
 
The flower stems are terminal and solitary or 
occasionally in a cyme of three.  The flower heads 
are about 3 cm across.  The ray flowers are broad, 
conspicuous, 7-15 in number, with the corollas being 
yellow or orange.  Both the disk and ray flowers 
produce achenes.  The plants bloom and produce seed 
from March to December.

Germination tests conducted at the Kika de la Garza 
Plant Material Center (1999) found germination rates 
ranging from a low of 1% to a high of 73%.    
 
For direct seeding, broadcast seed in the late winter 
or early spring into a clean, weed free seedbed.  
Seeds should be covered from ¼ to ½” depth to 
ensure good soil to seed contact.  Transplants should 
be planted in early to mid-spring, to ensure good root

Orange zexmenia can be harvested with a combine.  
When harvesting orange zexmenia, run the combine’s 
cylinder speed at 900 RPM, the concave is at 6 mm, 
the sieve is open ¼”, and the fan is off.  Orange 
zexmenia can also be harvested using a weed eater 
with a stripper attachment.  To clean the seed, it 
should first be run through a brush machine and can 
then be cleaned further using a clipper style seed 
cleaner.  It is recommended that after cleaning, the 
seed should be stored at 45oF and less than 50% 
humidity.  Dryland (non-irrigated) field production 
can yield 60 pounds of seed per acre per year.

leaves are up to 8 centimeters long and 5 centimeters 
across, have finely serrated margins, generally 
lanceolate or ovate in shape and the larger leaves 
usually have 1 or 2 sharp lobes.  Lower (basal) leaves 
are twice or three times compound with long petioles, 
while the upper leaves are once compound with short 
petioles.  Golden Alexanders is most noteworthy for 
its attractive bright yellow flower which occurs from 
May – June.  The flower is less than .3 centimeters 
long. Each flower has 5 sepals, 5 petals and 5 
stamens. A cluster of flowers gathers into an 8 
centimeter long flat-topped flower head, the middle 
flower of each compound umbel being stalk less.  
Flowers give way to 3 – 4 millimeter long, oblong, 
green fruit capsules.  The leaves as well as the fruit 
slowly turn light purple in the autumn. 
 
Golden Alexanders is a carefree plant which occurs 
naturally in small colonies on wet soils.  It prefers 
wet sites, but is very tolerant of dry conditions in the 
summer.  The preference is for full to partial sun, 
although light shade under trees is tolerated.      
     
Distribution: This species is widely distributed from 
Quebec to Saskatoon, south to Florida and Texas in 
USDA hardiness zones 4 – 9.  Habitats include: moist 
black soil prairies, openings in moist to mesic 
woodlands, savannas, thickets, limestone glades and 
bluffs, power line clearings in woodland areas, and 
abandoned fields.

UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_Description='Grass Family (Poaceae).  Giant cutgrass is a 
warm-season, rhizomatous perennial grass.  The 
height is between 3 to 9 feet.  The leaf blade is long 
and flat, rough on edges, almost sawlike.  The leaf 
sheath is rounded and opens with shorter than 
internodes.  The seedhead is narrow and nodding 
panicles, spikelets unisexual, 1-flowered, male and 
female on same branch of panicle.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD fs_Management TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_Management='For maximum production, no more than 50 percent of 
current growth by weight should be removed at any 
season.  Controlled burning is recommended if 
enough dead leaves and stems accumulate on the 
ground to smother new growth.  Burn only when 
there is at least 1 inch of water above soil surface.  
Defer grazing after burning to permit 8 inches of re-
growth.  Cattle walkways are essential to distribute 
grazing and provide access to forage on fresh 
marshes where this grass is important.

ALTER TABLE usda_plants ADD fs_Establishment TEXT;
UPDATE usda_plants SET fs_Establishment='Although a warm-season grass, giant cutgrass grows 
some in late fall along the gulf coast.  It produces 
seed mostly in spring and early summer.  It grows in 
dense bunches from large, creeping rhizomes.  
Mature plants turn yellowish after first frost, but 
usually have green basal leaves all year.  It grows 
primarily on firm mineral clays or silt soils.  Also, it 
grows in fresh-water marshes and swamps, on creek 
and riverbanks, and in drainage ditches and canals.  It 
tolerates a small amount of salt in free soil water.  It 
does best if the water level fluctuates from soil 
surface to 12 inches above.
